"<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hello! Welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Neil.
<h3><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And I'm Catherine. And today we're talking about hyphenation.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hyphens are those little signs &ndash; like dashes &ndash; that we use in writing to join two words together.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, like in <strong>old-fashioned. </strong>There's always a hyphen between<strong> old </strong>and <strong>fashioned. </strong>Let's start with a clip from Brian. He's a news reporter, and he's reporting from a high school about an election.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Think about this question while you're listening: How does Brian describe the young people at the school? Here's Brian.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Brian<br/></strong>I asked some <strong>eighteen-year-old</strong> students at <strong>this secondary school</strong> how they're voting in this year's election. They're all <strong>hard-working </strong>young people. <strong>Twenty-two</strong> of them are undecided and are likely to make a <strong>last-minute</strong> decision. But a sizable group say today's politicians are not <strong>well respected</strong> and their attitudes are <strong>out of date</strong>. Back to the studio.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So we asked you: How does Brian describe the young people at the school? &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the answer is: He says they are <strong>hard-working.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That means they work hard. Now there are lots of compound adjectives like <strong>hard-working</strong> that we make with an adjective or adverb like <strong>hard</strong> plus a present participle like <strong>working</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And we always write them with a hyphen. So <strong>hard hyphen working</strong> (hard-working).</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And we can make compound adjectives in other ways too. Listen to this clip for three more examples.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Brian<br/></strong>I asked some <strong>eighteen-year-old</strong> students at this<strong> secondary school</strong> how they're voting in this year's election. <strong>Twenty-two</strong> of them are undecided and are likely to make a <strong>last-minute</strong> decision.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>First we had <strong>eighteen-year-old</strong> <strong>students</strong>. <strong>Eighteen-year-old</strong> is an adjective made from three words joined together with hyphens. When we write age before a noun, we use hyphens.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Eighteen hyphen year hyphen old</strong> (eighteen-year-old)<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Exactly. And it's the same with numbers; for example, we write the phrase <strong>a two-door car</strong> like this:</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>A two hyphen door car</strong> (a two-door car)<strong>. </strong>But that's only for numbers <strong>before</strong> the noun. If you write: <strong>the students are eighteen years old</strong>, you don't need hyphens.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now, the second compound in that clip was <strong>twenty-two</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And the rule is: always use hyphens in numbers from <strong>twenty-one</strong> to <strong>ninety-nine</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Twenty hyphen one </strong>(twenty-one). Two hundred and <strong>ninety hyphen nine </strong>(two hundred and ninety-nine).</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Good. Now the last compound adjective we had there was <strong>last-minute. </strong>The students were going to make a <strong>last-minute</strong> decision.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And that's the adjective <strong>last</strong> plus the noun <strong>minute</strong>, joined with a hyphen. Now for another clip. Listen out for some more compound adjectives.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Brian<br/></strong>A sizable group say today's politicians are not <strong>well respected</strong> and their attitudes are <strong>out of date.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Well respected. </strong>That's an adverb, <strong>well</strong>, and the past participle of a verb, <strong>respected</strong>. And together, they make an adjective, and the two parts of the adjective need a hyphen when we write them before a noun.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So it's a<strong> well-respected politician</strong>, with a hyphen: <strong>well hyphen respected politician </strong>(well-respected politician).</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes. But in a phrase like <strong>the politicians were well respected </strong>we don't use a hyphen, because the adjective comes after the noun, not before. And that rule is the same for three-word compound adjectives like <strong>out-of-date</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So, the phrase<strong> out-of-date attitudes</strong> has hyphens because the adjective is before the noun, but the phrase <strong>their attitudes are out of date</strong> doesn't have hyphens.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Exactly. And one last rule is that we never use hyphens in compound adjectives that have an adverb which ends in <strong>-l-y</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, we don't. So in phrases like<strong> a carefully written letter</strong> we don't use hyphens.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now let's talk about <strong>compound</strong> <strong>nouns</strong>. In our clip, Brian was reporting from a secondary school. The phrase <strong>s</strong><strong>econdary school</strong> is a compound noun - and there's no hyphen in it.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, there isn't. Most compound nouns are written as two separate words.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>If you're not sure, check in a good dictionary.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>IDENT</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from the BBC.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And it's time for a quiz! Number one: What's the compound adjective in this sentence and does it need a hyphen? <strong>We were late because of the slow-moving traffic.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Slow-moving</strong> is the compound adjective, and it needs a hyphen.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>Very good! And number two. Is there a hyphen in <strong>a forty-mile run</strong>?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Yes, there is. <strong>Forty hyphen mile run</strong> (forty-mile run)<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Number three: <strong>The teacher was very well liked</strong>. Is there a hyphen in <strong>well liked</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We don't need a hyphen there.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well done if you got those right. And before we go, here's a vocabulary tip. When you are reading, make a note of compound adjectives and nouns with - and without - hyphens. Keep a list and check it regularly.</p>

<p><strong>Both<br/></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Hello! Welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me, Catherine&hellip;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>&hellip;and me, Neil. In this programme, we&rsquo;re looking at reporting verbs. They&rsquo;re verbs that we use when we talk about what someone else has said.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>So verbs like <strong>suggest</strong>, <strong>deny</strong> and <strong>insist. </strong>Let&rsquo;s start by listening to Simon. And Simon is a political news reporter.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And while you&rsquo;re listening to Simon&rsquo;s news report, here&rsquo;s a question for you to think about:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Why did the minister lie in her previous interview?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Simon<br/></strong></span><span>In a previous interview, the minister had <strong>denied</strong> knowing anything about the scandal. However, she later <strong>apologised for</strong> saying this and <strong>admitted</strong> that she had lied. She <strong>insisted</strong> that she had not intended to cause any harm and <strong>suggested</strong> that it had been necessary to protect certain important public figures. When <strong>advised</strong> to reconsider her position, she had initially <strong>demanded</strong> to know why, but eventually <strong>offered</strong> to resign.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We asked: Why did the minister lie in her previous interview?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And the answer is: she <strong>suggested</strong> that it had been necessary to protect certain important public figures.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Scandal. Now it&rsquo;s interesting that the report uses the verb <strong>suggested</strong>. So why didn&rsquo;t Simon use <strong>said</strong> - She <strong>said</strong> that&hellip;?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, <strong>suggested</strong> tells us that the minister said it, but not in a very strong or direct way. And that&rsquo;s because she didn&rsquo;t want to embarrass the important public figures. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And that&rsquo;s an example of why reporting verbs are useful. We can always use <strong>say, tell</strong> or <strong>ask</strong>, but other reporting verbs express slightly different meanings and attitudes. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, they do. So reporting verbs make your writing or speaking more accurate and more interesting too. Now listen for more reporting verbs in this clip.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>CLIP 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></strong>In a previous interview, the minister had <strong>denied</strong> knowing anything about the scandal. However, she later <strong>apologised</strong> <strong>for</strong> saying this and <strong>admitted</strong> that she had lied.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So we heard<strong> denied knowing anything. Denied</strong> has a negative meaning. It means she said she didn&rsquo;t know anything about the scandal. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. But then she<strong> apologised for saying this. </strong>She said she was sorry for saying this.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And lastly, she <strong>admitted that she had lied</strong>. <strong>Admit </strong>is the opposite of<strong> deny. </strong>It means you say that something is true. We usually use <strong>admit</strong> when someone has to say that something is true, although they would prefer not to.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And now on to the next clip.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>CLIP 2<br/></strong></span><span>She <strong>insisted</strong> that she had not intended to cause any harm and <strong>suggested</strong> that it had been necessary to protect certain important public figures.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>There we heard the verb <strong>insisted</strong>. <strong>To insist</strong> means to say something strongly, especially when other people say something different.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, the minister said strongly that it was incorrect that she had intended to cause harm.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Now we&rsquo;ve already looked at the verb <strong>suggested</strong>. But it&rsquo;s worth noticing that <strong>insist, suggest</strong> and <strong>admit</strong> are all followed by a <strong>that clause</strong> in the news report.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>For example, <strong>she suggested that it had been necessary</strong>. But we often leave the word <strong>that</strong> out &ndash; <strong>she suggested it had been necessary</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Other reporting verbs have different patterns. Some verbs are followed by a <strong>verb plus i-n-g</strong>, such as <strong>deny</strong>. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And some are followed by <strong>to plus an infinitive</strong>. You&rsquo;ll hear three example of this in our final clip.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>CLIP 3<br/></strong></span><span>When <strong>advised</strong> to reconsider her position, she had initially <strong>demanded</strong> to know why, but eventually <strong>offered</strong> to resign.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Right. We heard <strong>advised</strong>, which means <strong>told,</strong> but in a polite or indirect way.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And <strong>demanded, </strong>which means <strong>asked</strong> in a slightly aggressive way.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And finally she <strong>offered to resign</strong>. So she said that she was willing to resign if that&rsquo;s what people wanted.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Right, quiz time! Which three reporting verbs from the show today can you use instead of <strong>said</strong> in these sentences?&nbsp; Number one. I didn&rsquo;t believe her at first but she <strong>said</strong> that it was true.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>It&rsquo;s<strong> insisted. </strong>She<strong> insisted </strong>that it was true.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That&rsquo;s right. Well done! Number two: When questioned by the police, the boy <strong>said</strong> that he had stolen the car.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>So the boy <strong>admitted</strong> that he had stolen the car. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Number three: Several people have said that there&rsquo;s a possibility that the actor&rsquo;s marriage might be in trouble.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And the answer&rsquo;s<strong> suggested</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>It is! And that&rsquo;s the end of the quiz. Congratulations if you got them all right!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Well done indeed. And finally, here&rsquo;s a top tip to help you learn new words more quickly. Keep a list of reporting verbs and study their meanings. When you are writing, every time you use the words <strong>said</strong>,<strong> asked</strong> or <strong>told</strong>, check your list to see if there is a different verb that you can use in that context to add variety to your English.</span></p>

"<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Hello! Welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Finn...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And I'm Catherine. And today we're talking about words like <strong>someone</strong>,<strong> nothing </strong>and<strong> anywhere</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So, let's start by listening to Tracey. She's talking to a friend about a problem she has.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And here's a question for you: What is Tracey worried about? Here she is.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Tracey<br/></strong>My boyfriend seems to be very busy these days. I'm worried there&rsquo;s <strong>someone</strong> else in his life. I mean, most evenings he could be <strong>anywhere</strong> for all I know. He always says that he couldn't love <strong>anyone</strong> except me. And <strong>everyone</strong> knows that you should trust people you love. But do you think I should say <strong>something</strong> to him? There's <strong>no one</strong> else I can ask.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So that's Tracey. And we asked you: What is Tracey worried about?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>And the answer is: She's worried that there's <strong>someone</strong> else in her boyfriend's life.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Oh yes. Now <strong>someone</strong> is one of the words we're looking at today. <strong>Someone</strong> means <strong>one person</strong> but it doesn&rsquo;t say who.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right, Tracey doesn't know who it might be. And <strong>someone </strong>often goes with the word<strong> else</strong>.<strong> Someone else </strong>means one other person.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And Tracey used other words with <strong>one</strong> in them. Listen for them in this clip.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br/></strong>He always says that he couldn't love <strong>anyone</strong> except me. And <strong>everyone</strong> knows that you should trust people you love... There&rsquo;s <strong>no one</strong> else I can ask.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine.<br/></strong>Right, so there's <strong>anyone</strong>. That also means one person, but <strong>anyone</strong> is used mostly in questions and negative sentences.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Then there's <strong>everyone</strong>: <strong>Everyone</strong> means all people.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And <strong>no one</strong>. There's no one else I can ask. Notice the word <strong>else</strong> again,.&nbsp;<strong>No one else</strong> means <strong>no other person</strong>. You can also say <strong>anyone else. </strong>&nbsp;Or <strong>everyone else</strong>. That means <strong>all other people</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Now, in written English,<strong> someone</strong>,<strong> anyone </strong>and<strong> everyone </strong>are all one word but <strong>no one </strong>is two words: <strong>no</strong> and <strong>one.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right. And <strong>somebody</strong>,<strong> anybody</strong>,<strong> everybody</strong> and <strong>nobody</strong> are used in exactly the same way as <strong>someone</strong>, <strong>anyone</strong> and the others. But <strong>nobody</strong> is one word. So that's different from <strong>no one</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Let's have another clip.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br/></strong>But do you think I should say <strong>something</strong> to him?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So this time we heard <strong>something</strong>. And of course we can also have <strong>anything</strong>,<strong> everything </strong>and <strong>nothing</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And something means:<strong> one thing</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Anything </strong>and<strong> everything&nbsp;</strong>mean<strong> all things</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And<strong> nothing </strong>means -<strong> no thing</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK. Now let's look at the verbs we use with all these words. Tracey said: <strong>there's someone else</strong> and <strong>everyone knows</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>She did. The interesting thing here is that they're singular verbs: <strong>is</strong> and <strong>knows</strong>. We always always use a singular verb with these words. And what about the verb with <strong>no one</strong> and <strong>nothing</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Like in the sentence:<strong> There's no one else I can ask&hellip;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That's right, it's a singular verb again. We say <strong>there is</strong> not <strong>there are</strong>. And notice that it's positive. It&rsquo;s a common mistake to use a negative verb with the <strong>no</strong> words. So we don&rsquo;t say 'no one isn&rsquo;t going'.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We say <strong>no one is going</strong>. And there&rsquo;s an important point to make about <strong>everyone</strong> and <strong>everybody</strong>. Even though the verb is singular, we use <strong>they</strong>,<strong> their</strong> and <strong>them</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So: <strong>Everyone says they will come to the party</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Exactly. And it's the same with <strong>no one</strong> and <strong>nobody</strong>.<strong> Nobody wants to know their exam results</strong>! And now for the last clip.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 3<br/></strong>I mean, most evenings he could be <strong>anywhere</strong> for all I know.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now usually<strong> anywhere, anyone or anything, </strong>meanone place, person or thing. For example <strong>Is there anywhere to park the car?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>But here<strong> anywhere </strong>means<strong> in any place</strong>, <strong>it doesn't matter where exactly</strong>. And you can use <strong>anyone</strong> or <strong>anything</strong> in the same way.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So <strong>ask anyone</strong> means <strong>it doesn't matter who you ask</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And <strong>I'll eat anything</strong> means <strong>it doesn't matter what I eat</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Right, it's quiz time! Here&rsquo;s number one: Which is correct? a) Anyone knows that London is the capital of the UK. Or b) Everyone knows that London is the capital of the UK.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It's b).</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br/>That's the one! Number two: a) Are you inviting anyone other? b) Are you inviting anyone else?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It's b) again.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And now number three: a) Everyone put their coats on and left. b) Everyone put on his coat and left.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And it&rsquo;s a).</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Very good! Well done if you got all of those right.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And before we go, here's a vocabulary tip. We often use <strong>someone, anyone, everyone</strong> and <strong>no one</strong> before adjectives and infinitives. So <strong>Is there anything nice to eat</strong>? Or <strong>there&rsquo;s nothing to eat</strong>. Try making other sentences like that with these words and write them in your notebook.</p>

<p><strong>Both<br/></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Catherine.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>And I'm Finn. Actually Catherine, sorry I'm late. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>You should be.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>It's <strong>taken</strong> me forever to get here! </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>I know.</span></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong><span>The bus <strong>took</strong> hours. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Oh did it really, Finn? But you usually <strong>take</strong> the train.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>I missed it today. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>OK, no problem. Because actually, Finn, you've introduced today's topic with the words:&nbsp;<strong>take, took, taken</strong>...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Ah yes, irregular verbs.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. We're going to look at three different groups of irregular verbs. So, let's start by listening to Mike and Neil's conversation. And poor Mike can't find his phone.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Oh no. While you listen, think about this question: How many times has Abdullah rung?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Mike<br/></strong>Have you <strong>seen</strong> my phone, Neil?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I haven't <strong>taken </strong>it. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Mike<br/></strong>I didn't <strong>say</strong> you <strong>'took'</strong> it. I just <strong>said</strong> 'Have you <strong>seen</strong> it?'</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I <strong>saw</strong> it on your desk this morning.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Mike<br/></strong>I can't <strong>see</strong> it here! I've got to <strong>ring</strong> Abdullah. He <strong>rang </strong>again today. He<strong>'s rung </strong>me five times this week... &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'll ring it for you - I'll just get my phone... out... of... my pocket... Oh, this is your phone! You <strong>put </strong>it on my desk by mistake... So, where have I <strong>put</strong> my phone? I always <strong>put</strong> it in my pocket...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>So we asked you: How many times has Abdullah rung this week?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>And the answer is: five. He's <strong>rung</strong> five times this week.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Ring... rang... rung</strong>. So, the past simple of <strong>ring</strong> is <strong>rang</strong>, and the past participle is <strong>rung</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>There are several irregular verbs like <strong>ring</strong>, with different forms for the base verb, past simple and past participle.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>The verb <strong>take</strong>, for example, which we had earlier. Listen out for it in this clip.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 1<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I haven't <strong>taken </strong>it. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Mike<br/></strong>I didn't <strong>say</strong> you <strong>'took'</strong> it. I just <strong>said</strong> 'Have you <strong>seen</strong> it?'</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I <strong>saw</strong> it on your desk this morning.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Mike<br/></strong>I can't <strong>see</strong> it here!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So the verb <strong>take</strong> changes to <strong>took</strong> in the past simple...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>...and <strong>taken</strong> in the past participle.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>We also heard <strong>see, saw </strong>and<strong> seen.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>...three different forms again. <strong>See</strong> is the main verb, <strong>saw</strong> is the past simple...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>...and <strong>seen</strong> is the past participle.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>Other verbs that follow this pattern are <strong>write, wrote, written</strong>...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>...<strong>break, broke, broken</strong>...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>...<strong>speak, spoke, spoken</strong>...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>...and <strong>choose, chose, chosen</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Good. Now, in the clip we also heard <strong>say</strong> and <strong>said.</strong> The verb <strong>say </strong>belongs to a different group of irregular verbs.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, verbs in this group have just two different forms. For example, with <strong>say, said, said,</strong> the past simple and the past participle are the same.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Other verbs in this second group are: </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Tell, told, told; have</strong>, <strong>had</strong>, <strong>had; lose</strong>, <strong>lost</strong>, <strong>lost</strong>...</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>...<strong>meet, met,</strong> <strong>met; find, found, found</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Very good. Now, in the third group of irregular verbs we are looking at today, all three forms are the same. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Listen to this clip and see if you can spot an example.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<strong><br/></strong></span></strong><span><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Oh, this is your phone. You <strong>put </strong>it on my desk by mistake... So, where have I <strong>put</strong> my phone? I always <strong>put</strong> it in my pocket...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So, we had <strong>put, put, put -</strong> all three forms are exactly the same.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Other verbs in this group include <strong>cut, cut, cut; let, let, let</strong> and <strong>shut, shut, shut</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>You&rsquo;re listening to bbclearningenglish.com </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And we're talking about three different groups of irregular verbs. In one group, the verb is the same in all three forms, like <strong>put</strong>, <strong>put</strong>,<strong> put</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>In another group the verb is the same in two of its forms, like <strong>say, said, said</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>...and in the third, and biggest group, all three forms are different, like <strong>take, took, taken</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And now, it's quiz time! Question one. What are the three forms of the verb <strong>shut</strong> &ndash; as in <strong>shut the door</strong>?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And the answer is<strong> shut, shut, shut.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. Number two. What are the three forms of the verb <strong>find</strong> - as in <strong>find some money</strong>?&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And the answer is<strong> find, found, found</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And number three: Which of these verbs is different in all three forms: a) <strong>have</strong>, b) <strong>choose</strong> or c) <strong>let</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></span></strong>And the answer is b) choose, chose, chosen. The others are a) <strong>have, had, had</strong> and c) is <strong>let, let, let</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>And that's the end of the quiz, quiz, quiz. Well done if you got them right.</span></p>

"<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><span> &nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Neil...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>A very smart Neil - and I'm Catherine. Why are you wearing a suit, Neil? You're looking very smart for work.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes you're right, I am wearing a suit because I'm going to a wedding<strong> at one o'clock</strong>!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Very good! I love weddings.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I love weddings too. I'm going to another one <strong>on Saturday</strong>! </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Fantastic Neil. And<strong> at </strong>and <strong>on</strong> are two of the words we&rsquo;re discussing in today's programme...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, because we're talking about time expressions with <strong>in, on</strong> and <strong>at</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>We'll explain why we say <strong><span>at</span></strong> <strong>one o'clock </strong>but <strong><span>on</span> Saturday.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>Yes, and we'll give you lots of examples.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>Let's start by listening to Mike and Rob. They are trying to find a time to meet up.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Think about this question while you listen: what time can Rob meet Mike?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>INSERT</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Mike<br/></strong></span><span>How about lunch <strong>on Monday, Rob?</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well... I've got a meeting <strong>at 11.30. </strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Mike</strong><br/>Ok, are you free <strong>on Tuesday</strong>?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Hmm... the engineer's coming <strong>at lunchtime</strong>. The washing machine's flooded <span>again!</span> It happened <strong>at Easter</strong>, too.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Mike</strong><br/>Well, what are you doing <strong>in the afternoon?</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Sorry - I'm playing football.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Mike</strong><br/>Ok - perhaps we could meet in the pub<strong> on Saturday evening?</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob</strong><br/>We've got guests<strong> at the weekend. </strong>How about this afternoon <strong>at two thirty</strong>?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>So, we asked you: What time can Rob meet Mike? </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><br/><span>And the answer is: <strong>at two thirty.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>When we say a particular time on the clock, we use <strong>at</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So, we say <strong>at two thirty, at three o'clock.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>We also use <strong>at</strong> in other time expressions. Listen out for them in this clip.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span><strong>INSERT CLIP 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Mike</strong><br/>How about lunch <strong>on Monday, Rob?</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Well&hellip; I've got a meeting <strong>at 11.30. </strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Mike</strong><br/>Ok, are you free <strong>on Tuesday</strong>?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Hmm&hellip; The engineer's coming <strong>at lunchtime</strong>. The washing machine's flooded <span>again!</span> It happened <strong>at Easter</strong>, too.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>So Rob had a meeting <strong>at 11.30. </strong>It's<strong> at </strong>because it&rsquo;s a time<strong>. </strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. We also heard <strong>at lunchtime</strong>. We use <strong>at</strong> with particular points during the day, like mealtimes, so it's <strong>at breakfast, at lunch, at dinner</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>&hellip;and also we say <strong>at noon</strong>,<strong> at midnight</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Now Rob said his washing machine flooded <strong>at Easter</strong>. We use <strong>at</strong> to talk about a special day or group of days. So, it&rsquo;s<strong> at Easter, at New Year.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>At Christmas. So that's <strong>at</strong>. Let&rsquo;s look at <strong>on</strong>. We use <strong>on</strong> with days of the week. So: <strong>on Monday,</strong> <strong>on Tuesday</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>We also use <strong>on</strong> with specific dates: <strong>on the third of May, on June the 20th</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>&hellip;and we use <strong>on</strong> with specific days: <strong>on Christmas Day, on Easter Sunday, on my birthday</strong>!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. But remember it's<strong> <span>at</span> Easter, <span>at</span> Christmas </strong>when we are referring to the general time period.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Let's listen to another clip with more time expressions. Listen out for the time expression with <strong>in</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 2</span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Mike</strong><br/>What are you doing <strong>in the afternoon?</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Sorry - I'm playing football.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Mike</strong><br/>Ok - perhaps we could meet in the pub<strong> on Saturday evening?</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob</strong><br/>We've got guests<strong> at the weekend. </strong>How about this afternoon<strong> at two thirty?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So we had <strong>in the afternoon</strong>. We use <strong>in</strong> with parts of the day, so it's <strong>in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening. </strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>But did you notice that it's<strong> on Saturday evening. </strong>If we use a day of the week plus <strong>morning, afternoon</strong> or <strong>evening, </strong>we use <strong>on</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>We also use <strong>in</strong> with seasons, so it's<strong> in spring, in the winter. </strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>We use <strong>in</strong> with months and years, so it's <strong>in June, in 1996.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil <br/></span></strong><span>Notice also that Rob said <strong>at the weekend</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Rob speaks British English so he used <strong>at the weekend</strong>. Some other speakers will say <strong>on the weekend</strong>. It's perfectly fine.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from the BBC. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>And we're talking about time expressions with <strong>in, on</strong> and <strong>at</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So, to recap, we use <strong>on</strong> with days of the week, dates and special days.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>We use<strong> at </strong>with times and particular points in the day.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>British people say <strong>at the weekend. </strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And we also say <strong>at</strong> with festivals<strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>We use <strong>in</strong> for seasons, months and years. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>And now for a quiz. Fill the gaps with <strong>in, on</strong> or <strong>at</strong>. Ready? Number one. What do you usually do [sfx: beep] the weekend?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>And the answer is <strong>at</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>Good. Number two. Don't be late! The film starts [sfx: beep] nine. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>And the answer is <strong>at</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></span><span>And the last one. There are usually fireworks in London [sfx: beep] New Year's Eve.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And the answer is <strong>on</strong>. Well done if you got them all right. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Now for today's top tip for learning vocabulary: Instead of learning individual new words, try learning small chunks of language like time phrases. They will be easier to learn and they make your English sound more natural.</span></p>

"<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Hello! Welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Neil.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And I'm Catherine. In this show we're talking about uncountable nouns.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, we are. So that's nouns that you can&rsquo;t count, like <strong>water</strong>, <strong>money</strong> and <strong>research</strong>. We'll show you plenty of examples...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>...and we'll also bring you a top tip for recognising uncountable nouns.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>But let's start by listening to Colin. He's a travel agent.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>While you listen, think about this question: what might you need from your bank before you go abroad? Here's Colin.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Colin<br/></strong></span><span>It's time to start planning your summer <strong>travel</strong>! Do some <strong>research</strong> before you go. Are there good reviews of the <strong>accommodation</strong>? How much <strong>baggage</strong> can you take and what's the best way to take <strong>money </strong>abroad? Do you need to get some <strong>advice</strong> from your bank? Will the <strong>traffic</strong> be bad on the way to the airport? </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So that was Colin. We asked you: What might you need from your bank before you go abroad?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>And the answer is: You might need some <strong>advice</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That's right: <strong>some advice</strong>.<strong> Advice</strong> means ideas and suggestions about what to do. Now, did you notice that <strong>advice </strong>is not plural? We never say <strong>advices</strong> in English because <strong>advice</strong> is an uncountable noun. You can't make <strong>advice</strong> plural, like you can in some other languages.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And with uncountable nouns, we don't use articles <strong>a</strong> or <strong>an</strong>. We say <strong>some advice</strong>, not<strong> an advice</strong>. Now listen out for three more uncountable nouns in this clip.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Colin<br/></strong></span>It's time to start planning your summer <strong>travel</strong>! Do some <strong>research</strong> before you go. Are there good reviews of the <strong>accommodation</strong>?</p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the uncountable nouns in that clip were: <strong>travel, research</strong> and <strong>accommodation</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And activities like <strong>travel, work</strong> and <strong>homework</strong> are usually uncountable.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Information words like <strong>research</strong>,<strong> information</strong> and <strong>advice</strong> are uncountable too. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, they're not usually plural in English, but we can add the words <strong>a piece of </strong>to lots of uncountable nouns if we like. So we can say <strong>a piece of information </strong>or<strong> two pieces of advice. &nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. The other uncountable noun in that clip was <strong>accommodation</strong>.<strong> Accommodation </strong>means 'places to live or spend the night', like rooms, flats and houses. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So <strong>accommodation</strong> describes the groups of places that you can stay like flats, houses, students halls of residence. And group words are often uncountable, so there's no plural form. <strong>Fruit</strong>,<strong> food</strong> and <strong>weather</strong> are group words too. We don't usually say <strong>fruits</strong>, <strong>foods</strong> and <strong>weathers</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><strong><br/></strong><span>That's right. Now, let's have another clip. Can you spot any more uncountable nouns?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br/></strong></span><span>How much <strong>baggage</strong> can you take and what's the best way to take <strong>money </strong>abroad? Will the <strong>traffic</strong> be bad on the way to the airport?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And we had <strong>baggage</strong>,<strong> money </strong>and<strong> traffic</strong>. In some languages these words are often plural...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>...but not in English. In English, they are all group words.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. So<strong> baggage </strong>means a group of bags...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>It's<strong> money </strong>for coins or notes...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And <strong>traffic</strong> for cars, lorries, buses.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>STING</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And we're talking about uncountable nouns. We've seen that some activity nouns are uncountable, and some group nouns are uncountable. Shall we now talk about more types of uncountable nouns, Catherine?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Go on then. So we've got liquids and gases. <strong>Water</strong> and <strong>air </strong>are uncountable.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, they are. Materials and substances like <strong>wood </strong>and <strong>salt</strong> are uncountable too.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Then there are words for feelings and ideas, so <strong>happiness</strong> and <strong>education</strong>...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And also subjects like <strong>history</strong> and <strong>biology</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. But be careful with subjects like <strong>physics</strong> or <strong>economics</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, they end with the letter <strong>-s,</strong> so they look plural, but in fact they're usually uncountable too. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>So we use them with a singular verb, just like other uncountable nouns. Physics <strong>is</strong> complicated...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><br/><span>...and Economics <strong>isn't</strong> easy.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/><strong>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And it's quiz time!&nbsp;Number one: Is the word <strong>furniture</strong> countable or uncountable?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And the answer is - it's uncountable. It's a group word like <strong>baggage</strong>. It means things like tables and chairs.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>Very good. And number two: is this sentence correct or wrong? Please can you give me some informations?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><br/><span>That is not correct. <strong>Information</strong> is uncountable so it's <strong>some information</strong> without an -<strong>s</strong>, not <strong>some informations</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine.<br/></span></strong><span>Very good! And the last one: Which is correct: a) it was beautiful weather on Saturday. Or b) it was a beautiful weather on Saturday.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>The answer's a) it was beautiful weather on Saturday. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And that's the end of the quiz. Well done to you if you got them all right. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>But before we go, here's a tip. When you see a noun, think carefully about whether it belongs to one of these types: activity words, information words or group words. If it does, then it's probably uncountable.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Both<br/></span></strong><span>Bye!</span></p><br>
<h3><strong>Vocabulary points to take away</strong></h3><p>Uncountable nouns have no plural form and are not used with the indefinite article <strong>a</strong> or <strong>an</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Can you give me <strong>some information</strong> about <strong>accommodation</strong> in the city?</em></p>
<p>There are three main types of uncountable nouns that students often think are countable:</p><ul><li>activity nouns: <strong>travel, work, homework</strong></li><li>information nouns: <strong>advice, information, knowledge, research</strong></li><li>group nouns: <strong>accommodation, baggage, furniture, money, traffic, weather</strong></li></ul><p>Other nouns that are uncountable are<strong>:</strong></p><ul><li>liquids and gasses:<strong> water, air</strong></li><li>materials and substances:<strong> wood, rice</strong></li><li>feelings and ideas:<strong> happiness, education</strong></li><li>subjects:<strong> geography, history, economics</strong></li></ul><p>A few uncountable nouns look plural because they end in <strong>-s</strong>.

"<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me Finn&hellip;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And me Catherine. Today we&rsquo;re talking about short spoken forms. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>That's words like <strong>gonna</strong>, <strong>wanna</strong> and <strong>gotta</strong> that we use a lot in spoken English. Let&rsquo;s start by listening to Jason and Yuki talking about their plans for the weekend.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And here&rsquo;s a question: Who&rsquo;s Yuki meeting on Saturday night? Have a listen.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Jason<br/></strong><strong>Whatcha </strong>doing at the weekend, Yuki?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Yuki<br/></span></strong><span>I<strong> dunno. </strong>I&rsquo;m probably<strong> gonna </strong>meet Lucy on Saturday night.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Jason<br/></span></strong><span>Oh, right. Do you<strong> wanna </strong>come to the cinema in the afternoon?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Yuki<br/></span></strong><span>No, thanks. I&rsquo;ve<strong> gotta </strong>finish an English essay for Monday morning.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Jason<br/></span></strong><span>OK. <strong>Lemme</strong> know if you change your mind. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>STING</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well that was Jason and Yuki. We asked you: Who&rsquo;s Yuki meeting on Saturday night?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></span></strong><span>And the answer is: she&rsquo;s probably going to meet Lucy.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong></span><span>That&rsquo;s right. But instead of saying <strong>going to</strong>, Yuki said <strong>gonna</strong>. <strong>She&rsquo;s probably gonna meet Lucy</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re looking at in this programme. English speakers often say the words<strong> going to </strong>very fast &ndash; and it sounds like<strong> gonna. </strong>They usually do this in informal situations when they&rsquo;re talking to friends.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So does that mean that you shouldn&rsquo;t say <strong>gonna</strong> when you need to speak carefully and politely, like in a job interview?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Well, not necessarily. If <strong>gonna</strong> comes out naturally, it&rsquo;s probably ok. But a job interview is formal, so it&rsquo;s probably&nbsp;a bit more polite to say <strong>going to</strong>. And you don&rsquo;t usually use <strong>gonna</strong> in writing, unless you&rsquo;re actually writing down a dialogue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>In fact some people never use it, even informally. Although it&rsquo;s probably more common in American English.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. And one other thing about <strong>gonna</strong> is that we only use it to replace <strong>going to</strong> when it&rsquo;s followed by a verb.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>That's true. If you say: <strong>I&rsquo;m going to Paris</strong>, you can&rsquo;t use <strong>gonna</strong> to say: I&rsquo;m <strong>gonna</strong> Paris. You&rsquo;d have to add a verb, like this, and say: <strong>I&rsquo;m gonna go to Paris</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span><strong>I'm gonna go to Paris</strong>. Let&rsquo;s have another clip with some more short spoken forms.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Jason<br/>Whatcha </strong>doing at the weekend, Yuki?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Yuki<br/></strong></span><span>I<strong> dunno. </strong>I&rsquo;m probably<strong> gonna </strong>meet Lucy on Saturday night.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So Jason said <strong>whatcha</strong>. <strong>Whatcha</strong>. That&rsquo;s a short form of <strong>what are you</strong>. Or sometimes <strong>what do you</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And Yuki said <strong>I dunno</strong>. <strong>I dunno</strong>. That&rsquo;s a short spoken form of <strong>I don&rsquo;t know</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Let&rsquo;s have another clip. See if you can spot any more.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br/></strong></span><span><strong>Jason<br/></strong></span><span>Oh, right. Do you<strong> wanna </strong>come to the cinema in the afternoon?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Yuki<br/></strong></span><span>No, thanks. I&rsquo;ve<strong> gotta </strong>finish an English essay for Monday morning.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Did you get them? We heard <strong>wanna</strong>. That&rsquo;s a short form of <strong>want to</strong>. <strong>Do you wanna come to the cinema in the afternoon</strong>? </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And there was also <strong>gotta</strong>. <strong>Gotta</strong>.<strong> I&rsquo;ve</strong><strong> gotta finish an English essay</strong>. Here, <strong>gotta</strong> is short for <strong>got to</strong>. But <strong>gotta</strong> can also be short for the possessive <strong>got a</strong>, like in <strong>I&rsquo;ve gotta new mobile</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And now for the last clip.</span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong>INSERT CLIP 3<br/></strong></span><span><strong>Jason<br/></strong></span><span>OK. <strong>Lemme</strong> know if you change your mind.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Can you guess what <strong>lemme</strong> is short for? It&rsquo;s <strong>let me. Let me know if you change your mind.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. And there are others like <strong>hafta</strong>,<strong> hafta</strong>, for <strong>have to</strong> or <strong>gimme</strong>, that's <strong>gimme</strong>, for <strong>give me</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Now what about <strong>kinda</strong>, <strong>kinda</strong>, for <strong>kind of</strong>? Like <strong>She&rsquo;s kinda nice</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And we&rsquo;re talking about spoken short forms. So Catherine, <strong>whatcha gonna</strong> do in the quiz?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Let's go. Quiz question number one: what&rsquo;s a more informal way to say <strong>I&rsquo;ve got to phone the bank</strong>?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>It&rsquo;s <strong>I&rsquo;ve gotta phone the bank</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Good. And number two: you want to know what your friend is doing tonight. How can you ask them, using a spoken short form?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>You could say: <strong>whatcha doing tonight</strong>?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And number three: you think it&rsquo;s going to rain. Tell your friend using a spoken short form.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>You could say:<strong> I think it&rsquo;s gonna rain</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And that&rsquo;s the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them all right. Now before we go, here&rsquo;s a vocabulary tip. Try to watch TV, movies and video clips regularly in English. Listen out for short spoken forms and practise repeating them. It will help you to understand better when you listen and sound more natural when you speak.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>There&rsquo;s more about this at </span><a href=""http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/""><span>bbclearningenglish.com</span></a><span>. We&rsquo;ve <strong>gotta</strong> go now, but do join us again soon for more 6 Minute Vocabulary. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Both<br/></span></strong><span>Bye!</span></p><br>
<h3>Vocabulary points to take away</h3><p>Spoken short forms are ways of saying phrases quickly in informal situations. Some common examples are:</p>
<p><strong>gonna - going to</strong><br/><em>I'm gonna watch a DVD.</em></p>
<p><strong>wanna - want to<br/></strong><em>Do you wanna watch too?</em></p>
<p><strong>whatcha - what are you</strong><br/><em>Whatcha doing?</em></p>
<p><strong>dunno - don&rsquo;t know</strong><br/><em>I dunno.</em></p>
<p><strong>gotta - got to (or got a)</strong><br/><em>I've gotta go now.</em></p>
<p><strong>hafta - have to</strong><br/><em>Do you hafta go already?</em></p>
<p><strong>gimme - give me</strong><br/><em>Gimme a call tomorrow.</em></p>
<p><strong>lemme - let me</strong><br/><em>Lemme know what you think.</em></p>
<p><strong>kinda - kind of</strong><br/><em>She's kinda nice.</em></p>"
"<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me, Catherine.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And me, Neil. And today we're talking about ordinal numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes. So numbers like <strong>first, second </strong>and <strong>third</strong>. So let's start by listening to Laurence. He's talking about his 18th birthday party. While you listen, try to answer this question: What date was his party? Here's Laurence.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Laurence<br/></strong>For my <strong>18th </strong>birthday last year, I invited about sixty friends and relatives! It was on <strong>the twenty-fifth of</strong> May and it was <strong>the first</strong> time that I've ever had a big party. It was in a restaurant on <strong>the third</strong> floor of a hotel. The food was really delicious and I won <strong>second</strong> prize in the dancing competition!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So we asked you: What date was Laurence's birthday party?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the answer is: <strong>the twenty-fifth of</strong> May.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's right. Now <strong>the twenty-fifth</strong> is an ordinal number like <strong>the</strong> <strong>first</strong> and <strong>the</strong> <strong>second</strong>. Ordinal numbers tell us the position of something in a group - the dates in a month, for example.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Or which birthday it is. Laurence said it was his <strong>eighteenth</strong> birthday.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, he did. Lucky him! And ordinal numbers are different to cardinal numbers. We use cardinal numbers like <strong>one</strong>, <strong>two</strong>, <strong>three</strong> for counting and to answer the question <strong>how many</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And to make a cardinal number into an ordinal number, add the letters <strong>t-h</strong> to the end of the cardinal number. <strong>Eighteen - eighteenth; sixty - sixtieth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And that works for all the cardinal numbers except for <strong>first, second </strong>and<strong> third</strong> &ndash; they're irregular, but for all the others, it's add <strong>t-h, </strong>so that's<strong> fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh&hellip;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Eighth, ninth, tenth</strong>. So that's good but in writing we do have a couple of irregular spellings, such as <strong>fifth:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>f-i-f-t-h</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>eighth</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>e-i-g-h-t-h</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>ninth</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>n-i-n-t-h</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>twelfth</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>t-w-e-l-f-t-h</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And for numbers ending in<strong> -y </strong>like <strong>sixty</strong>, drop the <strong>-y</strong> and add <strong>-i-e </strong>and<strong> -t-h </strong>to make<strong> sixtieth:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>s-i-x-t-i-e-t-h</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now let's look more closely at dates. Listen for the date in this clip.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br/></strong>It was on <strong>the twenty-fifth of</strong> May and it was <strong>the first</strong> time that I've ever had a big party.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>The twenty-fifth of May</strong>. When we say the day before the month, we always use the words <strong>the</strong> and <strong>of</strong>: <strong>the twenty-fifth of May</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>But when we say the month before the day, we don't use the word <strong>of</strong>. It's just <strong>May the twenty-fifth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We often use the word <strong>the </strong>with ordinal numbers, but we can also use possessives. In this next clip, Laurence uses the possessive adjective <strong>my</strong> before <strong>eighteenth</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br/></strong>For my <strong>18th </strong>birthday last year, I invited about sixty friends and relatives!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Let's have another clip.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 3<br/></strong>It was in a restaurant on <strong>the third</strong> floor of a hotel. The food was really delicious and I won <strong>second</strong> prize in the dancing competition!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So, now we have two more ways of using ordinal numbers: space and quality.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, we do. And <strong>the third floor</strong> tells us about the position of the floors in space. It's the same as when we give directions, for example: <strong>Take the second left after the traffic lights.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And <strong>second prize</strong> tells us about the quality. And a point to make here is that ordinal numbers can be used as adjectives and adverbs without <strong>the. </strong>Like in the phrase <strong>he won second prize. Second </strong>is an adjective.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And now it's quiz time! Number one: Which of these is correct? The party's on: a) thirtieth of July b) the thirtieth July c) the thirtieth of July.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And it's c) the thirtieth of July.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Great! Now, number two. Which word in this list is wrong? First, second, third, ford, fifth.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>The answer's <strong>ford</strong>. It should be <strong>fourth</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, it should! Number three: Which of these is correct? a) My twenty-first birthday b) My the twenty-first birthday c) The my twenty-first birthday.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>The answer's a) My twenty-first birthday.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well done if you got them right. But before we go, here's a vocabulary tip. Try saying your own important and memorable dates in English, for example, birthdays, anniversaries and festivals. If the dates are important, you're more likely to remember the English.</p>

<p><strong>Both<br/></strong>Bye!</p><br>
<h3><strong>Summary&nbsp;- m</strong>eaning and use</h3><p>Ordinal numbers tell us the position of something in a group. They are used for:</p>
<p><strong>1. Dates</strong><br/><em>It's&nbsp;<strong>the twelfth of November</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>2. The order of events</strong><br/><em>Her&nbsp;<strong>fiftieth birthday</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>3. Position in space</strong><br/><em>Our apartment's&nbsp;<strong>on the first floor</strong></em><br/><em>It's the&nbsp;<strong>third on the right</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>4. Order of quality</strong><br/><em>The&nbsp;<strong>first prize</strong>&nbsp;in the competition</em></p>
<h3>Spelling and form</h3><p>We usually form ordinal numbers by adding -<strong>th</strong>&nbsp;to cardinal numbers:<br/><strong>four - fourth<br/></strong><strong>first, second</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>third</strong>&nbsp;are irregular forms<br/><strong>fifth, eighth, ninth, twelfth&nbsp;</strong>and numbers ending in<strong>&nbsp;-y&nbsp;</strong>have irregular spellings:&nbsp;<strong>twentieth</strong></p>
<p>We say dates with&nbsp;<strong>the</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>of</strong>:<br/><strong><em>the eighth of</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Apr</em><em>il</em><br/><em>April&nbsp;<strong>the eighth&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p>But we don't write them like that. We write them as:<br/><strong><em>8th April</em></strong><br/><strong><em>April 8th</em></strong><br/><strong><em>8 April</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>First, second</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>third</strong>&nbsp;have the irregular suffixes&nbsp;<strong>1st, 2nd&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;3rd</strong></p>
<p>We usually use the definite article&nbsp;<strong>the</strong>&nbsp;with ordinal numbers:<strong><br/></strong><em>on&nbsp;<strong>the third</strong>&nbsp;day</em><br/><em>It was&nbsp;<strong>the first</strong>&nbsp;time I've ever been to France</em></p>
<p>But sometimes we use possessives:<br/><em><strong>my thirtieth</strong>&nbsp;birthday</em><br/><em><strong>Julia's second</strong>&nbsp;child</em></p>
<p>Ordinal numbers are also used as adjectives and adverbs without&nbsp;<strong>the</strong>&nbsp;or a possessive adjective.</p>"
"<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><span> &nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I&rsquo;m Neil&hellip;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>And I&rsquo;m Finn. In this programme we&rsquo;re looking at three prefixes: <strong>de-</strong>, spelt <strong>d-e</strong>, <strong>dys-</strong>, spelt <strong>d-y-s </strong>and <strong>dis-</strong>,spelt <strong>d-i-s</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Prefixes &ndash; or prefixes, as some people say - are two or three letters that go at the beginning of a word and affect its meaning.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>We&rsquo;ll look at what each prefix means and give you example sentences&hellip;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>There&rsquo;ll be a quiz &hellip;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>&hellip;and we&rsquo;ll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>But first, let&rsquo;s listen to Gladys talking about her husband Bert.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>While you listen, think about this question: Does Gladys agree with Bert&rsquo;s doctor?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><strong><span>Gladys<br/></span></strong><span>Bert&rsquo;s <strong>dyspepsia</strong>, or indigestion, is quite bad at the moment. It&rsquo;s causing him quite a bit of <strong>discomfort</strong>. The doctor says it&rsquo;s because he eats too much fatty food. She says the symptoms would <strong>disappear</strong> if Bert went on a <strong>detox</strong> diet. No <strong>disrespect </strong>to the doctor, but I <strong>disagree</strong> - I think it&rsquo;s caused by stress. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><br/><span>So we asked you: Does Gladys agree with the doctor?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>And the answer is: No, she <strong>disagrees. </strong>Gladys thinks her husband&rsquo;s indigestion is caused by stress, but the doctor thinks it&rsquo;s due to a bad diet.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Disagree</strong> is the key word because it has the prefix <strong>dis</strong>, spelt <strong>d-i-s</strong>. This means not. So by adding <strong>dis,</strong> we can turn a word into its opposite. So <strong>dis - agree</strong> means not to agree &hellip;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>&hellip;and <strong>dis - respect</strong> means not having respect.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Gladys says <strong>No disrespect to the doctor </strong>&ndash; meaning she doesn&rsquo;t want people to think she doesn&rsquo;t respect what the doctor says<strong>.</strong> Let&rsquo;s hear another clip from Gladys with more prefixes.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 1<br/></span></strong><span>Bert&rsquo;s <strong>dyspepsia</strong>, or indigestion, is quite bad at the moment. It&rsquo;s causing him quite a bit of <strong>discomfort</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So we had <strong>discomfort. </strong>If you know what the word <strong>comfort</strong> means&hellip;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>&hellip; then you can work out what <strong>discomfort </strong>means: <strong>dis-</strong> plus <strong>comfort</strong> &nbsp;give us the opposite of comfort: Bert&rsquo;s feeling uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And in the clip, we heard the word <strong>dyspepsia</strong> &ndash; that&rsquo;s the medical word for indigestion, when your stomach feels very full and uncomfortable after you eat.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>This word starts with the prefix <strong>dys</strong>, but this time it&rsquo;s spelt <strong>d-y-s</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>This prefix is less common than <strong>dis</strong>,spelt<strong> d-i-s</strong>, but it also has a negative meaning &ndash; it has the idea of being bad or abnormal.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So <strong>dyspepsia </strong>is a medical condition when your body can&rsquo;t process food in the normal way.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Other words with the prefix <strong>dys-</strong> , spelt <strong>d-y-s</strong>, are <strong>dyslexia </strong>and <strong>dysfunctional. </strong>People who have <strong>dyslexia</strong> have difficulty with reading&hellip;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>&hellip; and if something is <strong>dysfunctional</strong>, it doesn&rsquo;t work properly.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Let&rsquo;s have another clip with the prefix <strong>dis-</strong>, <strong>d-i-s</strong>. We&rsquo;ll also hear our next prefix.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 2<br/></span></strong><span>She says the symptoms would <strong>disappear</strong> if Bert went on a <strong>detox</strong> diet. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So, we had <strong>disappear</strong> - that&rsquo;s <strong>dis-</strong> plus <strong>appear</strong>&hellip;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, and <strong>disappear</strong>, means the opposite of <strong>appear.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>We also had the word <strong>detox</strong>, which starts with the prefix <strong>de-</strong>, spelt <strong>d-e</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, the prefix <strong>de-</strong>,spelt<strong> d-e</strong>, usually means take away or remove something &hellip;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So, if something is described as a <strong>detox</strong>, <strong>de-tox</strong>, it means it takes away toxins or poisons. A <strong>detox</strong> diet could be one with just fruit and vegetables.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I like to <strong>detox</strong> at the end of the day with a hot bath.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from the BBC.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And we&rsquo;re talking about the prefixes<strong> dis-</strong>,spelt<strong> d-i-s</strong>;<strong> dys</strong>,spelt <strong>d-y-s</strong>; and<strong> de-</strong>, spelt <strong>d-e</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>All these prefixes have a negative meaning.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And now it&rsquo;s quiz time. Choose the correct word. Number one: One minute the dogs were playing in the garden. The next minute the garden was empty and they&rsquo;d all a) disagreed b) disappeared c) detoxed.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Well, the answer to that is b) <strong>disappeared</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Number two. People who drink too much alcohol sometimes go to a clinic for a a) dyspepsia b) discomfort c) detox.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>The answer is c) <strong>detox</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And number three: My daughter is having problems learning to read. Her teacher thinks she may be a) disrespectful b) dyslexic c) dysfunctional.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br/><span>The answer is b) <strong>dyslexic</strong>. And that&rsquo;s the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them right.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><br/><span>Yes, well done. And now, here&rsquo;s our top tip for learning vocabulary: when you see or hear a new word, see if you can break the word up - if it starts with a prefix that you recognise, it may help you to understand the meaning.&nbsp; </span></p>

"<p><strong>Catherine</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp; <br/> Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Catherine...</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> And I'm Neil. Today we're looking at the suffixes <strong>-</strong><strong>less </strong>and<strong> -</strong><strong>free.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Suffixes are two or three letters at the end of a word that affect its meaning.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We'll look at what the suffixes <strong>-free</strong> and <strong>-less</strong> mean and give you some examples...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>There'll be a quiz...</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>...and we'll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Let's start by listening to Markus. He's a politician and he's talking about his party's policies.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Right. So while you listen, think about this question: Do e-cigarettes produce smoke? Here's Markus.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT</strong><br/><strong>Markus<br/></strong>We're focusing on the <strong>jobless</strong>, the <strong>homeless</strong>, the sick and the elderly - people who are <strong>powerless</strong> to change things for themselves. We're campaigning for more <strong>car-free</strong> and <strong>smoke-free</strong> zones. We're going to extend the smoking ban to include e-cigarettes, which may be <strong>smokeless</strong>, but they aren't <strong>harmless</strong>, and we're going to raise the penalties for <strong>careless</strong> drivers.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/> So we asked you: Do e-cigarettes produce smoke?</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> And the answer is: No they don't. E-cigarettes are <strong>smokeless</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And<strong> smokeless </strong>is a key word in this programme because it ends with the suffix<strong> less, </strong>spelt<strong> l-e-s-s. </strong>This means 'without'.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So <strong>smokeless</strong> cigarettes are cigarettes without smoke - they don't produce any smoke.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And if something is <strong>harmless</strong>, it doesn't cause harm. Markus said that e-cigarettes are not <strong>harmless</strong>. In other words, they are dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Markus also said his party was going to raise penalties - or increase punishments - for <strong>careless </strong>drivers - people who drive without care.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, <strong>careless </strong>means not being careful.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So, by adding <strong>-less</strong> to the nouns <strong>smoke, harm </strong>and<strong> care,</strong> we turn them into adjectives. Let's hear some more examples with <strong>-less</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Markus<br/></strong>We're focusing on the <strong>jobless</strong>, the <strong>homeless</strong>, the sick and the elderly - people who are <strong>powerless</strong> to change things for themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So we had the <strong>jobless</strong>...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's people without jobs...</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>...the <strong>homeless</strong>...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>...people who have nowhere to live. We can create a noun to describe a particular group of people, by using the word <strong>the</strong> with a <strong>&shy;-less</strong> word. <strong>The jobless</strong>, <strong>the homeless</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Lastly, we had the adjective<strong> powerless, </strong>which describes people who are unable to do certain things. If we add <strong>the</strong>, we get a group noun: <strong>the powerless</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Let's have another clip. Listen out for the suffix <strong>-free.</strong></p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Markus<br/></strong>We're campaigning for more <strong>car-free</strong> and <strong>smoke-free</strong> zones.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We had <strong>car-free</strong> and <strong>smoke-free</strong>. Now if you add <strong>-free</strong> to a noun, you get an adjective, meaning that there isn't any of that noun, or it's not allowed, or both. <strong>Car-free </strong>means there are no cars because they're not allowed. <strong>Smoke-free</strong> means smoking is not allowed and so there is no smoke.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/> 6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And we're talking about the suffixes <strong>-</strong><strong>free </strong>and <strong>-</strong><strong>less</strong>. And Neil how was your journey to work today; <strong>stress-free</strong>, I hope?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, actually, it was awful! I tried to use my <strong>contactless </strong>credit card to pay for the train, but it didn't work, so I had to walk all the way...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Oh, won't do you any harm, Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No. It's good for me, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It is. And <strong>contactless</strong> credit cards are the cards that work without a PIN number.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Usually you use either <strong>-</strong><strong>free</strong> or <strong>-</strong><strong>less</strong> with a particular word. But occasionally you can use&nbsp;<strong>-free</strong> and <strong>-</strong><strong>less</strong> interchangeably, as in <strong>sugarless</strong> and <strong>sugar-free. </strong>These both mean: without sugar.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>But be very careful with the words <strong>careless</strong> and <strong>carefree </strong>because they have very different meanings.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, they do. A<strong> careless </strong>person is someone who doesn't take much care over what they're doing...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>...whereas a<strong> carefree </strong>person like you, Neil, doesn't worry about anything.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, I don't worry about a thing.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now, it's time for a quiz. Choose the correct word. Ready? Number one: Jack looks scary, but he's actually very kind and gentle. He's a) careless b) harmless c) powerless.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And the answer is b) <strong>harmless</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Number two. Dalya doesn't check her work properly so she makes lots of mistakes. She's very a) careless&nbsp; b) carefree&nbsp; c) contactless.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And the answer is a)<strong> careless</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Number three: To cut the risk of cancer, some people smoke e-cigarettes which are a) smokeless b) smokeless-free c) smoke-free.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And the answer is a) <strong>smokeless.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/> And that's the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them right.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> And now, here's today's top tip for learning vocabulary: record yourself saying new words and then listen to them every day.&nbsp;</p>

"<p><strong>Catherine</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/> Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Catherine&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Neil, like your hat!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Thank you very much. It's cold outside, so I thought it would be <strong>sensible </strong>to wear a woolly hat.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>My ears are very <strong>sensitive</strong> to the cold.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I've noticed your ears looking a little bit red of a morning, occasionally, Neil. And the words <strong>sensible</strong> and <strong>sensitive </strong>are good examples of today's topic. The two words look and sound similar, but they have very different meanings. And in this programme we're going to talk about more pairs of words that people sometimes get mixed up.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now let's now hear about Mike. He was in a shop yesterday when he made a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Think about this question while you listen: What mistake did Mike make in the shop?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong>Mike felt <strong>bored</strong>. He was watching a <strong>boring</strong> film about plants in the <strong>desert</strong>. 'I know &ndash; I'll make a cake', he thought. 'We'll have it for <strong>dessert</strong>'. The <strong>recipe</strong> looked easy &ndash; just a few <strong>ingredients</strong>. But when Mike checked the <strong>contents</strong> of his cupboard, there wasn't any sugar. He went to the shop and bought some. The cake looked great. But it tasted horrible. Mike checked the <strong>receipt</strong>. He'd bought salt by mistake!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So we asked you: What mistake did Mike make in the shop?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And the answer is: He bought salt instead of sugar.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, the <strong>receipt</strong> said 'salt' but the <strong>recipe, </strong>of course, said 'sugar'.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>The nouns <strong>receipt </strong>and <strong>recipe </strong>look very similar, but they have different meanings. A <strong>receipt</strong>, r &ndash; e &ndash; c &ndash; e &ndash; i &ndash; p &ndash; t, is a document that shows you have paid money for something.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, and a <strong>recipe</strong>, r &ndash; e &ndash; c &ndash; i &ndash; p &ndash; e, is a set of cooking instructions.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Listen to a clip from Mike's story. Can you spot two more confusing words?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br/></strong>He was watching a boring film about plants in the <strong>desert</strong>. 'I know &ndash; I'll make a cake', he thought. 'We'll have it for <strong>dessert</strong>'.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So that's<strong> desert</strong> and <strong>dessert</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yep. Now a <strong>desert </strong>is an area of land where very little can grow and there's very little water. <strong>Desert, </strong>d &ndash; e &ndash; s &ndash; e &ndash; r &ndash; t, has one 's', but <strong>dessert</strong>, d &ndash; e &ndash; s &ndash; s &ndash; e &ndash; r &ndash; t, has two 's'. A <strong>dessert</strong> is a sweet food course that we eat at the end of a meal. Right. Moving on. Neil, what do you do when you are <strong>bored</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well I find making cakes <strong>boring</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Really?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yeah. When I'm <strong>bored</strong>, I knit. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>You knit?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Of course - the hat! The woolly hat!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, I knitted this woolly hat.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It's fantastic!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Bored</strong> and <strong>boring</strong> &ndash; both adjectives, but with very different meanings.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Bored</strong>, b &ndash; o &ndash; r &ndash; e &ndash; d, describes how someone is feeling, when they are not interested in something. <strong>Boring</strong>, b &ndash; o &ndash; r &ndash; i &ndash; n &ndash; g, describes a thing that is not very interesting. Right. Let's have another clip.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br/></strong>The recipe looked easy &ndash; just a few <strong>ingredients</strong>. But when Mike checked the <strong>contents</strong> of his cupboard, there wasn't any sugar.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>The words <strong>ingredients </strong>and <strong>contents</strong> both mean things that are a part of something else. Individual <strong>ingredients</strong> are things that we put together to make something, usually food &ndash; a cake for example. <strong>Contents </strong>are all the separate items inside something like a box or a cupboard.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT<br/></strong>6 Minute Vocabulary, from bbclearningenglish.com.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And we're talking about confusing words.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And it's time for a quiz. Choose the correct word. Number one: I can't eat ice cream. My teeth are too&hellip; Is it a) sensible or b) sensitive?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And it's b)<strong> sensitive</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well done if you got that right. Number two: Very little rain falls in the&hellip; &nbsp;Is it a) desert or b) dessert?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the answer is a)<strong> desert</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And number three: I had to wait an hour for my appointment &ndash; I got really &hellip;. Is it a) boring or b) bored?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the answer is b) <strong>bored</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And that's the end of the quiz &ndash; well done if you got them right.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And it's almost the end of the programme.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But before we go, here's today's top tip for learning vocabulary: say new words out loud as you learn them - the word stress will help you to remember which is the correct word to use if you are not so sure.</p>

"<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me Finn...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>...and me Catherine. And in this programme we're talking about the letters <strong>o-u-g-h. </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yes, the letters <strong>o-u-g-h </strong>are found in lots of English words including <strong>cough</strong>,<strong> rough</strong>,<strong> ought </strong>and<strong> through</strong>, but there are lots of different pronunciations. So let's start with George. He's talking about last winter, when he was ill.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And think about this question while you listen: What did George do in February?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/> George<br/></strong>Last winter I had a <strong>cough</strong> for <strong>roughly</strong> three months. By February, I <strong>thought </strong>I <strong>ought</strong> to go to the doctor. He gave me a <strong>thorough</strong> check and some medicine. It got better in the end, <strong>although</strong> the <strong>cough</strong> lasted right <strong>through</strong> till April. I'm so glad spring's here!</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Poor George. And we asked: what did George do in February?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well, George <strong>thought</strong> that he <strong>ought </strong>to go to the doctor. So that's what he did.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Good. Now the words <strong>thought</strong>, spelt <strong>t-h-o-u-g-h-t </strong>and <strong>ought</strong>, spelt <strong>o-u-g-h-t,</strong> both have the <strong>o-u-g-h </strong>pattern in them and it's pronounced <strong>or</strong>. <strong>Thought, ought</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>Thought,<strong> ought</strong>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>And there are more <strong>o-u-g-h</strong> verbs with the same pronunciation, like <strong>fought</strong>, the past of <strong>fight</strong>, and <strong>bought</strong>, the past of <strong>buy</strong>...</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>...and <strong>brought</strong>,<strong> b-r-o-u-g-h-t</strong>, the past of <strong>bring</strong>. People sometimes confuse <strong>bought </strong>and <strong>brought</strong> so Catherine, can you give us an example sentence with both words?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I <strong>bought</strong> a new TV from the hypermarket and I <strong>brought</strong> it home in a taxi.</p>
<p>Now let's have another clip. And how <strong>o-u-g-h </strong>words are there in this one?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>George<br/></strong>Last winter I had a <strong>cough</strong> for <strong>roughly</strong> three months.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>So there were two <strong>o-u-g-h</strong> words there: <strong>Cough</strong>:<strong> c-o-u-g-h</strong> and <strong>roughly</strong>:<strong> r-o-u-g-h-l-y</strong>. <strong>Roughly</strong> means <strong>about</strong>, so George had a <strong>cough</strong> for about - or <strong>roughly</strong> - three months.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>But the pronunciation of these two words is different. The <strong>o-u-g-h</strong> in<strong> cough</strong> sounds like <strong>off</strong>.<strong> Off</strong>,<strong> cough</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And the <strong>o-u-g-h</strong> in<strong> roughly</strong> sounds like <strong>uff</strong>.<strong> Uff</strong>,<strong> roughly</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Right. So we're beginning to see that there is no real rule for pronouncing these words, Finn.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Sadly not, that's right. You are just going to have to learn to spell and say each word on its own.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK. Let's have another clip.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/>George<br/></strong>He gave me a <strong>thorough</strong> check...</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And the<strong> o-u-g-h </strong>word there was <strong>thorough</strong>:<strong> t-h-o-r-o-u-g-h</strong>. It means <strong>very careful and exact</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the pronunciation is different again. Listen to this one: <strong>thorough</strong>. It's an <strong>uh </strong>sound at the end of the word.<strong> Uh</strong>,<strong> thorough</strong>, <strong>uh</strong>,<strong> thorough.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Here's one more clip.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/>George<br/></strong>I got better in the end, <strong>although</strong> the cough lasted right <strong>through</strong> till April.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>This time we heard <strong>although</strong> spelt<strong> a-l-t-h-o-u-g-h</strong> and <strong>through, </strong>spelt<strong> t-h-r-o-u-g-h</strong>.&nbsp; Now the <strong>o-u-g-h</strong> in <strong>although, </strong>sounds like <strong>oh</strong>.<strong> Although</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And in<strong> through</strong>, it sounds like <strong>ooo</strong>. <strong>Through</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So you know what, that gives us six different pronunciations for the letters <strong>o-u-g-h</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right, six of them. We had: <strong>thought</strong>,<strong> cough</strong>,<strong> roughly</strong>,<strong> thorough</strong>,<strong> although </strong>and <strong>through</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So in fact there are more than six pronunciations for <strong>o-u-g-h</strong> in the English language, but these are the most common ones.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/> 6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And now it's time for the quiz! OK, question number one: How do you spell <strong>brought</strong>, the past simple of the verb <strong>bring</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It's <strong>b-r-o-u-g-h-t</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br/> Very good. Number two: How do you pronounce the word that is spelt <strong>t-h-o-u-g-h</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's <strong>though</strong>. <strong>Though</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br/> That's the one. Number three: <strong>Roughly</strong> and <strong>enough</strong> have similar spelling and pronunciation. How do you spell <strong>roughly</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It's <strong>r</strong>-<strong>o-u-g-h-l-y</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well done if you got all those right. Now before we go, here's our vocabulary tip. If your phone or computer lets you record audio, try recording the spelling and pronunciation of tricky words so you can play them back if you need help to remember them.</p>

<h3><strong>Vocabulary points to take away</strong></h3><p>Verbs with&nbsp;<strong>o-u-g-h</strong>&nbsp;in the past simple form, like&nbsp;<strong>thought&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>bought</strong>, are pronounced&nbsp;<strong>or</strong>: /'ɔ:/&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Taught</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>caught</strong>&nbsp;are pronounced like this too, but notice the different spelling:&nbsp;<strong>a-u-g-h-t</strong>.</p>
<p>There are at least five other ways to pronounce words with&nbsp;<strong>o-u-g-h</strong>&nbsp;in them. Common examples are:</p>
<p>cough /'kɒf/</p>

"<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Hi! I'm Finn.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And I'm Catherine. Welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. Today we're talking about false friends.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>But false friends aren't people! False friends are words that look or sound the same in two different languages - but have different meanings in each language.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right and today we'll give you plenty of examples...</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>...there will be a quiz of course...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>...and we'll also bring you a top tip for remembering these words.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>But first, here's Jim. He works as a student advisor, and he's talking about students' problems.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>While you're listening to Jim, try to guess what the student called Camilla's problem really was.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Jim<br/></strong>Lots of students come to me with their problems, but sometimes I have to guess what they mean! Claus from Germany asked me for a <strong>rat </strong>because his father was busy in the <strong>kitchen</strong>. Simone, who's French, was worried about the <strong>buttons</strong> on her face. Camilla, from Spain, didn't know what to do because she was <strong>embarrassed</strong>. And when I helped Pierre, he said ""Thank you very much, that's <strong>terrible</strong>!""</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So, did you guess what Camilla's problem really was?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the answer is Camilla was actually <strong>pregnant</strong>! But she used the wrong word when she said she was <strong>embarrassed</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>She did. Because <strong>embarrassed</strong> is a false friend in Spanish and English. The Spanish word <strong>embarazada</strong> means <strong>pregnant</strong>. Apologies for my Spanish pronunciation there! Spanish speaking people need to be very careful before they tell someone they are <strong>embarrassed - </strong>or that their husband is! Listen out for more false friends in this clip.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Jim<br/></strong>Claus from Germany asked me for a <strong>rat </strong>because his father was in the<strong> kitchen</strong>. Simone, who's French, was worried about the <strong>buttons</strong> on her face.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So I'm guessing that Claus didn't really want a <strong>rat</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I don't think so, I think he wanted some <strong>advice</strong> from Jim. The German word <strong>r</strong><strong>at</strong> means <strong>advice</strong> in English. And Claus was worried because his father was in <strong>prison</strong>. The word <strong>kitchen</strong> can mean <strong>prison</strong> in German.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Confusing. And what about Simone, who said she had <strong>buttons</strong> on her face...</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Indeed. In French, the word <strong>boutons</strong> means <strong>spots</strong>. So, Simone thought that the English word buttons had the same meaning.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK. Now, let's have another clip. Pierre also said something quite strange.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/>Jim<br/></strong>And when I helped Pierre, he said ""Thank you very much, that's <strong>terrible</strong>!""</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So do you think that Jim was upset when Pierre said that? After all, Jim was trying to help.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well, Pierre didn't mean to be rude. But in French <strong>terrible </strong>- like terrible - can have two meanings. It can mean <strong>very bad</strong>, but it can also mean <strong>great</strong>. It depends on the sound of your voice when you say it. Pierre meant that Jim's advice was <strong>great, </strong>not <strong>terrible</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Wow, big misunderstanding. So the message is: don't get upset if someone from another country says something that seems a bit strange or perhaps rude. They might just be using a word that's a false friend.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Exactly. And be very careful yourself when you're speaking in another language. You know, there was this one time, I was in a hotel in France and I asked for a <strong>cushion</strong> - I thought that meant a cushion - for my bed. But it sounded like the French word <strong>couchon</strong> which means <strong>pig</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So you asked for a pig for your bedroom!</p>
<p><strong>IDENT</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And it's time for a quiz! Today, we're going to play a guessing game. So number one: If a French man is holding some &pound;10 notes in his hand but he says that he's got no money, what does he mean?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>The answer is that he means he's got no coins. Yes, <strong>monnaie</strong> in French means <strong>coins</strong> or <strong>change.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Very good. And number two: If a German woman in an English restaurant says that she wants to <strong>become</strong> a steak, is she joking - or does she really want to turn into a meal?</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br/>Well, the answer is neither.<strong> Bekommen </strong>in German is a false friend for<strong> become </strong>in English<strong>. </strong>She means that she wants to get a steak to eat.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Right then. Number three: If someone from the US invites you to a party, Finn, and tells you to wear <strong>pants</strong>, should you be shocked?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well, actually, no, you shouldn't. <strong>Pants</strong> in American English means <strong>trousers</strong>. It doesn't mean <strong>underwear</strong> like in British English!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's a relief! And that's the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them all right. And before we go, here's a vocabulary tip. Keep a note of false friends between your language and English. You could use word cards, with the word on one side and the information with example sentences on the other.</p>

<h3><strong>Vocabulary points to take away</strong></h3><p>False friends are words that look the same in two languages but have different meanings. Some examples of false friends with English words are:</p>
<p><strong>embarazada</strong> - embarrassed<br/>Embarazada means <strong>pregnant</strong> in Spanish</p>

"<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Neil and…</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>...I'm Finn. Today's programme is all about academic English. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>If you are going to study or you are studying at an English-speaking university, you might be wondering how you'll cope with understanding lectures and academic texts…</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong>…and writing essays.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Yes. Academic English is different to the English people speak and write every day…</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>It's more formal and uses higher level words. So in today's programme, we'll give you ideas for understanding words and phrases that you'll come across…</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>…and some advice for writing essays and giving presentations. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong> <br><span>We'll also give you tips for studying in English… </span><span>But first, let's look at three main features of academic English: difficult English vocabulary... </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>…specialist subject vocabulary…</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>…and language for organising essays and presentations.<br><br></span><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>Now when you come across a word you don't know in an academic text or lecture, you can try to guess its meaning by looking at the context…</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>…or by seeing if the word looks like a word in your own language.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>This is a particularly useful strategy if your own language has lots of words from Greek or Latin as many of the words used in academic English come from those languages. Words, for example, like <strong>microscopic,</strong> which means tiny, or <strong>analysis</strong>, which means study…</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong>…or <strong>regeneration</strong>, which means renewal. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Another strategy for working out the meaning is to look at how a word is constructed. Academic English words often have prefixes and suffixes.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong>Remember, a prefix comes before the main part of the word and can change a word's meaning. For example, the prefix <strong>de</strong>, spelt <strong>d-e,</strong> means removing something, or reversing something.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>So, <strong>de-population</strong> means a reduction in the number of people somewhere, and <strong>de-forestation</strong> means clearing of trees from an area. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Suffixes are attached to the end of words.A common suffix in English is <strong>-ise, </strong>spelt <strong>i-s-e.</strong> Examples of words with <strong>-ise</strong> are <strong>stabilise, characterise </strong>and<strong> specialise</strong>. And these words are spelt with <strong>–ize</strong> in American English.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>That's right, they are. Now another common suffix is <strong>-ate, </strong>spelt<strong> a-t-e. </strong>Words with this suffix are<strong> differentiate </strong>and<strong> duplicate</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Specialist subject words may also cause difficulty. Now you can help yourself in two ways: Firstly, prepare yourself before lectures. Find some texts on your subject, on the internet or in journals and magazines, and study the recurring specialist words in those texts. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Yes, and to help yourself with this get hold of an English-English dictionary, and an English subject dictionary – for example of Medicine, or Law, or Linguistics. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>And secondly, listen to English radio and watch TV – now there are lots of specialist features which can help improve both your general and specialist English – and of course the BBC website has sections which have stories on technology, and science, and arts, which can also help.<span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>When writing your academic piece or giving a presentation, you will need to structure and organise your writing or presentation by using signposting language. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>You use signposts to indicate important parts of your essay such as stating its purpose, its structure, your views, the main points, and the direction of the argument and conclusions at the end as well.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Linking words and phrases show connections between sentences and paragraphs. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Yes, so Neil, let's give some examples of signposts. Firstly, for starting a piece of writing...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>The aim of this study is to…<br></span><span>This essay argues that… </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes. And how about for ending it…</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Finally…<br></span><span>In conclusion…</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>And some examples of linking words and phrases are…</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span><strong>First(ly), … second(ly), … finally,</strong> … </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>And for adding something, you could write…</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><strong><span>In addition, … furthermore, … </span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong>And if you want to show contrast, you might write…</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><strong><span>... however, … nevertheless, … on the other hand, … </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>IDENT<br></span></strong><span>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>And now for some tips for getting the best out of studying in English.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>OK, here's a good one. Have a study buddy – that's someone you can study with. You can test each other and support each other.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>And another one, set aside time for regular language study in addition to your academic study.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Time for a quiz. Complete the sentences. Number one: Many words in academic English come from a) Latin words, b) American words or c) newspapers?<br><br></span><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>It's a) Latin words. Now question two: A good way to start an essay is a) for example, b) in conclusion or c) this essay argues that?<br><br></span><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And it's c) this essay argues that. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>And the last question is: A good way to end an essay is a) on the other hand, b) in conclusion or c) this essay argues that?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And the answer is b) in conclusion.

"<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me Neil.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>And me, Finn. In this programme we're talking about phrases from Shakespeare. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>They're phrases that were either invented by Shakespeare or used by him in his plays and that we still use a lot today. We'll give you plenty of examples of these and we'll teach you what they mean.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>We'll have a quiz; and we'll also bring you a top tip for learning vocabulary.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Let's start with Danny. He's talking about cooking, and entertaining friends.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong>And while you listen, think about this question: Does Danny think it's easy to find special ingredients for recipes?</span></p>
<p><strong>Danny<br></strong>For some people food is <strong>the be-all and end-all</strong> and I have friends who, whenever I visit, produce <strong>a dish fit for the gods</strong>! But in my opinion, cooking<strong> is not for the faint-hearted</strong>. I really hate spending <strong>forever and a day</strong> in the kitchen. Dinner parties usually mean trying to track down some special ingredient, which ends up being <strong>a wild-goose chase</strong>. It's pretty much <strong>a foregone conclusion</strong> that my chosen recipe won't work out as I hope. So I just throw a party once a year to repay all my friends <strong>in one fell swoop</strong>. Fortunately, every one of them <strong>has a</strong> <strong>heart of gold</strong>, so they understand!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></span></strong>That was Danny. And we asked you: Does Danny think it's easy to find special ingredients for recipes?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong></span><span>And the answer is no, because usually it's <strong>a wild-goose chase</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Now <strong>a wild-goose chase </strong>is used in Romeo and Juliet. This means a situation where you waste time chasing after something that you can't get.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>So Danny clearly has had bad experiences of trying to find ingredients and not succeeding.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Exactly. Well, there are four more Shakespearean phrases in our first clip. Listen out for them!</span></p>
<p><span><strong>CLIP 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></strong>For some people food is <strong>the be-all and end-all</strong> and I have friends who, whenever I visit, produce <strong>a dish fit for the gods</strong>! But in my opinion, cooking <strong>is</strong> <strong>not for the faint-hearted</strong>. I really hate spending <strong>forever and a day</strong> in the kitchen.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong>So food is <strong>the be-all and end-all</strong>. That's the beginning and ending of everything, which means it's the most important thing. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And that's why they always produce <strong>a dish fit for the gods</strong>. Clearly if something is suitable for the gods, it is the best possible.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>But cooking <strong>is</strong> <strong>not for the faint-hearted</strong>, Danny says. <strong>The faint-hearted</strong> are people who lack courage or determination and he thinks people like that shouldn't cook. This phrase shows how difficult Danny finds cooking.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And he hates spending a long time in the kitchen.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>He does. <strong>Forever and a day</strong> is a very long time! Right, there are three more phrases coming up in our next clip.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>CLIP 2<br></strong></span><span>It's pretty much <strong>a foregone conclusion</strong> that my chosen recipe won't work out as I hope. So I throw a party once a year to repay all my friends <strong>in one fell swoop</strong>. Fortunately, every one of them has <strong>a</strong> <strong>heart of gold</strong>, so they understand!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Now, if something is <strong>a foregone conclusion</strong>, it's a result that is certain to happen. He thinks it's certain that his recipe won't work out.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>And that's why he entertains his friends <strong>in one fell swoop</strong>. Now if you deal with things <strong>in one fell swoop</strong>, that means you deal with them all together and suddenly, like a bird sweeping down through the air to attack something.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Yes, he doesn't want to cook for people more often than necessary! But fortunately his friends understand how he feels, don't they?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>They do. They each <strong>have a heart of gold</strong>. Now that means they are very kind and caring.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</span></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>And it's quiz time!&nbsp;Today you have to change the last three or four words of each sentence to use a phrase from Shakespeare from the programme. So number one: Some successful people don't go to university. It's really not <strong>the most important thing</strong>. Which phrase from Shakespeare can replace <strong>the most important thing</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></span></strong>It's really not <strong>the be-all and end-all</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br><span>Right. Number two. We got stuck in bad traffic so the journey took <strong>a very long time</strong>. So what can replace <strong>a very long time</strong>?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><br><span>The journey took <strong>forever and a day</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Correct! And number three: Everyone thinks Clare is the nicest person. She's always <strong>been very kind</strong>. What can replace <strong>very kind</strong>?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>She's always <strong>had a heart of gold</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>She has. That's excellent! And that is the end of our quiz. Well done if you got them all right. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>But before we go, here's today's top tip. English is very rich in phrases and idioms like the ones in this programme. Using them makes your English sound much more like that of a native speaker. Use an idioms dictionary and try learning five idioms a day. Then try working them into your conversations too.</span></p>

"<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I’m Finn.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br><span>And I’m Catherine.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>In today’s programme we’re talking about irregular verbs.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Yes, and as you know, there are lots of irregular verbs in English. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Lots and lots. Some, like <strong>write</strong>, have different forms for the past simple and past participle: <strong>wrote </strong>and <strong>written</strong>.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Yes and it's not always easy to remember all those different forms!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>It's not. Today, though, we’re going to explain how some of these verbs can be grouped into patterns to help remember the different forms.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine <br></span></strong><span>We’ll give you lots of examples…</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>We’ll have a quiz…</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>…and we’ll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>But first, let’s hear my interview with singer-songwriter Andrea.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>While you listen, think about this question: Who hasn’t spoken to Andrea for a long time?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<br></span></strong><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Hi, Andrea. Now, tell us: when did you <strong>begin</strong> to <strong>sing</strong>?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Andrea</span></strong><br><span>I <strong>sang</strong> in the school choir and I <strong>began</strong> to sing in bands when I was just ten.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Oh, wow. So how many songs have you <strong>written</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Andrea</span></strong><br><span>Over a hundred. I <strong>wrote</strong> one just before I <strong>drove</strong> here.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span></span><strong>Finn</strong><br><span>Right. And Andrea, I'm sure you have <strong>broken</strong> many men’s hearts. Tell us, who was the first?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Andrea</span></strong><br><span>Oh, he was a boy called Marcus. I <strong>knew</strong> him at school. We <strong>grew</strong> up on the same street. He’s not <strong>spoken</strong> to me since we <strong>broke</strong> up.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span></span><strong>Finn</strong><br><span>Since you broke up, that sounds bad. Thank you for coming and speaking to us today, Andrea.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Andrea</span></strong><br><span>Thanks for having me.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>STING</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br><span>And there we are. So, we asked you: Who hasn’t spoken to Andrea for a long time?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br><span>And the answer is: Marcus. They haven’t spoken since they <strong>broke</strong> up. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span><strong>Broke </strong>is the past simple of the verb <strong>break</strong> and it belongs to our first group of verbs. It has the pattern <strong>break</strong>, <strong>broke</strong>,<strong> broken</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>That's right, the past simple is <strong>broke</strong> and the past participle is <strong>broken</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Listen to this clip. Can you hear another verb with the same pattern? Here’s a clue. The word rhymes with <strong>broken</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 1</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Andrea</span></strong><br><span>Oh, he was a boy called Marcus. I <strong>knew</strong> him at school. We <strong>grew</strong> up on the same street. He’s not <strong>spoken</strong> to me since we <strong>broke</strong> up.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>OK, and <strong>spoken </strong>rhymes with <strong>broken</strong>. The verb <strong>speak</strong> forms its past simple and past participle in the same way as <strong>break</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>So it’s <strong>speak</strong>,<strong> spoke</strong>,<strong> spoken</strong>…</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And <strong>speak</strong> and <strong>break</strong> are pronounced differently although they both have e-a-k at the end.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>They do. Now, another verb with the same pattern is <strong>wake</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>… so it’s <strong>wake</strong>,<strong> woke</strong>,<strong> woken</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>… although we spell <strong>wake</strong>, w-a-k-e. It's not spelt e-a-k at the end. Now, in the interview, we had two other verbs with a different pattern.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>That's right, we had the past forms <strong>knew</strong> and <strong>grew</strong>. Andrea <strong>knew</strong> Marcus at school and she <strong>grew</strong> up on the same street.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Yes. These are the past simple forms of <strong>know</strong> and <strong>grow</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>So, it’s <strong>know</strong>,<strong> knew</strong>,<strong> known</strong>…</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span><strong>Grow</strong>,<strong> grew</strong>,<strong> grown</strong>…</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Another verb with this pattern is <strong>blow</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>So it’s <strong>blow, blew, blown</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>So we've got two groups. The first one is verbs like <strong>speak</strong>,<strong> spoke</strong>,<strong> spoken</strong>…</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>And we have in our second group, verbs like <strong>grow</strong>,<strong> grew</strong>,<strong> grown</strong>. Listen to this second clip and see if you can spot two more patterns. Here’s a clue: listen to words that rhyme or have similar pronunciations.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 2<br></span>Finn</strong><br><span>When did you <strong>begin</strong> to <strong>sing</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Andrea</span></strong><br><span>I <strong>sang</strong> in the school choir and I <strong>began</strong> to sing in bands when I was just ten.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span></span><strong>Finn</strong><br><span>Oh, wow. How many songs have you <strong>written</strong>?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Andrea</span></strong><br><span>Over a hundred. I <strong>wrote</strong> one just before I <strong>drove</strong> here.&nbsp;</span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Did you hear the patterns <strong>begin</strong>…<strong> began </strong>and<strong> sing</strong>…<strong> sang?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>So, this pattern is <strong>begin</strong>,<strong> began</strong>,<strong> begun</strong>…</span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Exactly, and we've got<strong> sing</strong>,<strong> sang</strong>,<strong> sung</strong>…</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>In the clip, we also had another pattern - <strong>wrote</strong>… <strong>written</strong>. So, that's the past simple and the past participle of <strong>write</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>We heard another verb with this pattern… <strong>drove</strong>, which is the past simple of <strong>drive</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>And the past participle is…</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>… <strong>driven</strong>. So that's <strong>drive</strong>, <strong>drove</strong>, <strong>driven</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And now for a quiz. I’ll give you two parts of a verb. You have to complete the pattern. Ready? Number one: swim, swam, ______.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>…<strong>swum</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Well done if you got that right. Number two: speak, ______, spoken.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>…<strong>spoke</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Correct. Number three: ______, wrote, written.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>…<strong>write</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br><span>And that’s the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them right.</span></p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br><span>And now, today’s top tip for learning vocabulary: combine irregular verbs with the same pattern in a short rhyme or story. The pattern of the rhyme will help you remember the different forms.</span></p>

"<p><strong>Callum<br> </strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me Callum.<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>And me Finn. Today we’re talking about words like Hoover and Xerox, which started as brand names of particular products, but now are often used to refer to other similar products.<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>And some of them are also used as verbs. Words like these are called eponyms.<strong><br> <br> Finn<br> </strong>There will be a quiz; and of course we’ll bring you a top tip for learning vocabulary.<strong><br> <br> Callum<br> </strong>But first let’s listen to Cath. She’s chatting a bit about brand names that have become part of the language.<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>And listen out for the answer to this question: how does Cath say <strong>do you use Facebook</strong>?<br> <br> <strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Cath<br></strong>‘I’ll <strong>google</strong> it.’ How many times a day do you think or say that? <strong>Google</strong> is the number one search engine today and people sometimes talk about <strong>googling</strong> even when they’re using a different search engine, like Bing or Yahoo. In the same way <strong>Facebook</strong> is number one for social networking and <strong>Skype</strong> for web chats. So do you <strong>facebook</strong> or <strong>skype</strong> your friends? And how often do you <strong>xerox</strong> a document or go <strong>rollerblading</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Right, that was Cath. And we asked: how does she say <strong>do you use Facebook</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br> </strong>And the answer is she said<strong> ‘do you facebook your friends?’</strong><br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>That’s right.&nbsp; Cath uses <strong>facebook</strong> as a verb because <strong>Facebook</strong> has become so much a part of our lives that we need a verb to talk about using it.<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>So that’s a bit like using the word <strong>Hoover</strong>, isn’t it?<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>Exactly. Until the middle of the twentieth century, the <strong>Hoover</strong> brand was the biggest name among vacuum cleaners. That’s why we say that we <strong>hoover</strong> our carpets.<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>But today that means ‘use any vacuum cleaner’, doesn’t it? Not just the <strong>Hoover</strong> brand.<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>It does. So in fact that’s a bit different from the verb to <strong>facebook</strong>. Because that only means to use the <strong>Facebook</strong> site. But who knows? It might change and be used more generally in the future to refer to other social media sites. Now let’s have our first clip?<br> <br> <strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> </strong>‘I’ll <strong>google</strong> it.’ How many times a day do you think or say that? <strong>Google</strong> is the number one search engine today and people sometimes talk about <strong>googling</strong> even when they’re using a different search engine like Bing or Yahoo.<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>So, that’s another example, a bit like <strong>Hoover</strong>. There’s the verb to <strong>google</strong>, the brand name <strong>Google</strong>, and the noun <strong>googling</strong> to talk about the activity of using <strong>Google</strong>.<strong><br> <br> Callum<br> </strong>Yes, and like <strong>hoover </strong>and<strong> hoovering </strong>are good for other vacuum cleaner brands, people can be using any search engine when they use the verb <strong>google</strong> and the noun <strong>googling</strong>.<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>Now, one thing to remember is that trademark names like <strong>Google, Facebook</strong> and <strong>Hoover</strong> should have a capital letter. But the verbs and nouns that come from these names don’t.<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>Mmm. On to clip 2.<strong><br> <br> INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br></strong>In the same way <strong>Facebook</strong> is number one for social networking and <strong>Skype</strong> for web chats. So do you <strong>facebook</strong> or <strong>skype</strong> your friends? And how often do you <strong>xerox</strong> a document or go <strong>rollerblading</strong>?</p>
<p><strong> <br> </strong><strong>Finn<br> </strong>So, Callum, what do we do when we use <strong>Skype</strong>?<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>Well, we <strong>skype</strong>!<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>We do. <strong>Skyping</strong> is a popular way to contact friends and business colleagues around the world. And this software has given up this new verb, <strong>to skype.</strong> And then Cath threw in another couple of examples with this type of word, didn’t she?<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>Yes, she talked about <strong>xeroxing</strong> a document. <strong>Xerox </strong>is often used to mean <strong>photocopy</strong>, both noun and verb, and it comes from the company <strong>Xerox</strong>, which produced the first plain paper photocopier.<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>But we should mention that this is an American English expression. It’s not one we use very often in British English.<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>She also mentioned going <strong>rollerblading</strong>. <strong>Rollerblade</strong> is a brand of inline skates that became so popular that we now have the verb to <strong>rollerblade</strong> and the noun <strong>rollerblading</strong>.<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>And today they’re used whatever brand of inline skates we’re using.<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br></strong>Other common words like these are <strong>Kleenex</strong> meaning any kind of paper tissue and <strong>Aspirin</strong> for painkillers. But they don’t have verbs to go with them.</p>
<p><br> <strong>IDENT</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> You’re listening to BBC Learning English.<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>And we’re talking about eponyms as nouns and verbs.<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>And time for the quiz! Number one: How else can I say <strong>do the vacuuming</strong>?<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>It’s <strong>do the hoovering</strong>.<br> <br> <strong>Finn</strong><br> It is! Number two: What’s another way of saying: <strong>I often talk to my friends on Skype</strong>?<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>It’s <strong>I often skype my friends</strong>.<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>Excellent! Number three: What does: <strong>Would you like a Kleenex</strong> mean?<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>It means: <strong>Would you like a tissue</strong>?<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>That's correct! And that’s the end of the quiz. <strong>Facebook</strong> your friends if you got them all right!<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>But before we go, here’s today’s top tip. &nbsp;If the name of an object has a capital letter, it’s probably because it’s an eponym from a brand. Look it up in a dictionary, where it should be labelled ‘trademark’, and check whether there are useful verbs or nouns that come from it. Practise making new sentences with those words.<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>There’s more about this at <a href=""http://www.bbclearningenglish.com"">bbclearningenglish.com</a>.

"<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me, Callum.<br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>And me, Finn. In this programme we’re talking about an interesting type of adjective. <strong><br><br>Callum<br></strong>Yes, they’re adjectives that are formed from the names of famous people such as authors, politicians and scientists. There’ll be lots of examples.<br><br><strong>Callum<br></strong>But first, here’s Ruth. She’s talking about some common adjectives from names that we use.<br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>And listen out for the answer to &nbsp;this question: Which adjective comes from the name of the author George Orwell? Here’s Ruth.<br><br><strong>INSERT </strong></p>
<p><strong>Ruth<br></strong>Charles Dickens is regarded as the greatest novelist of <strong>Victorian </strong>England and many of his books describe the poverty of that time. So what do we mean by <strong>Dickensian</strong> social conditions? And what about an <strong>Orwellian</strong> future? Have you read the book <em>1984</em> by the author George Orwell? A <strong>Churchillian</strong> speech is clearly the kind of speech made by the politician Winston Churchill. And you can probably guess which famous people these adjectives come from: <strong>a Freudian </strong>slip and a <strong>Thatcherite</strong> outlook on life.</p>
<p><strong>STING</strong><br><br><strong>Callum<br></strong>So that was Ruth. And we asked you which adjective comes from the name of the author George Orwell?&nbsp; <br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>And the answer is <strong>Orwellian</strong>. The suffix <strong>–ian</strong> is often added to the names of famous writers and scientists to form new adjectives.<br><br><strong>Callum<br></strong>Now these adjectives describe something that person is famous for. Orwell wrote about a nightmare vision of the future in his book <em>1984</em>, so an <strong>Orwellian </strong>future or society is terrible like the one in the book, with no individual freedom.<br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>And people sometimes say that reality TV programmes are Orwellian because they spy on what people are doing.<br><br><strong>Callum<br></strong>And I’ve heard politicians’ views described as Orwellian too.<br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>Listen for more of these adjectives in our first clip.<br><br><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></strong>Charles Dickens is regarded as the greatest novelist of <strong>Victorian </strong>England and many of his books describe the poverty of that time. So what do we mean by <strong>Dickensian</strong> social conditions?<br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>Now which two adjectives came from the names of famous people in that clip?<br><br><strong>Callum<br></strong>Well, there was <strong>Victorian</strong>. <strong>Victorian</strong> England means England when Queen Victoria ruled, which was from 1837 to 1901.<br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>Other queens and kings whose names are commonly used as adjectives include <strong>Elizabethan</strong>, <strong>Edwardian</strong> and <strong>Georgian.</strong><br><br><strong>Callum<br></strong>And with kings and queens it’s always their first names that are made into adjectives, not their surnames. Now that clip also used the adjective <strong>Dickensian</strong>. Ruth asked us what <strong>Dickensian</strong> social conditions are.<br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes, well, because Charles Dickens wrote a lot about the poverty of Victorian England, <strong>Dickensian</strong> social conditions are very poor, like those in his novels.<br><br><strong>Callum<br></strong>You could also say that a street or house is <strong>Dickensian</strong>, meaning that it is very old and in poor condition. But onto our second clip.<br><br><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br></strong>A <strong>Churchillian</strong> speech is clearly the kind of speech made by the politician Winston Churchill. And you can probably guess which famous people these adjectives come from: <strong>a Freudian </strong>slip and a <strong>Thatcherite</strong> outlook on life.<br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>A <strong>Churchillian </strong>speech. Now Churchill is famous for being a powerful, determined politician and a brilliant speaker.<strong><br><br>Callum<br></strong>So, a <strong>Churchillian</strong> speech is a powerful and brilliant speech. And we also heard <strong>a Freudian </strong>slip and a <strong>Thatcherite </strong>outlook on life.<br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes. <strong>Freudian </strong>from Freud, the psychologist. Freud wrote a lot about the unconscious mind. And <strong>a Freudian slip</strong> is a fixed phrase that means a mistake that you make, especially when speaking, caused by the thoughts in your unconscious mind. <br><br><strong>Callum<br>Thatcherite</strong> comes from Margaret Thatcher, who was a Prime Minister of the UK. Adjectives from politicians’ names are often formed with the suffixes <strong>–ist</strong> and <strong>–ite</strong>. Other examples are <strong>Stalinist </strong>from the Soviet leader Josef Stalin,<strong> Maoist </strong>from the Chinese Chairman Mao and <strong>Reaganite </strong>from former US President Reagan.<br><br><strong>IDENT</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>6 Minute Vocabulary from bbclearningenglish.com.<br><br><strong>Callum<br></strong>And we’re talking about adjectives that are formed from names.<br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>And it’s quiz time!&nbsp;Ready? Number one: Which of these nouns goes best with the adjective Orwellian? a) an Orwellian society&nbsp;b) Orwellian freedom.<br><br><strong>Callum<br></strong>The answer’s a) an Orwellian society.<br><br><strong>Finn</strong><br>Good. Number two: Are Dickensian conditions a) the conditions in which Charles Dickens lived, or b) any poor social living conditions?<br><br><strong>Callum</strong><br>It’s b) any poor living conditions.<br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>Well done! Number three: Tony Blair was a Prime Minister of the UK and the adjective from his name is like that of Margaret Thatcher. So would we talk about a) Blairist policies or b) Blairite policies?<br><br><strong>Callum<br></strong>The answer’s b) Blairite.<br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>And that’s the end of the quiz. And there’s lots more about this and other things at bbclearningenglish.com. Do join us again soon for more 6 Minute Vocabulary. <br><br><strong>Both<br></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Callum<br> </strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me Callum.<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>And me Finn. Today we’re talking about large numbers.<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>Particularly how we say and describe them in English. Here’s Anita, who’s giving a talk to a tour group visiting Russia.<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>Listen out for the answer to this question: How many metres high is Mount Elbrus?<br> <br> <strong>INSERT <br>Anita<br> </strong>Russia is a land of superlatives! At over <strong>6,500,000</strong> square miles, it's the largest country in the world. And the total area of cultivated land has been estimated as <strong>a six-figure number</strong>: perhaps <strong>500,000</strong> square miles. Its mountain ranges contain Mount Elbrus, which at <strong>5,642</strong> metres is the highest point in both Russia and Europe. Of its rivers, which are <strong>in the hundreds of thousands</strong>, the River Volga, the longest river in Europe, is the most well known. And what about the people? Well, here’s an interesting fact: the number of languages spoken in Russia is&nbsp;<strong>in triple figures</strong> – yes, over 100!<strong><br> <br> </strong><strong>Callum<br> </strong>So that was Anita. And we asked: How many metres high is Mount Elbrus?<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>And the answer is <strong>five thousand, six hundred and forty-two metres</strong> high.<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>Which is a good example of our topic today. When saying a large number, we always begin with the biggest number first. So thousands, then hundreds, then tens. Tens means numbers with two digits in them, like <strong>forty-two</strong>. Listen again.<br><strong><br> Finn<br> </strong><strong>Five thousand, six hundred and forty-two</strong>.<strong><br> <br> Callum<br> </strong>And the other point is, that the number labels are always singular. So <strong>five thousand</strong> and not five thousands.<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> Six hundred</strong> and not six hundreds.<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>Exactly. Now, notice that we don’t connect thousands and hundreds with the word <strong>and</strong>. It’s <strong>five thousand, six hundred</strong>.<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>Not five thousand and six hundred.<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>But we do connect hundreds and tens with the word <strong>and.</strong> So <strong>six hundred and forty-two. </strong>And I think it’s time for our first clip.<br> <br> <strong>INSERT CLIP 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> </strong>Russia is a land of superlatives! At over <strong>6,500,000</strong> square miles, it's the largest country in the world. And the total area of cultivated land has been estimated as a <strong>six-figure number</strong>: perhaps 500,000 square miles. <br> <br> <strong>Finn<br></strong>So we heard <strong>six million, five hundred thousand</strong>. Notice that we don’t connect millions to thousands with the word <strong>and </strong>either, or in this case, millions to hundreds of thousands. We say it like this: <strong>six million, five hundred thousand</strong>.<br><br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>Now, how did Anita describe the figure <strong>500,000</strong>? <br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>She described it as <strong>a six-figure number</strong>. Because it contains six digits. We could also say it’s <strong>a six-digit number</strong>.<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>Yes, we sometimes describe a number in this way to emphasise how big it is. And it doesn’t have to be six. It could be a <strong>five-figure</strong> or a <strong>four-figure</strong> <strong>number</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br> </strong>Now, on to clip 2.<strong><br> <br> INSERT CLIP 2<br> </strong>Of its rivers, which are <strong>in the hundreds of thousands</strong>, the River Volga, the longest river in Europe, is the most well known. And what about the people? Well, here’s an interesting fact: the number of languages spoken in Russia is&nbsp;<strong>in triple figures</strong> – yes, over 100!<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>So how did Anita describe the number of rivers in Russia?<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>She said they’re <strong>in the hundreds of thousands</strong>.<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>When we want to describe approximately what a number is, we can say it’s <strong>in the tens, the hundreds, the thousands</strong> and so on. <strong>Hundreds of thousands</strong> means at least 100,000 and probably a lot more.<strong><br> <br> Finn<br> </strong>So you could even say that a number is <strong>in the tens of millions</strong>.<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>There was also an interesting fact there about the number of languages spoken in Russia.<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>Anita said they’re <strong>in triple figures</strong>. That means that the number contains three figures – so at least 100. It’s the same as saying that the number is <strong>in the hundreds</strong>.<br> <br> <strong>IDENT</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> 6 Minute Vocabulary from bbclearningenglish.com.<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>And it’s quiz time! Number one: How do we say this number? <strong>8-9-2-1</strong>. That’s <strong>8-9-2-1</strong>.<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>It’s eight thousand, nine hundred and twenty-one.<br> <br> <strong>Callum</strong><br> Well done! Number two:&nbsp; What kind of number is <strong>300,000</strong>? Is it:&nbsp;a) a five-figure number b) a six-figure number c) a six-figures number?</p>
<p><strong>inn</strong><br> It’s b) a six-figure number.<br> <br> <strong>Callum.<br></strong>Correct! Number three: Listen to this number: <strong>19,242</strong>.&nbsp;Is it a) in the thousands b) in the tens of thousands c) in the hundreds of thousands?</p>
<p><strong> Finn<br> </strong>This one is b) In the tens of thousands.<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>Excellent! How did you do? Very well done if you got them all right.

"<p><strong>Catherine</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Catherine…</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>And I'm Finn. Now make sure you pay <strong>attention</strong> because we have a lot of <strong>information</strong>…</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>That's right… and <strong>attention </strong>and <strong>information</strong> are a good <strong>introduction</strong> to the programme.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>They are. They both end in<strong> 'shun'</strong> /ʃ(ə)n/, which is the suffix we're talking about.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>Suffixes are groups of letters at the end of words which can change the form or meaning of a word, or both.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>And we'll tell you about the three different ways to spell the suffix <strong>'shun'</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>And we'll give you examples of words with all three spellings, plus some tips for knowing which spelling to use…</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>We'll have a quiz…</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>…and we'll finish with a top tip for learning vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>But first, let's hear a news report about the theft of a valuable statue.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>While you listen, think about this question: Where was the statue from? Here’s the report.</p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<br></span></strong>A man was charged today following an <strong>investigation </strong>into the theft of valuable objects from the museum. The man confessed after witnesses came forward with <strong>information</strong> and his <strong>description </strong>appeared in the newspapers. In his <strong>confession</strong>,he said that he had gained<strong> admission </strong>to the museum by pretending to be a security guard. Police recovered items including a priceless <strong>Venetian</strong> vase and an <strong>Egyptian</strong> statue.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br>So, we asked you: Where was the statue from?</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br>And the answer is: Egypt. It was <strong>Egyptian</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>That's right. And the word <strong>Egyptian </strong>has the suffix <strong>'shun'</strong> spelt <strong>t-i-a</strong>-<strong>n</strong>. And we usually find this spelling in adjectives that describe where something or someone comes from.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>So, the stolen <strong>Egyptian</strong> statue came from Egypt…</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>Exactly, and the <strong>Venetian </strong>vase came from <strong>Venice</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>In these examples, the suffix <strong>'shun', </strong>spelt<strong> t-i-a-n,</strong> turns the noun into an adjective; and these adjectives are often written with a capital letter because they come from proper nouns. Now, another example is <strong>Martian -</strong>&nbsp;and Martians come from <strong>Mars</strong>!</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>I suppose they do. Let's listen to another clip with more words that end in<strong> 'shun'</strong>. See if you can spot them.</p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 1<br></span></strong>A man was charged today following an <strong>investigation </strong>into the theft of valuable objects from the museum. The man confessed after witnesses came forward with <strong>information</strong> and his <strong>description </strong>appeared in the newspapers.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>So we had three words ending in&nbsp;<strong>'shun'</strong> - <strong>investigation</strong>, <strong>description</strong>…</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>…and <strong>information</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>Now here, the<strong> 'shun' </strong>at the end is spelt<strong> t-i-o-n</strong>.This is the most usual spelling for <strong>'shun'</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>And words with <strong>'shun'</strong> spelt <strong>t-i-o-n</strong> are nouns. They usually come from verbs.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>So the word <strong>investigation</strong> comes from the verb <strong>investigate</strong>… the word <strong>description</strong> comes from <strong>describe</strong>…</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>…and the word <strong>information</strong> comes from the verb <strong>inform</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>There are many words with this spelling of <strong>'shun'</strong>. We told you to pay <strong>attention</strong> at the start of the programme…</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>Yep and there are other words like <strong>addition</strong>,<strong> subtraction</strong>,<strong> accommodation</strong>,<strong> population</strong>…</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>Many, many more. So that’s words with the suffix <strong>'shun'</strong> spelt <strong>t-i-o-n </strong>and <strong>t-i-a-n</strong>. Now let's look at the third spelling of the suffix <strong>'shun'</strong>: <strong>s-i-o-n</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>And here they are in another clip.</p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 2<br></span></strong>In his <strong>confession</strong>,he said thathe had gained<strong> admission </strong>to the museum by pretending to be a security guard.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>So we had<strong> confession </strong>and<strong> admission.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>Yes, nouns with the ending <strong>'shun'</strong> spelt <strong>s-i-o-n</strong> are often based on words ending in&nbsp;double <strong>-s</strong> or -<strong>m-i-t</strong> like <strong>confession</strong> from <strong>confess</strong>...</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong><strong>E</strong><strong>xpression</strong> from <strong>express</strong>…</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>… <strong>discussion</strong> from <strong>discuss</strong>…</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>…<strong>admission</strong> from <strong>admit…</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>…and <strong>permission </strong>from <strong>permit</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>You're listening to BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>And we're talking about the suffix <strong>'shun'</strong>. We can spell it in three different ways…</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>There's <strong>t-i-a-n</strong>, as in <strong>Egyptian</strong> or <strong>Venetian. </strong>These are adjectives which indicate someone or something's origin.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>Or we can spell it&nbsp;<strong>s-i-o-n</strong>. And these words are nouns and are often based on verbs ending in -<strong>s-s</strong>, like <strong>discussion</strong> from <strong>discuss</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>…or verbs ending in<strong> -t </strong>like <strong>permission</strong> from <strong>permit</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>And finally, the most common spelling <strong>t-i-o-n</strong>, as in nouns like<strong> information</strong> and <strong>ambition</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>Oh, ambition, yeah. Catherine, do you have a secret <strong>ambition</strong>?</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>I have an ambition. It's not so secret but I would love to go to Africa on a safari. What about you, Finn?</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>Oh, yes, travel as well. I’d love to travel through South America one day.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>I hope you get to do it.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>Quite soon. Now, time for a quiz. What is the correct spelling for the ending of these words. Is it<strong> t-i-o-n, s-i-o-n, </strong>or<strong> t-i-a-n?&nbsp;</strong> Ready?</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>OK…</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>Number one: <strong>Egyptian…</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>Egyptian is <strong>t-i-a-n</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>Good. Number two: <strong>permission.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>Permission: <strong>s-i-o-n</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>And number three: <strong>attention.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>Attention ends with the suffix <strong>'shun'</strong> spelt<strong> t-i-o-n</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>Fantastic. And that's the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them right.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br>And now, here's a top tip for learning vocabulary: to help you learn new words, try linking them into a story. Now this can really help you remember their meaning.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>Top tip. And there's more about this at bbclearningenglish.com. Join us again for more 6 Minute Vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Both</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Catherine</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Catherine…</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br> And I'm Finn. And Catherine, I see you've got a new phone there. Was it <strong>expensive</strong>?</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>It was a bit <strong>pricey</strong>, Finn, but not as <strong>dear</strong> as my last one. But, do you like it?</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>I love it. I'm a little bit jealous.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>It is nice, isn't it?</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>And we used three words there: <strong>expensive</strong>, <strong>pricey </strong>and <strong>dear</strong> and they're all synonyms. They all mean that something cost a lot of money and they're the topic of this programme.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>That's right. Synonyms are words that have the same or similar meanings. And English speakers use a lot of synonyms, so it's good to learn a few.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>It certainly is. We'll give you lots of them in this programme...</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>We'll give you a quiz…</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>… and a top tip for improving your vocabulary using synonyms.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> So, let's start by listening to Rob and Mike discussing a television advert.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br> Think about this question while you listen: what kind of pet do Mike's kids have – and what was <strong>strange </strong>about it?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong><span>Mike<br></span></strong>You know that <strong>funny</strong> advert where the vet thinks he's dealing with a dead cat but it's really a furry hat?</p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong>Oh yeah, it's <strong>hilarious</strong>. That <strong>look</strong> on the vet's face is so <strong>comical</strong> and the girl's <strong>expression</strong> when she picks up her hat is <strong>priceless</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong><br><strong>Strange </strong>thing is the same thing happened to me – quite<strong> bizarre </strong>actually – I was holding the kids' hamster while they were cleaning the cage. I thought it was a bit <strong>odd </strong>because it wasn't moving. My daughter gave me a<strong> weird </strong>look and asked why I was stroking one of her gloves!</p>
<p><strong>STING</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br> So, what kind of pet do Mike's kids have – and what was <strong>strange </strong>about it?</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br> It was quite strange. The answer is: they have a hamster – but Mike thought it was a bit <strong>odd</strong>,because it wasn't moving.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>Now<strong> strange </strong>and <strong>odd </strong>are synonyms. They both mean <strong>unusual</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>Listen to this clip for two more words that Mike uses to mean strange or unusual.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br></strong><strong>Mike<br></strong><strong>Strange </strong>thing is the same thing happened to me – quite<strong> bizarre </strong>actually – I was holding the kids' hamster while they were cleaning the cage. I thought it was a bit <strong>odd </strong>because it wasn’t moving. My daughter gave me a<strong> weird </strong>look and asked why I was stroking one of her gloves!</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>So we heard the word <strong>bizarre</strong>,spelt<strong> b-i-z-a-r-r-e</strong>,which means strange and difficult to explain. Mike thought the situation was bizarre. We also heard <strong>weird</strong>, spelt <strong>w-e-i-r-d</strong>, which also means very unusual.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>Let's listen to another clip with some more synonyms. And this time try to spot three words that mean <strong>funny</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><br><strong><span>Mike<br></span></strong>You know that <strong>funny</strong> advert where the vet thinks he's dealing with a dead cat but it's really a furry hat?</p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong>Oh yeah, it's <strong>hilarious</strong>. That <strong>look</strong> on the vet’s face is so <strong>comical</strong> and the girl's <strong>expression</strong> when she picks up her hat is <strong>priceless</strong>!</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>So <strong>hilarious</strong>,<strong> comical</strong> and <strong>priceless </strong>are all synonyms of<strong> funny</strong>. But they mean funny in a slightly different way: <strong>hilarious</strong> means very funny, in the sense that it makes you laugh out loud, <strong>comical</strong> means funny in a silly way…</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>…and<strong> priceless </strong>can mean extremely funny. We usually only use it with this meaning when we're speaking. There are some other synonyms of funny, too, including<strong> humorous</strong> and<strong> amusing</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>And in the clip we heard two noun synonyms – <strong>look</strong> and <strong>expression</strong>, both meaning the way someone shows on their face what they are thinking or feeling.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> You're listening to BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br> And we're talking about synonyms. Like <strong>strange</strong> and <strong>odd</strong>…</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>…and <strong>funny</strong> and <strong>amusing</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>Now a word of warning – we can't always use any synonym to replace a word – it depends on the context and what exactly we're trying to say.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>That's right. So, for example, at the beginning of the programme, I said that my new phone was <strong>pricey</strong>, spelt <strong>p-r-i-c-e-y</strong>, and I also used the word <strong>dear</strong>, spelt<strong> d-e-a-r</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>And both words are synonyms of <strong>expensive</strong>. But <strong>pricey</strong> is more informal and more modern than <strong>dear</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>So you won't see those written down very much.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>Not much, no. And our top tip for learning vocabulary is: use a thesaurus, which is a dictionary of synonyms, to help you find new words and make your English more interesting. And look for example sentences with each word to help you choose the right word for each situation.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br> And now, it's time for a quiz. Which is the odd one out? Number 1: a) expensive, b) dear, c) cheap.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> That one is c) <strong>cheap</strong>, because the other two mean <strong>costing a lot money</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> Very good. And number two: a) bizarre, b) hilarious, c) weird.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> And the answer is b)<strong> hilarious</strong>. Because <strong>bizarre</strong> and<strong> weird</strong> are both synonyms of <strong>strange</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>Number three: a) humorous, b) hilarious, c) expression.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>And the answer to that is c)<strong> expression</strong>, because the other two are both synonyms of funny.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br> And that's the end of the quiz – well done if you got them right.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>Well done indeed. There's more about this at bbclearningenglish.com. Join us again for more 6 Minute Vocabulary.</p>

"<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me Callum.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And me Catherine. In this programme we’re talking about interjections. Interjections are words that we use to express an emotion or feeling.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>For example <strong>Oh!</strong> expresses surprise and <strong>Hooray!</strong> expresses pleasure when something good happens. We’ll give you plenty of other examples.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>We’ll have a quiz; and we’ll finish with a top tip for learning vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Here are Peter and Kylie. They’re at home in their kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And while you listen, think about this question: What emotion does Peter express by the word <strong>Phew!</strong> at the end of this conversation?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Peter and Kylie</strong></p>
<p>Peter:<strong> Ow!<br></strong>Kylie: What’s wrong?<br>Peter: I’ve just cut my finger.<br>Kylie:<strong> Oh!</strong> Quick, where’s the First Aid kit?<br>Peter: It’s in that drawer.<br>Kylie: Got it. <strong>Ugh</strong>! There’s blood everywhere. <strong>Oh no!</strong> It’s on my T-shirt now. Let me see your finger.<br>Peter: There you go.<br>Kylie: There, got the plaster on it, <strong>hooray</strong>! <br>Peter:<strong> Phew</strong>! Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>STING</strong></p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>So that was Peter and Kylie. And we asked: What emotion does Peter express by the word <strong>Phew</strong>! at the end of the conversation?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answer is that he expresses relief. Peter feels relieved that Kylie has got the plaster on his finger.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>He does. People use interjections a lot in everyday speech. It’s interesting that one little word like <strong>Phew!</strong> can express so much, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>It is. And that’s why it’s important to learn to use interjections when your speaking, to make your English sound more natural and fluent.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Now, interjections usually come at the beginning of what we are saying, but they can sometimes come at the end.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>So Peter says <strong>Phew! Thanks</strong>, but he could have said <strong>Thanks. Phew!</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>But, whichever way he says it, the interjection stands alone. There are no words to connect it to what comes after or before it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>That’s right, and if you’re writing a conversation with interjections, they’re usually followed by an exclamation mark.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Because the exclamation mark emphasises the strength of the emotion and increases the interest for the reader. <strong>Phew!</strong> with an exclamation mark looks more dramatic than <strong>Phew.</strong> with a full stop.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>It does. That’s interesting, isn’t it? Let’s have our first clip.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Peter:<strong> Ow!<br></strong>Kylie: What’s wrong?<br>Peter: I’ve just cut my finger.<br>Kylie:<strong> Oh!</strong> Quick, where’s the First Aid kit?<br>Peter: It’s in that drawer.<br>Kylie: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right. So what does Peter express with <strong>Ow!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong><strong>Ow!</strong> expresses sudden pain. We can say <strong>Ouch!</strong> too. They mean the same.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the second interjection was <strong>Oh!</strong> Kylie uses it to show surprise and alarm that Peter has cut his finger.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Yes. Now if you wanted to describe the scene in writing you would have to say: <strong>Peter shouted in sudden pain</strong>, instead of using<strong> Ow! </strong>Or <strong>Peter’s voice expressed relief</strong>, instead of using<strong> Phew!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>That’s right. Interjections are very useful when speaking, but they’re not often used in written English, except for writing dialogues like the one between Peter and Kylie.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>OK. Let’s have our second clip.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2</strong></p>
<p>Kylie: <strong>Ugh</strong>! There’s blood everywhere. <strong>Oh no!</strong> It’s on my T-shirt now. Let me see your finger.<br>Peter: There you go.<br>Kylie: There, got the plaster on it, <strong>hooray</strong>! <br>Peter:<strong> Phew</strong>! Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK. Kylie uses three interjections there! No we don’t usually use so many together but the situation is quite dramatic, so it’s natural to use them together there.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>There was <strong>Ugh!</strong>, which expresses disgust at the blood everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And there was <strong>Oh no!</strong> which expresses shock. Kylie was a bit shocked that the blood was on her T-shirt.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>And finally <strong>Hooray! </strong>That expresses pleasure or delight that something good has happened. Kylie was very pleased that she’d managed to get the plaster on Peter’s finger.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Other common interjections are <strong>Wow! </strong>for admiration, <strong>Oops!</strong> for when you make a mistake and <strong>Yippee!</strong> for excitement.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT</strong></p>
<p>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>It’s time now for our quiz! Listen to each sentence, then choose the correct interjection to go before each one. Number one: There’s a dead snake in the road. Is it a) Ouch! Or b) Ugh!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>It’s b) Ugh! for disgust</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>It is! Number two:&nbsp; What a beautiful building. Is it a) Wow! Or b) Hooray!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>It’s a) Wow! for admiration.</p>
<p><strong>Callum.<br></strong>Correct! Number three: Amy’s passed her driving test. Is it a) Oops! Or b) Phew!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>It’s b) Phew! for relief</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Excellent! That’s the end of the quiz and congratulations if you got them all right.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Before we go, here’s today’s top tip.&nbsp; When you’re speaking everyday English, you don’t always need to use high-level vocabulary to express your meaning. It’s more important to be clear and sometimes simple words like interjections express your meaning much more clearly than a sentence with advanced vocabulary in it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Both<br></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Hello! Welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I’m Finn.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And I’m Catherine. In this programme, we’re talking about misspelt words.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Let's start by listening to Marcus. He's talking about his last holiday.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And here’s a question for while you’re listening: What was the weather like on Marcus’s holiday?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Marcus<br></strong>Last year we decided to have a <strong>foreign</strong> holiday. We <strong>travelled</strong> by coach to Rome and the <strong>scenery</strong> in northern Italy was beautiful. Our hotel <strong>accommodation</strong> was great, and we had some <strong>wonderful</strong> meals in <strong>restaurants</strong>. The weather was a bit <strong>changeable</strong> until the third day but it didn’t matter. We got to <strong>practise</strong> our Italian and it’s a lot better now. The whole thing was a great <strong>experience</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>STING</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>We asked you: What was the weather like on Marcus’s holiday?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answer is that the weather was a bit <strong>changeable</strong> and that brings us to our first common spelling mistake. <strong>Changeable</strong> is spelt <strong>c-h-a-n-g-E-a-b-l-e</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes, there are quite a lot of words with the letters <strong>g-e</strong> in them, and the <strong>e</strong> shows that the <strong>g</strong> is pronounced softly as /dʒ/, chan<strong>ge</strong>able.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Other examples of words with <strong>g-e</strong> in the middle are <strong>manageable, management, knowledgeable </strong>and <strong>acknowledgement. </strong>And they all have the <strong>e</strong> after the <strong>g</strong>. &nbsp;But what other words with tricky spellings did we hear? Listen.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Last year we decided to have a <strong>foreign</strong> holiday. We <strong>travelled</strong> by coach to Rome and the <strong>scenery</strong> in northern Italy was beautiful. Our hotel <strong>accommodation</strong> was great, and we had some <strong>wonderful</strong> meals in <strong>restaurants</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Now the spelling of<strong> foreign </strong>is interesting. There’s a spelling rule that says you must put <strong>i</strong> before <strong>e</strong> except after <strong>c</strong>. And that’s a really good rule for lots of words.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Like <strong>believe</strong>, spelt <strong>b-e-l-I-E-v-e</strong> and <strong>receive </strong>spelt <strong>r-e-c-E-I-v-e</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Exactly. Or <strong>field </strong>spelt <strong>f-i-e-l-d</strong> but <strong>ceiling</strong>, with a c, <strong>c-e-i-l-i-n-g.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, so<strong> foreign</strong> breaks the rule, doesn’t it?&nbsp; It’s spelt <strong>f-o-r-e-i-g-n</strong>. And there’s no letter <strong>c </strong>there.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>No, that’s an exception.And there are a few others like<strong> leisure </strong>and <strong>weird. </strong>They both have<strong> e-i -</strong>but not after a<strong> c. </strong>It’s really worth learning these.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>What other tricky spellings were there in that clip? We heard<strong> travelled. </strong>How many &nbsp;<strong>l</strong>s are there in travelled?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>There are two. In British English, with verbs that end in a vowel before <strong>l</strong> or <strong>r</strong>, we double the final consonants when we make them into past or continuous forms.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Finally there were three nouns that can cause spelling problems. What were they, Catherine?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>They were be <strong>scenery, accommodation</strong> and <strong>restaurants</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong><strong>Scenery </strong>starts with an<strong> s </strong>sound, but it is spelt with<strong> s-c .</strong> It’s easy to forget the <strong>c </strong>because you don’t hear it. The words <strong>science</strong> and <strong>scissors</strong> are the same.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now <strong>accommodation </strong>has a double <strong>c </strong>and a double <strong>m</strong> and <strong>restaurant</strong> has the letters <strong>au</strong> in the middle. No rule for these I’m afraid! They just have to be learnt. Next clip!</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br></strong>We got to <strong>practise</strong> our Italian and it’s a lot better now. The whole thing was a great <strong>experience.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>So how do you spell the verb <strong>practise</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>So the verb <strong>practise </strong>&nbsp;is <strong>p-r-a-c-t-i-S-e</strong>. It ends in <strong>s-e</strong> not <strong>c-e. </strong>That’s a very common mistake because the noun<strong> practice </strong>is spelt with <strong>i-c-e </strong>at the end.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>And finally we heard<strong> experience. </strong>Now is that<strong> e-n-c-e </strong>or<strong> a-n-c-e </strong>at the end?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>Experience</strong> ends in <strong>e-n-c-e</strong>. Whereas <strong>performance</strong> ends in <strong>a-n-c-e</strong>. And yet again &nbsp;there’s no rule for these spellings. You just have to check them and learn them.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And it’s quiz time! Number one. My sister’s new baby’s very loveable. But how do you spell <strong>loveable</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>It’s<strong> l-o-v-e-a-b-l-e.&nbsp; </strong>Not forgetting the <strong>e</strong> in the middle.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>You’re right! &nbsp;Now question two: The word <strong>ancient</strong> – meaning very old - does not follow the usual rule. Can you spell it?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Ancient is <strong>a-n-c-i-e-n-t</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly, and question three: How many<strong> l</strong>s are there in <strong>quarrelling</strong>, meaning arguing?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>The answer’s two<strong> l</strong>s<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Double <strong>l</strong>, that’s correct, well done.&nbsp; And well done if you got those right at home. There’s more about this at bbclearningenglish.com. Join us again soon for more 6 Minute Vocabulary.</p>

"<h3>Linking words</h3>
<p>Catherine and Rob explore the topic of linking words and hear the story of Angela and her rescue, just when they thought it was safe to go back in the water...</p><br/><p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I’m Rob…</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And I’m Catherine. And this programme is all about linking words, the words and phrases we use to connect ideas and events when we speak or write.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, we call them linking words and phrases. They help people to follow what we’re saying by showing how ideas are connected to each other.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>First</strong>, we’ll look at some examples…</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong><strong>Next</strong>, there will be a short quiz…</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And <strong>finally</strong>, we’ll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>But to start with, let’s listen to Angela talking about a lucky escape she had. While you listen, try to answer this question: who or what saved Angela in the end?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>Here’s Angela.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Presenter<br></strong>So Angela, tell us: what did you escape from?<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Angela<br> </strong>A shark.</p>
<p><strong>Presenter<br> Wow! Really…?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Angela<br> </strong>Yes, <strong>what happened was</strong> I was swimming off the coast, when <strong>all of a sudden,</strong> I saw a huge black shape coming towards me. <strong>To begin with</strong>, I thought it was a dolphin…</p>
<p><strong>Presenter<br> </strong>But it wasn’t. So, <strong>what happened next</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Angela<br> </strong>Well, I <strong>then</strong> quickly realised it was a shark. <strong>Luckily</strong>, I’m a very fast swimmer. But <strong>in the end</strong>, it was a boat that saved me.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>That’s an incredible story! We asked: who or what saved Angela?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>It was a boat. Angela said “<strong>In the end</strong>, a boat saved me.”</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>Lucky lady. Now Angela helped us to follow her story by using linking words and phrases to tell us what happened, when it happened and how she felt about it. Let’s have a look at some of them.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>OK, right, now the first one was right at the beginning. Angela said ""<strong>What happened was…</strong>""and this is a really good way tointroduce a story because it grabs the listener’s attention and it tells them to get ready to hear a story. Have a listen.</p>
<p><strong>Angela<br> What happened was</strong> I was swimming off the coast, when <strong>all of a sudden</strong>, I saw a huge black shape coming towards me.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>OK, good start. Now another way to tell your story clearly is to say words that show the order of events. Catherine and I did this at the beginning of this programme when we used words like <strong>First</strong>, <strong>Next</strong> and <strong>Finally</strong>: <strong>First</strong>, we’ll look at examples …,</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> Next</strong>, there will be a short quiz…&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>And <strong>finally</strong>, we’ll leave you with a top tip…</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly. Now let’s listen to how Angela used words and phrases like these.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Angela<br> What happened was</strong> I was swimming off the coast, when <strong>all of a sudden,</strong> I saw a huge black shape coming towards me. <strong>To begin with</strong>, I thought it was a dolphin…</p>
<p><strong>Presenter<br> </strong>But it wasn’t. So, <strong>what happened next</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Angela<br> </strong>Well, I <strong>then</strong> quickly realised it was a shark. <strong>Luckily,</strong> I’m a very fast swimmer. But <strong>in the end</strong>, it was a boat that saved me.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>So, when you get to the end of your story use a phrase like <strong>in the end </strong>or <strong>finally </strong>to show that your story’s about to finish.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Angela<br> </strong>But in the end it was a boat that saved me.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>OK. Now, let’s hear Angela tell us about how the boat saved her.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> <br> Angela<br> Fortunately</strong>, the boat had already seen the shark and fired a rocket, which scared the creature off.</p>
<p><strong>Presenter<br> </strong>That was lucky!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>Wow, so Angela uses the adverb <strong>fortunately</strong> as a linking word to comment on this.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> Yes and in the first clip Angela said: ""<strong>Luckily, I’m a fast swimmer</strong>."" Other comment adverbs you may hear include <strong>unfortunately</strong>, <strong>sadly </strong>and so on. &nbsp;And we can also use adverbs and adverbial phrases like <strong>suddenly</strong> or <strong>all of a sudden</strong>, which we heard in the first clip to say how things happen.</p>
<p><strong>STING</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>We’re talking about words and phrases that link different sentences and parts of a story.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>Yep and it’s time for a quick recap. So, to start a story we had…</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> Well, what happened was</strong>…</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>For ordering events:</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> First of all, to begin with, then, next, after that…</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>To finish a story…</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> Finally, in the end.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>To make a comment:</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> Luckily, unfortunately, sadly</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>And lastly we had:</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong><strong>Suddenly, all of a sudden</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>Great, now it’s quiz time. Choose the correct linking word or phrase to fill the gaps. Number one: I tried for weeks to get a ticket to the final. [sfx: beep] I gave up. Is it a) In the end or b) Next.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>It’s a) <strong>In the end</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Well done. Number two. It started to rain. [sfx: beep] I had an umbrella with me. Is it a) Suddenly or b) Luckily.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>It’s b) <strong>Luckily</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Finally, number 3: Which is the correct phrase to introduce your story? Is it a) What happened was … or b) What happened it … ?</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>And it’s a) <strong>What happened was</strong>…</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>It is, and well done to you if you got those right. Now before we finish here’s Rob with a quick tip for learning vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Yes, why not make a note of new linking devices when hear other people speak English – on the bus, waiting in a queue or watching TV. Note them on your phone or just write them down somewhere and then try to use them yourself.</p>

"<h3>Words with more than one spelling</h3>
<p>Do you get confused about which of two possible spellings to use? Are you unsure whether it’s dis<strong>c</strong> or dis<strong>k</strong>, sympathi<strong>s</strong>e or sympathi<strong>z</strong>e, learn<strong>t</strong> or learn<strong>ed</strong>?&nbsp;&nbsp;Then join&nbsp;Finn and Catherine in 6 Minute Vocabulary for some useful tips!</p><br/>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Hello! Welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me, Catherine.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>And me, Finn. And today we’re talking about words that have more than one spelling. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Let's start by listening to Jack. He’s a professor of linguistics and he’s talking about changes in the English language.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>While you listen, think about this question: How do you think the word <strong>disc </strong>is usually spelt in British English?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Jack<br></strong></span><span>Today most of the influence on English spelling comes from North America. For example the words <strong>analogue, disc</strong>, <strong>enquire </strong>are <strong>spelt </strong>differently in American English. And these spellings are often used in British English too. And that’s generally <strong>all right</strong> by us. However, there are other spelling differences that we don’t think are correct in British English. For we Brits, it’s definitely wrong to spell <strong>colour</strong> or <strong>neighbour </strong>without the<strong> u</strong>. It’s also wrong to spell <strong>theatre</strong> in the American way.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong>So we asked you: how is <strong>disc </strong>usually spelt in British English?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And the answer is that it’s usually spelt with a<strong> c</strong>, so<strong> d-i-s-c.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>But in American English, it’s spelt <strong>d-i-s-k. </strong>So two different spellings there, but it's ok to spell <strong>disk</strong> with a <strong>k</strong> in British English when we're talking about computers and computing. What other words were mentioned? Let’s have our first clip.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 1<br></span></strong><span><strong>Jack&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></strong>For example the words <strong>analogue, disc</strong>, <strong>enquire </strong>are <strong>spelt </strong>differently in American English.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>So another computing term there: the word<strong> analogue</strong>, as in analogue clock, is spelt <strong>a-n-a-l-o-g-u-e</strong> in British English. But it’s spelt without the <strong>u-e</strong> in American English: so <strong>a-n-a-l-o-g</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>And there are a few more words with different spellings in American and British English. We're not saying that one spelling is better than another…</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>… but it's good to be aware of the differences. Now, the word<strong> enquire</strong>, meaning to ask about something, usually begins with the letter <strong>e</strong> in British English: <strong>e-n-q-u-i-r-e</strong>, whereas in American English it's spelt with an <strong>i</strong> at the beginning, not an <strong>e. </strong>Did you notice the word <strong>spelt</strong>? That’s the past participle of the verb <strong>spell</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Yes, that’s <strong>s-p-e-l-t</strong> in British English. But in North America, they prefer <strong>spelled</strong>, <strong>s-p-e-l-l-e-d</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>We’re happy with both nowadays. You can choose which to use. It’s the same for other verbs like <strong>learn</strong>, <strong>dream </strong>and<strong> burn</strong>. You can say <strong>learnt, burnt </strong>and<strong> dreamt</strong> with a <strong>t </strong>at the end or <strong>learned, burned </strong>and<strong> dreamed</strong> with <strong>e-d</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong></span><span>And there's a slight difference in pronunciation there too, isn't there?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br><span>Yes, even in my best British accent you can hear the </span><span><strong>d</strong> and the <strong>t</strong> sounds at the end: <strong>burned</strong>,<strong> burnt</strong>.<strong> Learned</strong>,<strong> learnt</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong></span><span>Now some words have two spellings - but it’s nothing to do with American influence. Listen to this clip.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 2<br></span></strong><span><strong>Jack<br></strong></span><span>And that’s generally <strong>all right</strong> by us.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>And there we heard <strong>all right</strong>. You can spell that as two words, <strong>all</strong> and <strong>right</strong>. Or you can spell it as one word: <strong>a-l-r-i-g-h-t</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>It's becoming quite common to see <strong>all right</strong> as two words, although some people still think that <strong>alright</strong> as one word is incorrect when writing.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Other words with two spellings are <strong>barbecue</strong>, meaning cooking food outdoors, spelt </span><span><strong>b-a-r-b-e-C-u-e </strong>or <strong>b-a-r-b-e-Q-u-e</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And there’s also <strong>racket</strong> as in tennis racket. It’s almost always spelt <strong>r-a-c-k-e-t</strong>, but it can be spelt <strong>r-a-c-q-u-e-t</strong> as well. One more clip please.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT 1 CLIP 3<br>Jack<br></span></strong><span>It’s definitely wrong to spell <strong>colour</strong> or <strong>neighbour </strong>without the<strong> u</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>So <strong>colour</strong>, spelt<strong> c-o-l-o-u-r</strong> is <strong>c-o-l-o-r</strong> in American English. American spelling drops the <strong>u</strong> in words with <strong>o-u</strong> in them. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And there are a lot of words that end in <strong>r-e</strong> in British English but <strong>e-r</strong> in American English, like <strong>theatre</strong>,<strong> centre </strong>and<strong> kilometre</strong>.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>And right now it’s quiz time! Number one: Everybody knows that if you play with fire, you might get burnt. But what are the two possible ways to spell the past participle of the verb <strong>burn</strong>?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>They’re <strong>b-u-r-n-t</strong> and <strong>b-u-r-n-e-d</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br><span>Number two. How do we spell <strong>all right</strong> when it’s one word?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br><span><strong>a-l-r-i-g-h-t</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong></span><span>Number three: What’s the American English spelling of the word <strong>flavour</strong>?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>It's <strong>f-l-a-v-o-r</strong> without the <strong>u</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Well done if you got those all right. And before we go, here’s a vocabulary tip. If you use a computer to write in English, use a spellchecker, and make sure you set it to your preferred variety of English. </span></p>

<p><strong><span>Both<br></span></strong><span>Bye!</span></p><br/><li><p><span>Some words have two possible spellings in British English, for example <strong>analogue, disc, enquire</strong>. Sometimes the second spelling comes from American English.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Disc</strong> can be spelt <strong>d-i-s-c</strong> or <strong>d-i-s-k</strong> for computing terms.</span></p>
<p><span>Some words ending in <strong>-ise</strong> or <strong>-yse</strong> are spelt -<strong>ize</strong> and <strong>-yze</strong> in American English. That spelling is generally accepted in British English too.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>apologise</strong> (BrE) / <strong>apologize</strong> (AmE/BrE)</span></p>
<p><span>The past form of some verbs can be spelt in two ways in British English. But the <strong>-ed</strong> ending is preferred in American English.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Spelled </strong>/<strong> spelt </strong>(BrE) /<strong> spelled </strong>(AmE/BrE)</span></p>
<p><span>Other words have two spellings, not from any American influence.</span></p>

<p><span>Some American English spellings are not accepted as correct in British English. Two common examples are words with <strong>ou</strong> in them and words ending in <strong>-re</strong>.</span></p>

"<p><span>Are you interested in football? Do you know what <strong>FIFA</strong> is and why it’s called that? Or are you more interested in space and <strong>NASA</strong>?&nbsp;Listen to&nbsp;Peter and Catherine talking about acronyms like these in 6 Minute Vocabulary.</span></p><br/>
<p><strong><span>Peter<br></span></strong><span>Hi! I’m Peter.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And I’m Catherine. Welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. And today we’re talking about acronyms. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Peter<br></span></strong><span>Examples of acronyms are the name <strong>FIFA</strong>, that’s the international federation of association football, and <strong>BBC</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>We’ll talk about where these names come from and we'll tell you how we say and write them.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Peter<br></span></strong><span>There will be a quiz of course; and we’ll also bring you a top tip for remembering these words. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Let’s start by listening to James. He’s giving a lecture about the United Nations.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Peter</span><br></strong><span>And while you’re listening: Can you guess where the name <strong>UNESCO</strong> comes from?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<br></span></strong><span><strong>James<br></strong>The United Nations aims to encourage international cooperation and preserve world peace. A number of different organisations are part of it. One of the most well-known is <strong>UNESCO</strong>. That’s the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. But you may also have heard of the <strong>W-H-O</strong>, the <strong>I-M-F</strong>, and the<strong> W-B-G</strong>, for example. Do you know what they are? The <strong>UN</strong> performs most of its work through these different organisations.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Peter</span><br></strong><span>So we asked you: Can you guess where the name <strong>UNESCO</strong> comes from?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And the answer is that it comes from the first letters of the organisation’s full name: <strong>U</strong>nited <strong>N</strong>ations <strong>E</strong>ducational, <strong>S</strong>cientific and <strong>C</strong>ultural <strong>O</strong>rganisation: <strong>UNESCO</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Peter<br></span></strong><span>Now with acronyms like <strong>UNESCO</strong>, we say them as if they are a word: <strong>UNESCO</strong>. We don’t spell out the letters separately. We don't say<strong> U-N-E-S-C-O</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Other acronyms like this that are very well-known are <strong>NATO</strong>, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, and <strong>NASA</strong>, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Peter<br></span></strong><span>That’s easy for you to say. By the way,<strong> FIFA</strong> is a bit of a trick. The acronym actually comes from the French name for the organisation, not the English. Federation Internationale de Football Association.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Nice accent.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Peter<br></span></strong><span>Merci.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>So what about the other acronyms James mentioned? Let’s listen.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br>James&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></strong>… you may also have heard of the <strong>W-H-O</strong>, the <strong>I-M-F</strong>, and the<strong> W-B-G</strong>, for example.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now these next acronyms are a bit different. We spell out the initial letters separately. Can you guess what these letters stand for? <strong>W-H-O</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Peter<br></strong></span><span>That’s the World Health Organisation.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>It is. Now:<strong> I-M-F</strong>...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Peter<br></span></strong><span>It’s the International Monetary Fund.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span><strong>W-B-G</strong>?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Peter<br></span></strong><span>The World Bank Group.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And it’s worth remembering that we&nbsp;usually write both types of acronym with capital letters. Now for another clip.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br>James<br></strong></span><span>The <strong>UN</strong> performs most of its work through these different organisations.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Now it’s interesting that James started off by saying the United Nations. But here he says the <strong>UN</strong>. Why’s that do you think?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Peter<br></span></strong><span>Well, using acronyms saves time and it makes the organisations seem more familiar. With the second type of acronym like <strong>U-N</strong>, where you spell out the letters, we sometimes use the full name the first time we mention the organisation and then, once we’ve done that, we go on to use the acronym as we continue to talk about it.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>OK. But with the first type of acronym like <strong>UNESCO</strong>, where you say it as a word, we nearly always use just the acronym. That’s probably because the full names are often so long that the acronyms have actually&nbsp;become like words to replace them.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Peter<br></span></strong><span>Yes, in fact there are a few words in English that used to be acronyms but have now become ordinary words. These words are not written with capital letters. For example <strong>scuba</strong> as in <strong>scuba diving.</strong> This comes from <strong>s</strong>elf-<strong>c</strong>ontained <strong>u</strong>nderwater <strong>b</strong>reathing <strong>a</strong>pparatus. And <strong>laser</strong> comes from <strong>l</strong>ight <strong>a</strong>mplification by <strong>s</strong>timulated <strong>e</strong>mission of <strong>r</strong>adiation.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Wow, well yes, that is quite a mouthful, isn’t it?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Peter<br></span></strong><span>It certainly does go on…</span></p>
<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Peter</span><br></strong><span>We’re talking about acronyms. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And it’s quiz time! And this time it’s a bit of a general knowledge game because we’re going to see if you know what some popular acronyms stand for. And not all of them are organisations. So number one: <strong>WWW</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Peter<br></span></strong><span>It’s the World Wide Web.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>It is, indeed. Now number two: <strong>RAM</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Peter</span></strong><br><span>That’s Random Access Memory. We use it for a type of computer memory.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>We do. And the last one: <strong>CIA</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Peter<br></span></strong><span>It’s the Central Intelligence Agency in the US.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>It is indeed - and well done if you got them all right. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Peter<br></span></strong><span>And before we go, here’s a vocabulary tip. There are a lot of acronyms in everyday life as well as those that are organisations. For example: <strong>ATM</strong>, <strong>DIY</strong> and <strong>FYI</strong>. We use them all the time. When you see an acronym written in capital letters, check out what it stands for online or find a dictionary. They do make sense and are easy to remember when you know the full name or meaning.</span></p>

"<h3><span>Antonyms</span></h3>
<p><span>Are your clothes a bit <strong>old-fashioned</strong> or are they really <strong>trendy</strong>? Are you a <strong>decisive </strong>or <strong>indecisive </strong>person? </span></p>
<p><span>One good way of building vocabulary in English is to learn words with opposite meanings. We call a pair of words with opposite meanings <strong>antonyms</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Finn&nbsp;and&nbsp;Catherine talk you through this subject in 6 Minute Vocabulary. </span></p><br/>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span> &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I’m Finn…</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br><span>And I’m Catherine. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>In today’s programme, we’re talking about antonyms.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Antonyms are words with opposite meanings.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Like big and small…</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Fat and thin… We’re going to give you lots of examples of antonyms today.&nbsp;And we’ll give you a top tip for improving your vocabulary.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span> &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>So let’s start by listening to someone called Ruth. She's shopping and trying on shoes.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br><span>While you listen, think about this question: what colour are the two pairs of shoes with heels?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<br></span></strong><span><strong>Assistant<br></strong></span><span>Here’s a selection.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Ruth<br></strong></span><span>I’ll try these on first… Hmm – they’re a bit <strong>uncomfortable</strong> – too <strong>tight</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Assistant<br></strong></span><span>OK. Try these. They’re the next size up.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Ruth<br></strong></span><span>Hmm… they’re a little more <strong>comfortable</strong>, but they’re too <strong>wide</strong> at the back and they feel a bit <strong>loose</strong>! I’ve got very <strong>narrow</strong> feet.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Assistant<br></strong></span><span>What about the flat ones?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Ruth<br></strong></span><span>They look a bit <strong>old-fashioned</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Assistant<br></strong></span><span>These <strong>dark</strong> blue ones with the heels are really popular at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Ruth<br></strong></span><span>Yes, they’re quite <strong>trendy</strong>, but I think I prefer the <strong>light blue</strong> ones… Actually, the dark blue ones are quite nice… Oh, I’m so <strong>indecisive</strong>!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br><span>So that was Ruth shopping there. And we asked you: what colours were the two pairs of shoes with heels?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br><span>And the answer is: one pair was <strong>dark</strong> blue and one pair was <strong>light</strong> blue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span><strong>Dark</strong> and <strong>light</strong> are antonyms. Here they’re describing two different shades of blue. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Now we often find antonyms when we are comparing things. So listen to this clip for some more opposites.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 1<br></span></strong><strong><span>Ruth</span></strong><br><span>Hmm – they’re a bit <strong>uncomfortable</strong> – too <strong>tight</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Assistant</span></strong><br><span>OK. Try these – they’re the next size up.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Ruth<br></strong></span><span>They’re a little more <strong>comfortable</strong>, but they’re too <strong>wide</strong> at the back and feel a bit <strong>loose</strong>! I’ve got very <strong>narrow</strong> feet.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>So we had <strong>tight, </strong>spelt<strong> t-i-g-h-t, </strong>meaning fitting too closely.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>And we had the opposite <strong>loose</strong>, spelt <strong>l-o-o-s-e</strong>, meaning not fitting closely.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Ruth also said that one pair of shoes were too <strong>wide </strong>because she’s got <strong>narrow</strong> feet. So <strong>wide</strong>, spelt <strong>w-i-d-e</strong>, means the space from one side to the other is bigger than usual or bigger than comfortable. <strong>Narrow</strong>, spelt <strong>n-a-r-r-o-w</strong>, means the opposite – the space from one side to the other is smaller than usual or smaller than comfortable.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>There were two other words that are opposites – <strong>comfortable</strong> and <strong>uncomfortable</strong>. The difference between these two words is just two letters <strong>u</strong> and <strong>n</strong>, which form the prefix <strong>un</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And in English we often use the prefixes <strong>un, in</strong> (spelt <strong>i-n</strong>) and <strong>dis </strong>(spelt <strong>d-i-s</strong>) to make antonyms. If we put one of these prefixes at the start of the word, it can change the meaning of the word to its opposite.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>So Ruth said that she was <strong>indecisive</strong>. By adding the prefix <strong>in</strong> (<strong>i-n</strong>) to the word <strong>decisive</strong>, which means being able to make decisions easily, we make <strong>indecisive</strong>, which has the opposite meaning – not being able to make decisions easily. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>What are you Finn?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>I’m a little indecisive, I must say.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Are you sure about that? Not really?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Very good.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Let’s have another short clip with two more antonyms. Can you spot them?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br></strong></span><span><strong>Assistant<br></strong></span><span>What about the flat ones?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Ruth<br></strong></span><span>They look a bit <strong>old-fashioned</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Assistant<br></strong></span><span>These dark blue ones with the heels are really popular at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Ruth<br></strong></span><span>Yes, they’re quite <strong>trendy</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>So we had <strong>old-fashioned</strong> and <strong>trendy</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>You describe something as <strong>old-fashioned</strong> when it looks like it’s from a time in the past. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Whereas something that is <strong>trendy</strong> is modern, up-to-date or cool.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br><span>And we’re talking about antonyms, which are words with opposite meanings.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>The prefixes <strong>un</strong>, <strong>in</strong> and <strong>dis</strong> are often used to make antonyms, for example: <strong>decisive</strong> and<strong> indecisive</strong>. Now all the words we’ve seen earlier are adjectives, but other parts of speech can be antonyms.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>So you can have verbs, like <strong>ask</strong> and <strong>answer</strong>…</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Which is what we’re going to do now because it’s time for a quiz. So, what is the opposite of the word tight: is it a) loose or b) narrow?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>The answer is a) <strong>loose</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Well done if you got that right. Number two: trendy. Is the opposite a) modern or b) old-fashioned?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>It’s b) <strong>old-fashioned</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>That’s correct! And number three: comfortable. Is the opposite a) discomfortable or b) uncomfortable? </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And the answer is b)<strong> uncomfortable</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br><span>And that’s the end of the quiz – so well done if you got them all right.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br><span>And now here’s today’s top tip for learning vocabulary: when you learn a new word, have a look in the dictionary to see if there is a prefix that will help you make the opposite word. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong></span><span>Yes, and that way you can get two words for the price of one!</span></p>

"<h3><strong>Suffixes: -ness &amp; -ity</strong></h3>
<p>Is <strong>responsibility</strong> the key to <strong>happiness</strong> at work - or can it lead to <strong>illness</strong>? Listen to Neil and Catherine talk about words with the suffixes <strong>-ness</strong> and <strong>-ity</strong> in this 6 Minute Vocabulary programme. Listen to more examples and have a go at our quiz!</p><br/>
<p><strong>Neil</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Neil…</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br>And I'm Catherine. And it's very good to see you back at work today, Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Thanks, it's nice to be back. I hate being off sick.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>We've missed you... we have missed you. And there has been a lot of sickness in the office this week, and <strong>sickness</strong> is one of the words that we're looking at in today's show.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes. Today we're talking about the suffixes <strong>-ness</strong> and <strong>-ity</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>In the world of vocabulary, suffixes are two or three letters at the end of a word. They can tell you what type of word it is. The suffix <strong>-ness</strong>, spelt<strong> n-e-s-s</strong>, at the end of the word <strong>sickness</strong> tells you that the word is a noun, which comes from the adjective <strong>sick</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>In this programme we'll give you lots more examples of words with the suffix <strong>-ness</strong> and also we'll find about the suffix <strong>-ity</strong>, spelt <strong>i-t-y</strong>...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right. And we'll have a quiz...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>...and we'll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary. So let's get started by hearing from Arjuna. And he's talking about how he feels about being a nurse.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>While you listen, think about this question: How does Arjuna often feel at the end of the day?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Arjuna<br></strong>I have a lot of <strong>responsibility</strong>. Sometimes it's upsetting, like telling someone there's a <strong>possibility</strong> they have a serious <strong>illness</strong>. The hours are long and <strong>tiredness</strong> can be a problem at the end of the day. But the rewards are there too, like the <strong>happiness</strong> of a mother holding her newborn baby. And of course there are the cards and gifts - I'm always touched by the <strong>kindness</strong> and <strong>generosity</strong> of the patients.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>So we asked you: How does Arjuna feel at the end of the day?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br>And the answer is: he feels tired. In fact, he says that '<strong>tiredness</strong> can be a problem'.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>The word <strong>tiredness</strong> comes from the adjective <strong>tired</strong>. Nouns with the suffix <strong>–ness</strong>, spelt&nbsp;<strong>n-e-s-s</strong>, like <strong>tiredness</strong>, describe the feeling or state of the original adjective.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>So <strong>tired – ness </strong>is the feeling of being tired.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Exactly.<strong> Ill – ness</strong> is the state of being ill. <strong>Sick – ness</strong>, which we heard at the start of the programme, is the state of being <strong>sick</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Poor you, Neil. Let's hear some more examples of this suffix.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Arjuna<br></strong>But the rewards are there too, like the <strong>happiness</strong> of a mother holding her newborn baby. And of course there are the cards and gifts - I'm always touched by the <strong>kindness</strong> and <strong>generosity</strong> of the patients.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>So we had <strong>happiness</strong>...</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>...from the adjective <strong>happy</strong>...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And <strong>kindness</strong>...</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>...from the adjective <strong>kind</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>In <strong>kindness</strong>, the suffix <strong>-ness</strong> makes a noun that is a quality. The suffix <strong>-ity</strong>, spelt<strong> i-t-y</strong>, which we heard in the word <strong>generosity </strong>there, also changes an adjective into a quality.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Generosity</strong> comes from the adjective generous. It means: the willingness to give things.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And Arjuna thinks his&nbsp;patients are generous because they give the nurses cards and gifts. Let's hear some more words with the suffix <strong>-ity</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Arjuna<br></strong>I have a lot of <strong>responsibility</strong>. Sometimes it's upsetting, like telling someone there's a <strong>possibility</strong> they have a serious <strong>illness</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>We had <strong>responsibility</strong>, which comes from the adjective<strong> responsible</strong>. It means: being in charge of someone or something, or making sure certain things happen.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>We also heard <strong>possibility</strong>, which comes from the adjective<strong> possible</strong> and means that something might happen.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And we're talking about the suffixes <strong>-</strong><strong>ness </strong>and<strong> -ity</strong>, which change adjectives into nouns.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Great. Now it's time for a quiz. Choose the correct word. Ready? Number one. Mr Smith will not be attending the meeting, due to a) illity &nbsp;b) illness &nbsp;c) ill.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And the answer is b)<strong> illness</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Number two. To succeed in high-level management, you have to accept a lot of a) responsibleness &nbsp;b) responsity &nbsp;c) responsibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And the answer is c) <strong>responsibility</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Number three. Listening to 6 Minute Vocabulary whilst drinking a glass of wine at the end of the day brings me a lot of a) happiness &nbsp;b) happity &nbsp;c) happinessity.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And the answer is a) <strong>happiness</strong>, of course!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br>That's right. And that's the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them all right.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>And now, here's today's top tip for learning vocabulary: when you come across a word that you don't know, look to see if you can work out the root of the word - if there is a prefix or a suffix that you know, it will help you to understand the meaning.</p>

"<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Hello! Welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Finn.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And I'm Catherine. Today we're talking about words and phrases that we use to express our attitude to what we're saying or writing.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>So two common examples are <strong>fortunately</strong>, which shows I'm pleased, and <strong>I'm afraid, </strong>which shows I'm sorry about something. So let's start by listening to Rob. He's talking about electric cars. Are you a fan of the electric car, Catherine?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>I'm not a fan of any kind of&nbsp;car actually, Finn. If I had one I would probably consider electric.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Very environmentally considerate of you.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thank you. And before we hear from Rob, here's a question: What is Rob's attitude towards public transport and bicycles? Here he is:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Rob<br></strong></span><span><strong>I must admit</strong> I'm not sure about the whole idea of electric cars. I mean <strong>obviously</strong> we need to find alternative forms of energy, but <strong>if you ask me</strong>, reducing the numbers of cars on the road should be the priority. <strong>Ideally</strong> we would all use public transport or bicycles. <strong>Seriously</strong>, I think people should be given tax breaks if they don't own a car! But <strong>of course</strong> that's not going to happen any time soon.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong>So Rob's attitude is that <strong>ideally</strong> we would all use public transport or bicycles.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Or to put that another way, he thinks it would be ideal if we all used public transport or bicycles. By beginning the sentence with <strong>ideally</strong>, Rob expresses his attitude nicely in just&nbsp;one word. Right. Let's listen for more words and phrases that shows Rob's attitude in this clip.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>INSERT<br></strong></span><strong>Rob &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong><strong>I must admit</strong> I'm not sure about the whole idea of electric cars. I mean <strong>obviously</strong> we need to find alternative forms of energy, but <strong>if you ask me,</strong> reducing the numbers of cars on the road should be the priority.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>So he begins with the phrase <strong>I must admit</strong>... Now what does that tell us? </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Well, we usually use that expression when we're going to say something that might be unpopular. Perhaps we're a little embarrassed to say it.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Yes, Rob knows that a lot of people are keen on the idea of electric cars, but he's going to say something different.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>That's right. Then Rob used the word <strong>obviously</strong>. People use <strong>obviously</strong> to show that an idea is easy to see or understand.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>And by using it here, Rob means that the need for alternative forms of energy is clear to him, even though he has other ideas on the subject too.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Exactly. Because he then said <strong>if you ask me</strong>, reducing the numbers of cars on the road should be the priority.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>So this phrase:<strong> if you ask me - </strong>it's like<strong> in my opinion</strong>, isn't it?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>It is, but it tells us more about the speaker's attitude. It's less direct than <strong>in my opinion</strong>, and it shows that Rob realises that other people might disagree. Let's have another clip.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>INSERT<br>Rob<br></strong></span><span><strong>Seriously</strong>, I think people should be given tax breaks if they don't own a car! </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong></span><span><strong>Seriously.</strong> Now why does he use that word&nbsp;here?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span><strong>Seriously</strong> shows that Rob knows that his idea might sound like a joke to some people. But he wants to make it clear that it's not a joke.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Oh yes, people often use it when they have been joking and they want to start being serious, don't they?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Yes, they do. Right, listen again:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>INSERT<br>Rob<br></strong></span><span>But <strong>of course</strong> that's not going to happen any time soon.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong>Well, <strong>of course</strong> is a very familiar expression. Now here Rob uses it to show his understanding of the real situation. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Does it also sound slightly critical of the government?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes, I think it does. He's not expecting any new government policies that will change the situation on the roads.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong>And we're talking about words and phrases that show attitude. <strong>Obviously,</strong> they are very important for expressing yourself and understanding what other people mean!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>That's right. But <strong>I'm afraid</strong> they can be tricky to define in a dictionary, can't they, Finn?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Yes, they can. In fact you can often only understand their real meaning from the context that they are in.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>That's right. And it's nearly the end of the show so obviously it's time for a quiz! So question one: Which is correct? a) I must admit I haven't done much work today or b) If you ask me, I haven't done much work today.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>That's a) <strong>I must admit</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Correct. Good. Now question two: a) Ideally, the weather will affect our plans for the day or b) Obviously, the weather will affect our plans for the day.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br><span>And that one is b) <strong>obviously</strong>. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Correct. And question three: a) OK, but seriously, what do you really think? b) OK, but of course, what do you really think? </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong></span><span>And this time it's a) <strong>seriously</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Yes it is. And well done if you got those right at home.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>And now, here's a game you can play with&nbsp;a friend to help you practise these words and phrases. Have a conversation with them and try to use as many of these words and phrases as you can. Give yourself a point each time you manage to do it.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Both<br></span></strong><span>Bye!</span></p><br/><p><strong>Fortunately =&nbsp;</strong>I'm pleased<br><strong>Fortunately,</strong> there wasn't much traffic on the roads.</p>
<p><strong>I'm afraid&nbsp;= </strong>I'm sorry<br><strong>I'm afraid</strong> I forgot to buy any bread.</p>

"<h3>Suffixes: -ment, -ance, -ence</h3>
<p>Words like <strong>excitement</strong>, <strong>performance</strong> and <strong>difference</strong> have suffixes that turn verbs and adjectives into nouns. Listen to Finn and Catherine talk about the suffixes <strong>-ment</strong>, <strong>-ence</strong> and <strong>-ance</strong> in this 6 Minute Vocabulary.</p><br/>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I’m Catherine…</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>And I’m Finn. Today we’re talking about suffixes.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>A suffix is a group of letters at the end of a word, which can tell you what kind of word it is. In today’s programme we’re looking at <strong>-ment, </strong>spelt<strong> m-e-n-t, -ance</strong> spelt<strong> a-n-c-e, </strong>and </span><span><strong>-ence, </strong>spelt <strong>e-n-c-e</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>The last two sound quite similar, don't they? </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>They do.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br><span><strong>-ance</strong> and <strong>-ence</strong>. But first, let’s hear from Tania. She loves to dance. She’s talking about her recent visit to the ballet.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>That's right. While you listen, think about this question: Did Tania enjoy the ballet in the end?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<br></span></strong><span>There was huge <strong>excitement</strong> in the audience. This was the Bolshoi’s only <strong>performance</strong> of Swan Lake in London. But at half past seven a man appeared and made an <strong>announcement</strong>. He thanked us for our <strong>patience</strong> and then said that the lead dancer was ill and couldn’t <strong>perform</strong>. In the <strong>silence</strong> that followed, you could feel everyone’s <strong>disappointment</strong>. But the <strong>replacement </strong>dancer was wonderful. She wasn’t too <strong>confident</strong> to start with, but her <strong>confidence</strong> grew and, in the end, the lead dancer’s <strong>absence</strong> didn’t lessen my <strong>enjoyment </strong>at all. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br><span>So we asked you: Did Tania enjoy the ballet in the end?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong></span><span>And the answer was: Yes, she did. The lead dancer’s <strong>absence</strong> didn’t lessen her <strong>enjoyment.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And <strong>absence</strong> and <strong>enjoyment</strong> are two key words in this programme. The noun <strong>absence</strong> with the suffix <strong>-ence</strong>, spelt <strong>e-n-c-e,</strong> means someone or something not being there. It comes from the adjective <strong>absent</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>…and the noun <strong>enjoyment</strong> with the suffix <strong>-ment</strong> comes from the verb <strong>enjoy</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Let’s listen to a clip with more words with <strong>-ment</strong> and <strong>-ence, </strong>spelt<strong> e-n-c-e</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 1<br></span></strong><span>In the <strong>silence</strong> that followed, you could feel everyone’s <strong>disappointment</strong>. But the <strong>replacement </strong>dancer was wonderful. She wasn’t too <strong>confident</strong> to start with, but her <strong>confidence</strong> grew.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>So we had two nouns with the suffix <strong>-ence</strong>,spelt<strong> e-n-c-e</strong>:<strong> silence</strong> and <strong>confidence</strong>. The noun <strong>silence</strong> comes from the adjective <strong>silent</strong>,meaning complete quiet.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>…and the noun <strong>confidence</strong>, which comes from the adjective <strong>confident</strong>, means having belief in your own abilities. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Notice that both adjectives end in the letter <strong>t</strong>, which changes to a letter <strong>c</strong> in the suffix <strong>-</strong><strong>ence</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>So<strong> silent</strong> becomes <strong>sil-ence</strong>…</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>…and <strong>confident</strong> becomes <strong>confid-ence</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Other common adjectives ending in the letter <strong>t</strong> that add <strong>e-n-c-e</strong> are: <strong>independent </strong>and<strong> different</strong>…</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong></span><span>…which become <strong>independence </strong>and<strong> difference.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>In the clip, we also heard two more words with the suffix <strong>-ment</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Yes, we heard <strong>disappointment, </strong>which comes from the verb <strong>disappoint</strong>, meaning a feeling of being unhappy because you have been let down.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>…and <strong>replacement</strong>, which comes from the verb <strong>replace</strong> and means a thing or person which takes the place of something or someone else. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Now, let’s hear another clip. Listen out for two words with the suffixes<strong> -ance</strong> with an <strong>a</strong> and <strong>-ence </strong>with an <strong>e</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 2<br></span></strong><span>There was huge <strong>excitement</strong> in the audience. This was the Bolshoi’s only <strong>performance</strong> of Swan Lake in London. But at half past seven a man appeared and made an <strong>announcement</strong>. He thanked us for our <strong>patience</strong> and then said that the lead dancer was ill and couldn’t perform.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>So we had the noun <strong>performance</strong>, spelt <strong>a-n-c-e </strong>at the end, which comes from the verb <strong>perform</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And we had <strong>patience</strong>, spelt<strong> e-n-c-e </strong>at the end, from the adjective <strong>patient</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Did you spot the two words with the suffix <strong>–ment</strong>? <strong>Excitement </strong>from the verb <strong>excite</strong>…</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>…and <strong>announcement </strong>from the verb <strong>announce</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>BBC Learning English dot com.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Now, time for a quiz. And ready for number one? Is the word <strong>silence</strong> spelt a) s-i-l-e-n-c-e or b) s-i-l-a-n-c-e? </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>It’s a) s-i-l-e-n-c-e.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Very good. Number two: What’s the noun that comes from the verb <strong>replace?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>It's <strong>replacement.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And, number three: Complete this sentence: Maria lacks a) confident or b) confidence?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>It's b)<strong> confidence. </strong>And that’s the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them all right.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br><span>And now, here’s today’s top tip for learning vocabulary: choose a word and then think of all the different forms of that word, so think of a noun, adjective and verb all with the same root.</span></p>

"<h3>Verbs, verbs, verbs</h3>
<p>In this programme we look at the difficult subject of irregular verbs: verbs that don't behave normally.&nbsp;Unfortunately, not all verbs take <strong>-ed </strong>in the&nbsp;past and perfect tenses.&nbsp;For example, look at what happens to the verb <strong>choose </strong>in the past simple and present perfect:</p>
<ul>
<li>I <strong>chose</strong> a black dress last time (past simple)</li>
<li>I've <strong>chosen</strong> a black dress again (present perfect)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Note: Past participle</h3>
<p>In the last sentence, the word <strong>chosen</strong> is what we call the <strong>past participle</strong>. The past participle is used in the present perfect (I have chosen), the past perfect (I had chosen), passives (it is chosen) and adjectives (the chosen one).</p>
<h3>To do</h3>
<p>Listen to this episode of 6 Minute Vocabulary.&nbsp;In the programme, Mike says his phone is missing. But who <strong>took</strong> it?&nbsp;Mike thinks Neil has <strong>taken</strong> it. Is Mike right?</p><br/>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Catherine.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br><span>And I'm Finn. Actually Catherine, sorry I'm late. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br><span>You should be.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br><span>It's <strong>taken</strong> me forever to get here! </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br><span>I know.</span></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong><span>The bus <strong>took</strong> hours. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Oh did it really, Finn? But you usually <strong>take</strong> the train.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>I missed it today. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>OK, no problem. Because actually, Finn, you've introduced today's topic with the words:&nbsp;<strong>take, took, taken</strong>...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Ah yes, irregular verbs.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>That's right. We're going to look at three different groups of irregular verbs. So, let's start by listening to Mike and Neil's conversation. And poor Mike can't find his phone.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Oh no. While you listen, think about this question: How many times has Abdullah rung?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<br></span></strong><span><strong>Mike<br></strong>Have you <strong>seen</strong> my phone, Neil?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, I haven't <strong>taken </strong>it. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Mike<br></strong>I didn't <strong>say</strong> you <strong>'took'</strong> it. I just <strong>said</strong> 'Have you <strong>seen</strong> it?'</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>I <strong>saw</strong> it on your desk this morning.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Mike<br></strong>I can't <strong>see</strong> it here! I've got to <strong>ring</strong> Abdullah. He <strong>rang </strong>again today. He<strong>'s rung </strong>me five times this week... &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>I'll ring it for you - I'll just get my phone... out... of... my pocket... Oh, this is your phone! You <strong>put </strong>it on my desk by mistake... So, where have I <strong>put</strong> my phone? I always <strong>put</strong> it in my pocket...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br><span>So we asked you: How many times has Abdullah rung this week?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br><span>And the answer is: five. He's <strong>rung</strong> five times this week.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span><strong>Ring... rang... rung</strong>. So, the past simple of <strong>ring</strong> is <strong>rang</strong>, and the past participle is <strong>rung</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>There are several irregular verbs like <strong>ring</strong>, with different forms for the base verb, past simple and past participle.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br></strong>The verb <strong>take</strong>, for example, which we had earlier. Listen out for it in this clip.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 1<br></span></strong><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, I haven't <strong>taken </strong>it. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Mike<br></strong>I didn't <strong>say</strong> you <strong>'took'</strong> it. I just <strong>said</strong> 'Have you <strong>seen</strong> it?'</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br></strong>I <strong>saw</strong> it on your desk this morning.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Mike<br></strong>I can't <strong>see</strong> it here!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>So the verb <strong>take</strong> changes to <strong>took</strong> in the past simple...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>...and <strong>taken</strong> in the past participle.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>We also heard <strong>see, saw </strong>and<strong> seen.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>...three different forms again. <strong>See</strong> is the main verb, <strong>saw</strong> is the past simple...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>...and <strong>seen</strong> is the past participle.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br></strong></span><span>Other verbs that follow this pattern are <strong>write, wrote, written</strong>...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>...<strong>break, broke, broken</strong>...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>...<strong>speak, spoke, spoken</strong>...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>...and <strong>choose, chose, chosen</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Good. Now, in the clip we also heard <strong>say</strong> and <strong>said.</strong> The verb <strong>say </strong>belongs to a different group of irregular verbs.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Yes, verbs in this group have just two different forms. For example, with <strong>say, said, said,</strong> the past simple and the past participle are the same.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Other verbs in this second group are: </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span><strong>Tell, told, told; have</strong>, <strong>had</strong>, <strong>had; lose</strong>, <strong>lost</strong>, <strong>lost</strong>...</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br></strong></span><span>...<strong>meet, met,</strong> <strong>met; find, found, found</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Very good. Now, in the third group of irregular verbs we are looking at today, all three forms are the same. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Listen to this clip and see if you can spot an example.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<strong><br></strong></span></strong><span><strong>Neil</strong><br>Oh, this is your phone. You <strong>put </strong>it on my desk by mistake... So, where have I <strong>put</strong> my phone? I always <strong>put</strong> it in my pocket...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>So, we had <strong>put, put, put -</strong> all three forms are exactly the same.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Other verbs in this group include <strong>cut, cut, cut; let, let, let</strong> and <strong>shut, shut, shut</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>You’re listening to bbclearningenglish.com </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And we're talking about three different groups of irregular verbs. In one group, the verb is the same in all three forms, like <strong>put</strong>, <strong>put</strong>,<strong> put</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>In another group the verb is the same in two of its forms, like <strong>say, said, said</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>...and in the third, and biggest group, all three forms are different, like <strong>take, took, taken</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>And now, it's quiz time! Question one. What are the three forms of the verb <strong>shut</strong> – as in <strong>shut the door</strong>?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And the answer is<strong> shut, shut, shut.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>That's right. Number two. What are the three forms of the verb <strong>find</strong> - as in <strong>find some money</strong>?&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And the answer is<strong> find, found, found</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>And number three: Which of these verbs is different in all three forms: a) <strong>have</strong>, b) <strong>choose</strong> or c) <strong>let</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></span></strong>And the answer is b) choose, chose, chosen. The others are a) <strong>have, had, had</strong> and c) is <strong>let, let, let</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br><span>And that's the end of the quiz, quiz, quiz. Well done if you got them right.</span></p>

"<h3>Easily confused words</h3>
<p><strong>Sensible </strong>and <strong>sensitive </strong>are two words that look and sound similar but have very different meanings. They are often confused in English. Find out more about words that are easily confused in this 6 minute Vocabulary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><br/>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Catherine…</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And I'm Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Neil, like your hat!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Thank you very much. It's cold outside, so I thought it would be <strong>sensible </strong>to wear a woolly hat.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>My ears are very <strong>sensitive</strong> to the cold.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>I've noticed your ears looking a little bit red of a morning, occasionally, Neil. And the words <strong>sensible</strong> and <strong>sensitive </strong>are good examples of today's topic. The two words look and sound similar, but they have very different meanings. And in this programme we're going to talk about more pairs of words that people sometimes get mixed up.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Now let's now hear about Mike. He was in a shop yesterday when he made a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Think about this question while you listen: What mistake did Mike make in the shop?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong>Mike felt <strong>bored</strong>. He was watching a <strong>boring</strong> film about plants in the <strong>desert</strong>. 'I know – I'll make a cake', he thought. 'We'll have it for <strong>dessert</strong>'. The <strong>recipe</strong> looked easy – just a few <strong>ingredients</strong>. But when Mike checked the <strong>contents</strong> of his cupboard, there wasn't any sugar. He went to the shop and bought some. The cake looked great. But it tasted horrible. Mike checked the <strong>receipt</strong>. He'd bought salt by mistake!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>So we asked you: What mistake did Mike make in the shop?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And the answer is: He bought salt instead of sugar.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, the <strong>receipt</strong> said 'salt' but the <strong>recipe, </strong>of course, said 'sugar'.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>The nouns <strong>receipt </strong>and <strong>recipe </strong>look very similar, but they have different meanings. A <strong>receipt</strong>, r – e – c – e – i – p – t, is a document that shows you have paid money for something.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, and a <strong>recipe</strong>, r – e – c – i – p – e, is a set of cooking instructions.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Listen to a clip from Mike's story. Can you spot two more confusing words?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br></strong>He was watching a boring film about plants in the <strong>desert</strong>. 'I know – I'll make a cake', he thought. 'We'll have it for <strong>dessert</strong>'.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So that's<strong> desert</strong> and <strong>dessert</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yep. Now a <strong>desert </strong>is an area of land where very little can grow and there's very little water. <strong>Desert, </strong>d – e – s – e – r – t, has one 's', but <strong>dessert</strong>, d – e – s – s – e – r – t, has two 's'. A <strong>dessert</strong> is a sweet food course that we eat at the end of a meal. Right. Moving on. Neil, what do you do when you are <strong>bored</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well I find making cakes <strong>boring</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Really?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yeah. When I'm <strong>bored</strong>, I knit. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>You knit?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Of course - the hat! The woolly hat!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, I knitted this woolly hat.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>It's fantastic!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Bored</strong> and <strong>boring</strong> – both adjectives, but with very different meanings.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>Bored</strong>, b – o – r – e – d, describes how someone is feeling, when they are not interested in something. <strong>Boring</strong>, b – o – r – i – n – g, describes a thing that is not very interesting. Right. Let's have another clip.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br></strong>The recipe looked easy – just a few <strong>ingredients</strong>. But when Mike checked the <strong>contents</strong> of his cupboard, there wasn't any sugar.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>The words <strong>ingredients </strong>and <strong>contents</strong> both mean things that are a part of something else. Individual <strong>ingredients</strong> are things that we put together to make something, usually food – a cake for example. <strong>Contents </strong>are all the separate items inside something like a box or a cupboard.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT<br></strong>6 Minute Vocabulary, from bbclearningenglish.com.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And we're talking about confusing words.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And it's time for a quiz. Choose the correct word. Number one: I can't eat ice cream. My teeth are too… Is it a) sensible or b) sensitive?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And it's b)<strong> sensitive</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well done if you got that right. Number two: Very little rain falls in the… &nbsp;Is it a) desert or b) dessert?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answer is a)<strong> desert</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And number three: I had to wait an hour for my appointment – I got really …. Is it a) boring or b) bored?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answer is b) <strong>bored</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And that's the end of the quiz – well done if you got them right.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And it's almost the end of the programme.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>But before we go, here's today's top tip for learning vocabulary: say new words out loud as you learn them - the word stress will help you to remember which is the correct word to use if you are not so sure.</p>

"<h3><strong>Suffixes: -less &amp; -free</strong></h3>
<p>Are e-cigarettes <strong>harmless</strong> or do you think all public places should be <strong>smoke-free</strong>? Catherine and Neil listen to a politician and talk about the suffixes <strong>-</strong><strong>free</strong> and <strong>-less</strong> in this episode of 6 Minute Vocabulary.</p><br/>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp; <br> Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Catherine...</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br> And I'm Neil. Today we're looking at the suffixes <strong>-</strong><strong>less </strong>and<strong> -</strong><strong>free.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Suffixes are two or three letters at the end of a word that affect its meaning.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>We'll look at what the suffixes <strong>-free</strong> and <strong>-less</strong> mean and give you some examples...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>There'll be a quiz...</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>...and we'll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Let's start by listening to Markus. He's a politician and he's talking about his party's policies.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Right. So while you listen, think about this question: Do e-cigarettes produce smoke? Here's Markus.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT</strong><br><strong>Markus<br></strong>We're focusing on the <strong>jobless</strong>, the <strong>homeless</strong>, the sick and the elderly - people who are <strong>powerless</strong> to change things for themselves. We're campaigning for more <strong>car-free</strong> and <strong>smoke-free</strong> zones. We're going to extend the smoking ban to include e-cigarettes, which may be <strong>smokeless</strong>, but they aren't <strong>harmless</strong>, and we're going to raise the penalties for <strong>careless</strong> drivers.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br> So we asked you: Do e-cigarettes produce smoke?</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br> And the answer is: No they don't. E-cigarettes are <strong>smokeless</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And<strong> smokeless </strong>is a key word in this programme because it ends with the suffix<strong> less, </strong>spelt<strong> l-e-s-s. </strong>This means 'without'.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So <strong>smokeless</strong> cigarettes are cigarettes without smoke - they don't produce any smoke.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And if something is <strong>harmless</strong>, it doesn't cause harm. Markus said that e-cigarettes are not <strong>harmless</strong>. In other words, they are dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Markus also said his party was going to raise penalties - or increase punishments - for <strong>careless </strong>drivers - people who drive without care.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, <strong>careless </strong>means not being careful.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So, by adding <strong>-less</strong> to the nouns <strong>smoke, harm </strong>and<strong> care,</strong> we turn them into adjectives. Let's hear some more examples with <strong>-less</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Markus<br></strong>We're focusing on the <strong>jobless</strong>, the <strong>homeless</strong>, the sick and the elderly - people who are <strong>powerless</strong> to change things for themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So we had the <strong>jobless</strong>...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's people without jobs...</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>...the <strong>homeless</strong>...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>...people who have nowhere to live. We can create a noun to describe a particular group of people, by using the word <strong>the</strong> with a <strong>&shy;-less</strong> word. <strong>The jobless</strong>, <strong>the homeless</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Lastly, we had the adjective<strong> powerless, </strong>which describes people who are unable to do certain things. If we add <strong>the</strong>, we get a group noun: <strong>the powerless</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Let's have another clip. Listen out for the suffix <strong>-free.</strong></p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Markus<br></strong>We're campaigning for more <strong>car-free</strong> and <strong>smoke-free</strong> zones.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>We had <strong>car-free</strong> and <strong>smoke-free</strong>. Now if you add <strong>-free</strong> to a noun, you get an adjective, meaning that there isn't any of that noun, or it's not allowed, or both. <strong>Car-free </strong>means there are no cars because they're not allowed. <strong>Smoke-free</strong> means smoking is not allowed and so there is no smoke.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> 6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And we're talking about the suffixes <strong>-</strong><strong>free </strong>and <strong>-</strong><strong>less</strong>. And Neil how was your journey to work today; <strong>stress-free</strong>, I hope?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>No, actually, it was awful! I tried to use my <strong>contactless </strong>credit card to pay for the train, but it didn't work, so I had to walk all the way...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Oh, won't do you any harm, Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>No. It's good for me, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>It is. And <strong>contactless</strong> credit cards are the cards that work without a PIN number.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Usually you use either <strong>-</strong><strong>free</strong> or <strong>-</strong><strong>less</strong> with a particular word. But occasionally you can use&nbsp;<strong>-free</strong> and <strong>-</strong><strong>less</strong> interchangeably, as in <strong>sugarless</strong> and <strong>sugar-free. </strong>These both mean: without sugar.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>But be very careful with the words <strong>careless</strong> and <strong>carefree </strong>because they have very different meanings.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, they do. A<strong> careless </strong>person is someone who doesn't take much care over what they're doing...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>...whereas a<strong> carefree </strong>person like you, Neil, doesn't worry about anything.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>No, I don't worry about a thing.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now, it's time for a quiz. Choose the correct word. Ready? Number one: Jack looks scary, but he's actually very kind and gentle. He's a) careless b) harmless c) powerless.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And the answer is b) <strong>harmless</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Number two. Dalya doesn't check her work properly so she makes lots of mistakes. She's very a) careless&nbsp; b) carefree&nbsp; c) contactless.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And the answer is a)<strong> careless</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Number three: To cut the risk of cancer, some people smoke e-cigarettes which are a) smokeless b) smokeless-free c) smoke-free.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And the answer is a) <strong>smokeless.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br> And that's the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them right.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br> And now, here's today's top tip for learning vocabulary: record yourself saying new words and then listen to them every day.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Prefixes – or prefixes, as some people say - are two or three letters that go at the beginning of a word and affect its meaning.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>We’ll look at what each prefix means and give you example sentences…</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>There’ll be a quiz …</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>…and we’ll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>But first, let’s listen to Gladys talking about her husband Bert.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>While you listen, think about this question: Does Gladys agree with Bert’s doctor?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<br></span></strong><strong><span>Gladys<br></span></strong><span>Bert’s <strong>dyspepsia</strong>, or indigestion, is quite bad at the moment. It’s causing him quite a bit of <strong>discomfort</strong>. The doctor says it’s because he eats too much fatty food. She says the symptoms would <strong>disappear</strong> if Bert went on a <strong>detox</strong> diet. No <strong>disrespect </strong>to the doctor, but I <strong>disagree</strong> - I think it’s caused by stress. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><br><span>So we asked you: Does Gladys agree with the doctor?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br><span>And the answer is: No, she <strong>disagrees. </strong>Gladys thinks her husband’s indigestion is caused by stress, but the doctor thinks it’s due to a bad diet.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span><strong>Disagree</strong> is the key word because it has the prefix <strong>dis</strong>, spelt <strong>d-i-s</strong>. This means not. So by adding <strong>dis,</strong> we can turn a word into its opposite. So <strong>dis - agree</strong> means not to agree …</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>…and <strong>dis - respect</strong> means not having respect.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Gladys says <strong>No disrespect to the doctor </strong>– meaning she doesn’t want people to think she doesn’t respect what the doctor says<strong>.</strong> Let’s hear another clip from Gladys with more prefixes.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 1<br></span></strong><span>Bert’s <strong>dyspepsia</strong>, or indigestion, is quite bad at the moment. It’s causing him quite a bit of <strong>discomfort</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>So we had <strong>discomfort. </strong>If you know what the word <strong>comfort</strong> means…</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>… then you can work out what <strong>discomfort </strong>means: <strong>dis-</strong> plus <strong>comfort</strong> &nbsp;give us the opposite of comfort: Bert’s feeling uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>And in the clip, we heard the word <strong>dyspepsia</strong> – that’s the medical word for indigestion, when your stomach feels very full and uncomfortable after you eat.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>This word starts with the prefix <strong>dys</strong>, but this time it’s spelt <strong>d-y-s</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>This prefix is less common than <strong>dis</strong>,spelt<strong> d-i-s</strong>, but it also has a negative meaning – it has the idea of being bad or abnormal.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>So <strong>dyspepsia </strong>is a medical condition when your body can’t process food in the normal way.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Other words with the prefix <strong>dys-</strong> , spelt <strong>d-y-s</strong>, are <strong>dyslexia </strong>and <strong>dysfunctional. </strong>People who have <strong>dyslexia</strong> have difficulty with reading…</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>… and if something is <strong>dysfunctional</strong>, it doesn’t work properly.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Let’s have another clip with the prefix <strong>dis-</strong>, <strong>d-i-s</strong>. We’ll also hear our next prefix.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT CLIP 2<br></span></strong><span>She says the symptoms would <strong>disappear</strong> if Bert went on a <strong>detox</strong> diet. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>So, we had <strong>disappear</strong> - that’s <strong>dis-</strong> plus <strong>appear</strong>…</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Yes, and <strong>disappear</strong>, means the opposite of <strong>appear.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>We also had the word <strong>detox</strong>, which starts with the prefix <strong>de-</strong>, spelt <strong>d-e</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Yes, the prefix <strong>de-</strong>,spelt<strong> d-e</strong>, usually means take away or remove something …</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>So, if something is described as a <strong>detox</strong>, <strong>de-tox</strong>, it means it takes away toxins or poisons. A <strong>detox</strong> diet could be one with just fruit and vegetables.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>I like to <strong>detox</strong> at the end of the day with a hot bath.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>6 Minute Vocabulary from the BBC.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And we’re talking about the prefixes<strong> dis-</strong>,spelt<strong> d-i-s</strong>;<strong> dys</strong>,spelt <strong>d-y-s</strong>; and<strong> de-</strong>, spelt <strong>d-e</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>All these prefixes have a negative meaning.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And now it’s quiz time. Choose the correct word. Number one: One minute the dogs were playing in the garden. The next minute the garden was empty and they’d all a) disagreed b) disappeared c) detoxed.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Well, the answer to that is b) <strong>disappeared</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Number two. People who drink too much alcohol sometimes go to a clinic for a a) dyspepsia b) discomfort c) detox.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>The answer is c) <strong>detox</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>And number three: My daughter is having problems learning to read. Her teacher thinks she may be a) disrespectful b) dyslexic c) dysfunctional.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br><span>The answer is b) <strong>dyslexic</strong>. And that’s the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them right.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><br><span>Yes, well done. And now, here’s our top tip for learning vocabulary: when you see or hear a new word, see if you can break the word up - if it starts with a prefix that you recognise, it may help you to understand the meaning.&nbsp; </span></p>

"<h3>Ordinal numbers</h3>
<p>What's the date today? And do you know how to say it? Find out about ordinal numbers and have a go at the quiz in 6 Minute Vocabulary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><br/>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me, Catherine.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And me, Neil. And today we're talking about ordinal numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes. So numbers like <strong>first, second </strong>and <strong>third</strong>. So let's start by listening to Laurence. He's talking about his 18th birthday party. While you listen, try to answer this question: What date was his party? Here's Laurence.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Laurence<br></strong>For my <strong>18th </strong>birthday last year, I invited about sixty friends and relatives! It was on <strong>the twenty-fifth of</strong> May and it was <strong>the first</strong> time that I've ever had a big party. It was in a restaurant on <strong>the third</strong> floor of a hotel. The food was really delicious and I won <strong>second</strong> prize in the dancing competition!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So we asked you: What date was Laurence's birthday party?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answer is: <strong>the twenty-fifth of</strong> May.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>That's right. Now <strong>the twenty-fifth</strong> is an ordinal number like <strong>the</strong> <strong>first</strong> and <strong>the</strong> <strong>second</strong>. Ordinal numbers tell us the position of something in a group - the dates in a month, for example.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Or which birthday it is. Laurence said it was his <strong>eighteenth</strong> birthday.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, he did. Lucky him! And ordinal numbers are different to cardinal numbers. We use cardinal numbers like <strong>one</strong>, <strong>two</strong>, <strong>three</strong> for counting and to answer the question <strong>how many</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And to make a cardinal number into an ordinal number, add the letters <strong>t-h</strong> to the end of the cardinal number. <strong>Eighteen - eighteenth; sixty - sixtieth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>And that works for all the cardinal numbers except for <strong>first, second </strong>and<strong> third</strong> – they're irregular, but for all the others, it's add <strong>t-h, </strong>so that's<strong> fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh…</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>Eighth, ninth, tenth</strong>. So that's good but in writing we do have a couple of irregular spellings, such as <strong>fifth:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>f-i-f-t-h</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>eighth</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>e-i-g-h-t-h</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>ninth</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>n-i-n-t-h</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>twelfth</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>t-w-e-l-f-t-h</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And for numbers ending in<strong> -y </strong>like <strong>sixty</strong>, drop the <strong>-y</strong> and add <strong>-i-e </strong>and<strong> -t-h </strong>to make<strong> sixtieth:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>s-i-x-t-i-e-t-h</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now let's look more closely at dates. Listen for the date in this clip.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br></strong>It was on <strong>the twenty-fifth of</strong> May and it was <strong>the first</strong> time that I've ever had a big party.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>The twenty-fifth of May</strong>. When we say the day before the month, we always use the words <strong>the</strong> and <strong>of</strong>: <strong>the twenty-fifth of May</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>But when we say the month before the day, we don't use the word <strong>of</strong>. It's just <strong>May the twenty-fifth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>We often use the word <strong>the </strong>with ordinal numbers, but we can also use possessives. In this next clip, Laurence uses the possessive adjective <strong>my</strong> before <strong>eighteenth</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br></strong>For my <strong>18th </strong>birthday last year, I invited about sixty friends and relatives!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Let's have another clip.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 3<br></strong>It was in a restaurant on <strong>the third</strong> floor of a hotel. The food was really delicious and I won <strong>second</strong> prize in the dancing competition!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So, now we have two more ways of using ordinal numbers: space and quality.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, we do. And <strong>the third floor</strong> tells us about the position of the floors in space. It's the same as when we give directions, for example: <strong>Take the second left after the traffic lights.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And <strong>second prize</strong> tells us about the quality. And a point to make here is that ordinal numbers can be used as adjectives and adverbs without <strong>the. </strong>Like in the phrase <strong>he won second prize. Second </strong>is an adjective.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And now it's quiz time! Number one: Which of these is correct? The party's on: a) thirtieth of July b) the thirtieth July c) the thirtieth of July.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And it's c) the thirtieth of July.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Great! Now, number two. Which word in this list is wrong? First, second, third, ford, fifth.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br>The answer's <strong>ford</strong>. It should be <strong>fourth</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, it should! Number three: Which of these is correct? a) My twenty-first birthday b) My the twenty-first birthday c) The my twenty-first birthday.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>The answer's a) My twenty-first birthday.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well done if you got them right. But before we go, here's a vocabulary tip. Try saying your own important and memorable dates in English, for example, birthdays, anniversaries and festivals. If the dates are important, you're more likely to remember the English.</p>

<p><strong>Both<br></strong>Bye!</p><br/><h3><strong>Summary&nbsp;- m</strong>eaning and use</h3>
<p>Ordinal numbers tell us the position of something in a group. They are used for:</p>
<p><strong>1. Dates</strong><br><em>It's&nbsp;<strong>the twelfth of November</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>2. The order of events</strong><br><em>Her&nbsp;<strong>fiftieth birthday</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>3. Position in space</strong><br><em>Our apartment's&nbsp;<strong>on the first floor</strong></em><br><em>It's the&nbsp;<strong>third on the right</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>4. Order of quality</strong><br><em>The&nbsp;<strong>first prize</strong>&nbsp;in the competition</em></p>
<h3>Spelling and form</h3>
<p>We usually form ordinal numbers by adding -<strong>th</strong>&nbsp;to cardinal numbers:<br><strong>four - fourth<br></strong><strong>first, second</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>third</strong>&nbsp;are irregular forms<br><strong>fifth, eighth, ninth, twelfth&nbsp;</strong>and numbers ending in<strong>&nbsp;-y&nbsp;</strong>have irregular spellings:&nbsp;<strong>twentieth</strong></p>
<p>We say dates with&nbsp;<strong>the</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>of</strong>:<br><strong><em>the eighth of</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Apr</em><em>il</em><br><em>April&nbsp;<strong>the eighth&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p>But we don't write them like that. We write them as:<br><strong><em>8th April</em></strong><br><strong><em>April 8th</em></strong><br><strong><em>8 April</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>First, second</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>third</strong>&nbsp;have the irregular suffixes&nbsp;<strong>1st, 2nd&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;3rd</strong></p>
<p>We usually use the definite article&nbsp;<strong>the</strong>&nbsp;with ordinal numbers:<strong><br></strong><em>on&nbsp;<strong>the third</strong>&nbsp;day</em><br><em>It was&nbsp;<strong>the first</strong>&nbsp;time I've ever been to France</em></p>
<p>But sometimes we use possessives:<br><em><strong>my thirtieth</strong>&nbsp;birthday</em><br><em><strong>Julia's second</strong>&nbsp;child</em></p>
<p>Ordinal numbers are also used as adjectives and adverbs without&nbsp;<strong>the</strong>&nbsp;or a possessive adjective.</p>"
