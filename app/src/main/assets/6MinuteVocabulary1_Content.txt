"<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me Finn...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And me Catherine. And today's show is all about adjective order.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Adjectives - yes, those useful words we use to describe things. We'll look at what adjective order is - and how to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>There'll be a nice, easy quiz...</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And we'll leave you with a small, but meaningful tip for learning vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So: let's start off with Nikki and Joe who are talking in a furniture shop.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Here's a question to think about while you listen: what did Nikki's grandparents have?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>What did Nikki's grandparents have? Let's find out.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nikki<br/></strong>Joe! Come and sit on this sofa!</p>
<p><strong>Joe<br/></strong>It's really uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>Nikki<br/></strong>I know... but I've always wanted a big, old, leather sofa. My grandparents had one when I was little.</p>
<p><strong>Joe<br/></strong>That's not a good reason to buy a horrible sofa! The one with the stripy blue cotton cushions looks a lot nicer.</p>
<p><strong>Nikki<br/></strong>Maybe... Ooh what's this... Look, a beautiful green and blue Turkish kilim!</p>
<p><strong>Joe<br/></strong>Kilim? Oh, a little carpet. Sofas first, Nikki.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So, that's Joe and Nikki. And we asked you: what did Nikki's grandparents have?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the answer is: they had <em>a big, old, leather sofa</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That's right. And the phrase <em>a big, old, leather sofa</em> is our first example of <strong>adjective order</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now, when we use two or more adjectives together to describe a noun, the order we put them in is important. For example, we don't usually say <em>an old, leather, big sofa.</em></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So for our sofa example, first it's size - so <em>big</em>, then age - <em>old</em>, and then material - <em>leather</em>. A <em>big, old, leather sofa.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So that's size, age, and material type. And each new adjective in the list needs to go in the right place.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>For example, colour goes between age and material type. So we can say: a <em>big, old, red, leather sofa</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now some people find it difficult to remember the adjective order...</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>But there's a good tip which is: the adjective with the meaning most closely related to the noun goes nearest to it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And in our example, the material type - <em>leather</em> - is most closely connected to the noun. <em>Big, old</em> and <em>red</em> are more general. So: <em>big, old, red,&nbsp;<strong>leather</strong> sofa</em>. Another one please, Finn?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong><em>Blue stripy cotton cushions.</em></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So colour - <em>blue</em>, quality - <em>stripy</em>, and material type - <em>cotton</em>. <em>Blue stripy cotton cushions</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And Nikki got very excited about a <em>beautiful green and blue Turkish kilim</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Did she? I can understand that.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yes. So it's a beautiful green and blue Turkish kilim. There we had opinion: beautiful, and then colours: green and blue, we had two colours joined by 'and', and then country: Turkish.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT<br/></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And we're talking about adjective order. And you might have noticed that we used some adjectives at the beginning of the programme.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We had <em>nice, easy quiz</em> - with two opinion adjectives. <em>Easy</em> has a closer connection to the noun <em>quiz</em> than <em>nice</em>. So we put <em>easy</em> next to the noun. A nice easy quiz.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>A nice, easy quiz. And another one: <em>a</em> <em>small, but meaningful tip</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We can put 'but' between adjectives when they seem a bit unusual next to each other. Like <em>small, but meaningful</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong><em>Strange, but true</em>, eh, Catherine?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Indeed. Nothing strange about vocabulary. So let's hear today's examples again. First, size, age, colour, and material.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong><em>Big, old, red, leather sofa</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And <em>leather</em> has the strongest connection to the noun. Next, colour, quality, and material.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong><em>Blue stripy cotton cushions</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And opinion, colour, and country.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong><em>Beautiful green and blue Turkish kilim</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Right. And now it's quiz time. Put these adjectives in the right order. Number 1.&nbsp;<em>I love my ... old, smelly, big dog.</em></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Right: <em>I love my big, old, smelly dog.</em></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Good. Number 2. <em>This is a ... Moroccan, simple, but delicious recipe.</em></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong><em>This is a simple, but delicious, Moroccan recipe.</em></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Very good. And that brings us almost to the end of the programme.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>But before we go, here's that tip we promised you, and it's a game this time. Now, this is a game to play with a friend to practise describing things. Think of a noun but don't tell your friend what it is. Then give adjective clues to help them guess the noun.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Good game. Do you want to play?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Let's give it a go.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Brilliant. There's more about this at bbclearningenglish.com. Join us again for more 6 Minute Vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Both<br/></strong>Goodbye!</p><h3><strong>Vocabulary points to take away</strong></h3><p>Adjective order can be tricky, so it's useful to note down some examples. Writing adjectives before a noun, separated by categories, can be a good way to help you to remember the order. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><strong>Size - age - colour - material:</strong></p>
<p>A big old red leather sofa</p>
<p><strong>Opinion - colour - material:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Some lovely pink and white silk curtains</p>
<p><strong>Size - age - quality:</strong></p>
<p>A big old smelly dog</p>"
"<p><strong><span>Alice</span></strong><span> &nbsp; <br/>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me Alice...</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></span><span>And me, Finn. Today we're looking at compound nouns.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>What are you eating, Finn?? </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>Popcorn. I've also got some ice cream - do you want some Alice? </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Alice&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></strong>Well, maybe after the show.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>Sorry. In today's show, we're looking at compound nouns. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>We'll look at what they are, what they mean and how to use them.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>There'll be a quiz...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>And we'll leave you with a tasty top tip for learning vocabulary. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>So, first up: we're going to listen to Bill and his daughter-in-law talking about Bill's computer. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>And here's a question to think about while you listen: what's wrong with Bill's laptop?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span> &nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>What's wrong with Bill's laptop? Let&rsquo;s find out.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>INSERT<br/></strong></span><strong><span>Bill</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>I'm having problems with this new software.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Susan</span></strong><span> <br/>Where's Mike? He's good with computers.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Bill</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>He's buying postcards at the post office, I think.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Susan</span></strong><span> <br/>Let's have a look then. I think I can fix this.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Bill<br/></strong>Susan, you're my favourite daughter-in-law! But should I buy a new laptop?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Susan<br/></span></strong><span>I think you&rsquo;ll have to Bill. This keyboard doesn&rsquo;t work at all.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>So, that&rsquo;s Bill and his daughter-in-law. And we asked you: what&rsquo;s wrong with Bill&rsquo;s laptop?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>And the answer is: the keyboard doesn't work.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>Now, <strong>keyboard </strong>is a key word in today's show because it's an example of a compound noun.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>That's right. In English vocabulary, we often put two or more nouns together to form a new noun, with a meaning that combines the meanings of the two original nouns. We call these words compound nouns.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice</span></strong><span><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></strong>For example, <strong>keyboard</strong>. The second part - board - names the thing we are talking about.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>The first part tells us what type of thing it is &ndash; it's a board with keys. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>Now, we usually write <strong>keyboard </strong>as one word. Same with <strong>laptop, software </strong>and <strong>postcard</strong>. But we write others as two words. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>For example, <strong>post office</strong> - it's an office where we post things and we write it as two words. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>Unfortunately there aren't really any rules about when to write compound nouns as one word and when to write them as two words - so be sure to use a good dictionary!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>IDENT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>You're listening to bbclearningenglish.com.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice</span></strong><span> &nbsp; <br/>And we're talking about compound nouns. And if you were listening carefully earlier on you might have noticed a few compound nouns right at the start. <strong>Popcorn</strong> was one of them. We also heard <strong>ice cream</strong> - another compound noun! </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>And you may also have noticed how these words are pronounced. With compound nouns, the stress usually goes on the first part, like this - <strong>popcorn, ice cream, keyboard. </strong>What's our final example, Alice?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/><strong>Daughter-in-law.</strong> This compound noun is made of a noun and a prepositional phrase.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span><br/>Now, when we write three-word compounds, we usually use hyphens&nbsp;- little dashes - between the words. This shows the three words go together.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>And the plural is <strong>daughters-in-law</strong>, not <strong>daughter-in-laws</strong>. We are talking about two daughters&nbsp;- so we add the plural 's' to this word.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span> &nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>Do you have any daughters-in-law, Alice?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>No I don't Finn. I'm far too young to have any daughters-in-law. But I do have a sister-in-law, and she's a lovely woman. Let's hear about compound nouns again. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>They're fixed expressions formed from two or three words linked together in different ways. There are compounds we write as one word, like <strong>keyboard, software, </strong>and<strong> popcorn.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>But we write some of them as two separate words, like <strong>post office </strong>and<strong> ice cream</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>Now it's time for a quiz. I'm going to say a compound noun and I'm also going to say whether we write it as one word, two words or with hyphens, and&nbsp;you decide if this is true or false. Ready? Number 1. <strong>Popcorn</strong>. Two words.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>False. It's one word.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>Number 2. <strong>Ice cream.</strong> One word.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice</span></strong><span> &nbsp; <br/>False! It's two words. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span><br/>And number 3. <strong>Daughters-in-law.</strong> With hyphens.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Alice&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></strong>True! </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>That's right, it has hyphens. Well done if you got those right. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>And that brings us almost to the end of the programme.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>But just before we finish, here's today's top tip for learning vocabulary: practise the pronunciation of compound nouns. The stress is on the first word. Try saying 'hot dog' with an equal stress on both words: this means a dog that is hot. Then say it again with the stress on the first word: hot dog is a type of sausage snack.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Alice</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>Great, thank you Finn. That's wonderful. There's more about this at bbclearningenglish.com. Join us again for more 6 Minute Vocabulary. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Both<br/></strong>Goodbye!</span></p>"
"<p><strong>Finn <br/></strong>Hello and welcome to this episode of 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Finn...</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br/></strong>...and I'm Feifei. Hi!</p>
<p><strong>Finn <br/></strong>Today we're going to be talking about contractions, like <strong>I've</strong> meaning I have, or <strong>isn't</strong> meaning is not. We're going to talk about what these contractions mean, and how to pronounce them.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br/></strong>That's right, and learning to use contractions like <strong>I've</strong> or <strong>isn't</strong> when you&rsquo;re speaking will make your English sound much more fluent and natural.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And that's got to be good news. As usual, we'll have lots of examples...</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br/></strong>There'll be a short quiz...</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And finally we'll give you a tip to help you with your vocabulary studies.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br/></strong>So, let's start with an example. Listen to Bill talking about his wife and his brother.</p>
<p><strong>Finn <br/></strong>While you're listening, try to answer this question: has Bill's brother ever visited the US?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/>Bill<br/></strong>My wife and I live in London. <strong>We've</strong> been married for about five years. <strong>I've</strong> always lived in London, but <strong>s</strong><strong>he's</strong> lived in Germany, and the US, and lots of different places. <strong>I've</strong> never been to the US, but my <strong>brother's</strong> been there many times, because his wife is from New York.</p>
<p><strong>Finn <br/></strong>So, Feifei asked you: has Bill's brother ever visited the US?</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br/></strong>And the answer is yes, Bill's brother has been to the US many times, because his wife is American. She's from New York.</p>
<p><strong>Finn <br/></strong>Did you get the answer right? Of course you did!</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br/></strong>Ok, now here is another question. How long have Bill and his wife been married? Listen again and check...</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1<br/></strong>My wife and I live in London. <strong>We've</strong> been married for about five years.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br/></strong>He said 'We've been married for about five years'.</p>
<p><strong>Finn <br/></strong>Did you notice that he didn't say <strong>we have been</strong>, he said <strong>we've been</strong>? When we're speaking, we often shorten the word <strong>have</strong>, and just say <strong>-ve</strong> instead.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br/></strong>So I have becomes <strong>I've</strong>, you have becomes <strong>you've</strong>, we have becomes <strong>we've</strong> and they have becomes <strong>they've</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>We use contractions like <strong>we've</strong> a lot when we're speaking, but sometimes we write them, too - especially when we're writing something informal or unofficial, like an email or a postcard.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br/></strong>Now, when you're writing contractions, remember to use an apostrophe. So, for example, <strong>we've</strong> is spelled <strong>w</strong> - <strong>e</strong> - apostrophe - <strong>v</strong> - <strong>e</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>The apostrophe shows that a letter, or more than one, is missing.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br/></strong>That's right, so when we write <strong>we've</strong> instead of <strong>we have</strong>, we miss the letters h and a from the word 'have'. And the apostrophe shows that these letters have been skipped.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Right, ok. Here's another question about Bill. How many different places has his wife lived in? Can you remember? Here's a clip.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br/></strong><strong>Bill<br/></strong>I've always lived in London, but she's lived in Germany, and the US, and lots of different places.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br/></strong>He said that she's lived in lots of different places. And he mentioned two of them: Germany, and the US.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Did you notice another contraction there? Bill said <strong>s</strong><strong>he's lived</strong>. It's the short form of she has lived. <strong>She's lived</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br/></strong>This is a very common one. Instead of <strong>has</strong>, lots of English speakers say <strong>-'s /z/</strong> instead.</p>
<p><strong>Finn <br/></strong>So instead of <strong>he has</strong> we say <strong>he's</strong>, instead of <strong>she has</strong> it's <strong>she's</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br/></strong>Again, when you use this -<strong>'s</strong> <strong>/z/</strong> contraction instead of has when you're writing, don't forget to use the apostrophe.</p>
<p><strong>Finn <br/></strong>So, <strong>he's</strong> is spelled <strong>h</strong> - <strong>e</strong> - <strong>apostrophe</strong> - <strong>s</strong>, and <strong>she's</strong> is spelled <strong>s</strong> - <strong>h</strong> -<strong> e</strong> - <strong>apostrophe</strong> - <strong>s</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT<br/></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English.com</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br/></strong>And now it's time for a quiz. Number one. When we're speaking, we don't normally say 'I have lived here for three years' - what do we say?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>We say, 'I've lived here for three years'.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br/></strong>Easy question, right?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I think so.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br/></strong>Here's another one: Which pronunciation is correct? Is it a) <strong>He's</strong> <strong>/s/</strong> a teacher or is it b) <strong>He's /z/ </strong>a teacher?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>It's b) He's /z/ a teacher. And one last question. In the sentence <strong>We've been listening to 6 Minute Vocabulary</strong>, how do you spell <strong>we've</strong>?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br/></strong>It's <strong>w - e - apostrophe - v - e.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That's it. Before we go, here's a top tip to help you learn vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br/></strong>Vocabulary learning isn't a silent activity! You'll learn words more effectively if you say them out loud. It doesn't matter if nobody's listening - say the words out loud anyway!</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Absolutely. Very good. There&rsquo;s more about this at <a href=""http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/"">bbclearningenglish.com</a>. Join us again soon for more 6 Minute Vocabulary. Bye!&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br/></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I&rsquo;m Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>And I&rsquo;m Sophie. Hi, Neil, I&rsquo;ve got a question for you.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>What&rsquo;s black and white and read all over?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>What&rsquo;s black and white, and red all over? I don&rsquo;t know that. Go on, tell me&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>A newspaper.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh &ndash; I see&hellip; so it wasn't the colour red, but read [/red/] as in the past form of read [/ri:d/]. White paper, black writing and the &lsquo;read all over&rsquo; bit means people read it. Very good, Sophie. You should go into comedy.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I&rsquo;m not too sure about that, Neil. Sorry for the bad joke everyone, but words that sound the same but have different meanings is actually our topic for today&rsquo;s show.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That&rsquo;s right &ndash; homophones, words that sound the same but have different spellings and different meanings&hellip; Let&rsquo;s listen to Mark and Jane.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Mark&rsquo;s just had an accident in the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And here&rsquo;s a question for you to think about while you listen: what has Mark got on his jeans?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jane<br/></strong>What&rsquo;s wrong, Mark? You look really angry.</p>
<p><strong>Mark<br/></strong>What&rsquo;s wrong, Jane?! Can&rsquo;t you see? I&rsquo;ve got flour all over my jeans.</p>
<p><strong>Jane<br/></strong>You&rsquo;ve got a flower on your jeans? I didn&rsquo;t know you liked pretty things&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Mark<br/></strong>Not a flower, Jane. Flour! Look.</p>
<p><strong>Jane<br/></strong>Ahh, Mark! You&rsquo;re making me a birthday cake. Ahh&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So, that&rsquo;s Mark and Jane.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>And we asked you what Mark had got on his jeans.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And of course, the answer was <strong>flour</strong>. The kind of flour you use to make bread and cakes. And <strong>flour</strong> is spelt <strong>f-l-o-u-r</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Jane thought it was a different kind of <strong>flower</strong>, f-l-o-w-e-r, the brightly coloured and sweet-smelling plant you might have in your garden.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That&rsquo;s right, <strong>flour</strong>, f-l-o-u-r, and <strong>flower</strong>, f-l-o-w-e-r, are homophones &ndash; words that sound the same, but have different spellings and different meanings. Now, homophones can be difficult to learn, and the reason is because they sound exactly the same.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>That&rsquo;s right. And here are some more examples&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Mail</strong>, m-a-i-l, meaning letters and parcels you send in the post, and <strong>male</strong>, m-a-l-e, the opposite of female.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>And here&rsquo;s another one: <strong>right</strong>, r-i-g-h-t, the opposite of left, and <strong>write</strong>, w-r-i-t-e, like write a letter.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Here&rsquo;s one: <strong>peace</strong>, p-e-a-c-e, when it&rsquo;s quiet and calm, and <strong>piece</strong>, p-i-e-c-e, a part of something &ndash; a piece of cake!</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>And one more: <strong>tail</strong>, t-a-i-l, the long, narrow part that sticks out of the back of an animal's body and <strong>tale</strong>, t-a-l-e, a kind of story. What&rsquo;s your favourite fairy tale, Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I really like The Emperor&rsquo;s New Clothes. I think it&rsquo;s really relevant still today. Even for grown-ups.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>It&rsquo;s a great story.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT<br/></strong>You&rsquo;re listening to bbclearningenglish.com.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And we&rsquo;re talking about homophones.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>That&rsquo;s words which are spelt differently and have different meanings, but sound the same.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And now it&rsquo;s time for a quiz. I&rsquo;m going to read a sentence with one of the homophones from today&rsquo;s show. Try to spell the word correctly as you listen and Sophie will tell you the answers afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Good luck!</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Are you ready? Number one. <strong>Ben gave his girlfriend a flower for Valentine&rsquo;s Day</strong>. Now how do you spell <strong>flower</strong> there?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Unless she wanted to bake bread, he gave her a <strong>flower, f-l-o-w-e-r</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Correct. Well done if you got that one right. Number two. <strong>The dog is wagging its tail</strong>. How do you spell <strong>tail</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>This is part of an animal&rsquo;s body, so it&rsquo;s <strong>t-a-i-l</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And well done if you got that one at home. Finally:<strong> The postman put the letters on the table on the right.</strong> How do you spell <strong>right</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>The table&rsquo;s on the <strong>right</strong>, not on the left, so it&rsquo;s <strong>r-i-g-h-t</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well done to everyone at home who got those right.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>And that almost brings us to the end of the programme. But before we go, here&rsquo;s today&rsquo;s top tip for learning vocabulary. Homophones are difficult to spell correctly when you hear them because they sound the same. So, if you think a word might be a homophone, read or listen to the words around it very carefully. That will help you get a better idea what word it is and how to spell it.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>There&rsquo;s more about homophones at bbclearningenglish.com. Join us again for more 6 Minute Vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Both<br/></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Hi! Welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. My name is Catherine, and I'm here with Rob.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hello everyone. Today we're going to be talking about different words for jobs, and especially how those words change depending on whether a man or a woman is doing the job.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, and listen carefully because we're going to give you a quick quiz.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And then you'll get a tip to help with your vocabulary learning.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Right, so let's get started! First we're going to listen to listen to Joe, talking about how he met his girlfriend, Judith.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>While you listen, here's a question for you to think about: what is Judith's job now? Listen carefully!</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Joe<br/></strong>Well, I used to be an <strong>actor</strong>, and I met Judith at work. We were doing a play about a <strong>policeman</strong>, who falls in love with a <strong>waitress</strong>. I played the <strong>policeman</strong>, and Judith played the <strong>waitress</strong> &ndash; and sure enough, we fell in love! Later, I quit acting, and now I'm a <strong>businessman</strong>. But Judith has a successful acting career &ndash; right now, she's on a film shoot: she's playing a <strong>firefighter</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So, the question was: what is Judith's job now?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And the answer is, Judith is an <strong>actress</strong>. Right now, she's making a film.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>The first job that Joe mentioned was <strong>actor</strong>. Now, this is one of those jobs where the word changes, depending on whether a man or a woman is doing the job. So, we say that a man is an <strong>actor</strong>, but a woman is an <strong>actress</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>That's right. When Joe met Judith, she was playing a <strong>waitress</strong>. Again, we can say a man is a <strong>waiter</strong>, and a woman is a <strong>waitress</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yeah, so we've got<strong> actor, actress; waiter, waitress. </strong>You can hear the pattern, can't you?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I can, yes. Judith was playing a <strong>waitress</strong> in the play, but can you remember what Joe was playing? Listen again:</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1<br/></strong>We were doing a play about a <strong>policeman</strong>, who falls in love with a <strong>waitress</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Right, so Joe was playing a policeman, and we say that a man is a <strong>policeman</strong>, and a woman is a <strong>policewoman</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Now, Joe is a businessman because he's a man. But for a woman, we can say <strong>businesswoman</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yeah, so<strong> policeman, policewoman; businessman, businesswoman.</strong> Easy, isn't it?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well maybe it's not quite so easy, because we know that Judith is making a film right now, but do you remember what sort of character she is playing? Listen again and check:</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br/></strong>But Judith has a successful acting career &ndash; right now, she's on a film shoot: she's playing a <strong>firefighter</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK, so Judith is playing a <strong>firefighter</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>But wait, hold on a minute Catherine, there's something strange about that word, <strong>firefighter</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, Indeed. A <strong>waiter</strong> is a man, and a <strong>policewoman</strong> is a woman. What about a <strong>firefighter</strong>? Man or woman? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, in fact, the word <strong>firefighter </strong>is the same for a man or a woman. More and more, in modern English, people prefer to use words for jobs which are the same for both sexes.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>They do. For example, some people prefer not to use the word<strong> actress</strong>. They just like to use the word <strong>actor</strong> for a man or a woman.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And instead of <strong>policeman</strong> or <strong>policewoman</strong>, we can say <strong>police officer</strong>. That's good for a man or a woman, too.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And that's why we say <strong>firefighter</strong>. We don't say fireman, firewoman, we just use<strong> firefighter</strong> these days for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT<br/></strong>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And we're talking about job words that change depending on whether a man or a woman is doing the job&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>&hellip;and job words that are the same for both men and women.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Those are my preferred options, what about you Rob?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I think it's easier and less complicated, yes, to use those sort of generic words.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yeah, like <strong>presenter</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Like <strong>presenter</strong>. Not 'presenteress' or anything like that.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Indeed. And some job titles that used to be different for men and women are now being replaced by a single job title for both sexes. For example on planes, in the past, we used to have <strong>stewards</strong> and <strong>stewardesses</strong> looking after the passengers. Now we just have, Rob&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/> Flight attendants</strong>. And instead of a <strong>chairman</strong> or a <strong>chairwoman</strong> in charge of a formal meeting, these days we often hear the word <strong>chairperson.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Or just <strong>chair</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Right, so now it's time to see how much you can remember. And we've got three quiz questions for you. Number one: if the word for a man is<strong> businessman</strong>,what's the word for a woman?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And the answer is <strong>businesswoman</strong>. Second, if the word for a woman is <strong>waitress</strong>, what's the word for a man?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Waiter</strong>! Right, and just one more question: if a man can be a <strong>policeman</strong>, and a woman can be a <strong>policewoman,</strong> what's the word that's equally good for a man or a woman?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>It's <strong>police officer</strong>! Did you get all those right? Well done if you did!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And before we go, here's a top tip to help you learn your vocabulary more effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>When you're out and about, walking down the street, or sitting on the bus, notice the people you see, and say the words for them to yourself in English - like<strong> waitress</strong> or <strong>police officer</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Or <strong>presenter</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Indeed.</p>

"<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>Hello! Welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I&rsquo;m Rob.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>And I&rsquo;m Catherine. And today we&rsquo;re talking about new words.</p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>Yes, new words in English. We&rsquo;ll look at where they come from, why we need them and who uses them.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>We&rsquo;ll have a quiz; and we&rsquo;ll also bring you a top tip for learning vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>But first, here&rsquo;s Iris, talking about a photograph she took.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>And here&rsquo;s a question: is Iris happy with her photo?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span>Iris<br/></span></strong>So here&rsquo;s a <strong>selfie</strong> from a <strong>flashmob</strong> I went to &ndash; there&rsquo;s everyone dancing and stuff, and that&rsquo;s my idiot boyfriend at the back: he decided to <strong>photobomb</strong> me! It&rsquo;s quite funny though&hellip; I put it on my social networks &ndash; but the <strong>t</strong><strong>rolls</strong> said we looked stupid! I don&rsquo;t care though, I like it.</p>
<p><strong>STING</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>So that&rsquo;s Iris. And she said she liked the photo.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Good. Now there were a few words there which are quite new in English. Let&rsquo;s have a look at some of them. Listen again to Iris. Two questions this time. One: what type of photo did she take and two: where was she?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/> </strong>So this is a <strong>selfie</strong> from a <strong>flashmob I went to</strong>&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>Iris took a <strong>selfie</strong>, and she was at a <strong>flashmob</strong>. Let&rsquo;s take those words one at a time.</p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>Yes, first of all, a very popular word now, <strong>selfie</strong>. That&rsquo;s a photograph you take of yourself, by holding your camera or phone out in front of you at arm&rsquo;s length.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Yeah, <strong>selfie</strong>. Take many <strong>selfies</strong> Rob?</p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>Absolutely not, no.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>None at all?</p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>Don&rsquo;t want to look at myself, thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>But where does the word <strong>selfie</strong> come from? Well the word <strong>self</strong>-<strong>portrait </strong>has been around for a long time. It means &lsquo;a picture you draw or paint of yourself&rsquo;. So <strong>selfie</strong> probably comes from that.</p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>And that&rsquo;s one way words come into English. Get an old word, change it to fit a new situation and you&rsquo;ve got a new word like <strong>selfie</strong>. And that&rsquo;s one reason why we need new words &ndash; to talk about new situations, like all these self-portraits that everyone&rsquo;s taking.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Yeah, good. Now another way to make a new word for a new situation is to get two old words and put them together. Iris was at a <strong>flashmob</strong>. Now, a <strong>flashmob</strong> is a crowd of people who gather together quickly and suddenly &ndash; it&rsquo;s often organised through social media. Now the word <strong>flash</strong> can mean &lsquo;something that happens very quickly&rsquo;, and a <strong>mob</strong> is a crowd of people. So when you put them together, you&rsquo;ve got the perfect new word for the situation. Ever been on a <strong>flashmob</strong> Rob?</p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>I&rsquo;m afraid not, no one&rsquo;s invited me actually.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Really? I&rsquo;ll invite you on the next one I go on.</p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>Thank you. Anyway, you&rsquo;ve probably noticed that these words are mostly made by people on social media. It&rsquo;s not the only place that new words come from, but a lot of new words are coming from social media at the moment.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Next example. Iris&rsquo;s boyfriend jumped into her <strong>selfie</strong> at the last minute. He&rsquo;s actually in the photo even though she wasn't expecting him to be! And here&rsquo;s the word for it:</p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br/></span></strong>&hellip;and that&rsquo;s my idiot boyfriend at the back: he decided to <strong>photobomb</strong> me!</p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>So: <strong>photobomb.</strong> That&rsquo;s a new word made from two old words: <strong>photo</strong>, obviously, and <strong>bomb</strong>, the thing that suddenly explodes. And we&rsquo;ve got similar new words like <strong>weatherbomb</strong>&hellip;</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>That&rsquo;s a sudden period of extreme weather, and then there&rsquo;s <strong>thoughtbomb </strong>where people get together and, basically &ndash; think!</p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>Yes, that&rsquo;s a new word for what we used to call &lsquo;brainstorm&rsquo;...?</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>It is, yes. Very similar.</p>
<p>Good, right, OK. Well now, Iris used another new word to describe people who post horrible comments on social media. Listen carefully to this:</p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT 1 CLIP 3<br/></span></strong>I put it on my social networks &ndash; but the <strong>t</strong><strong>rolls</strong> said we looked stupid!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>A person who posts negative comments on social media is called a <strong>troll</strong>. And <strong>troll</strong> is actually an old word for an imaginary creature &ndash; a kind of monster. You find lots of trolls in old Scandinavian stories &ndash; and the word&rsquo;s been around in English for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>So an old word, with a new meaning &ndash; but there&rsquo;s a link there to the original meaning isn&rsquo;t there Rob?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Yes that&rsquo;s right, because both kinds of troll are quite ugly in their own way &ndash; either in their looks or behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT<br/></strong>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>And we&rsquo;re talking about new words. So Catherine, have you ever been trolled?</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Thankfully I haven&rsquo;t Rob, I choose my friends very carefully on social media.</p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>Good, good.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Right, it&rsquo;s quiz time! Question one: what&rsquo;s the word for a group of people who gather together suddenly, and it&rsquo;s normally organised on social media?</p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>Any ideas? The word is <strong>flashmob</strong>. Question two: what word means: &lsquo;jump into someone else&rsquo;s photograph&rsquo;?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That&rsquo;s <strong>photobomb</strong>. Finally, what&rsquo;s the word for people who write nasty, negative comments online?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>They are<strong> trolls</strong>. OK, well done if you got those right at home.</p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Catherine<br/></span></strong>Well done indeed. And now here&rsquo;s a vocabulary tip. To keep your English right up-to-date, join some social media groups where people use English. Social media is a great place to pick up words and expressions that are in use, even though they&rsquo;re not in the dictionary.</p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>Yes, and new words are being invented all the time aren&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>They are, yes.</p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>OK, well there&rsquo;s more about this at <a href=""http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/"">bbclearningenglish.com</a>. You can also find us on Twitter, Facebook and many other social networks but, don&rsquo;t <strong>troll</strong> us please.</p>

<p><span><strong>Both</strong><br/></span>Bye</p>"
"<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me Rob...</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>And me Sophie. And today's show is all about similar words.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, similar words - words that are close in meaning, but which we use in different ways. We'll look at what they are, what they mean and how to use them.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>We're hoping for high scores in our quiz...</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And we'll leave you with a big tip for learning vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>So, first let's listen to two architects travelling up the Burj Khalifa building in Dubai.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Here's a question to think about while you listen: what's special about this building?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>What's special about this building? Let's find out.</p>
<p><strong>Insert 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Marisa<br/></strong>We've reached the top. How high are we?</p>
<p><strong>Jon<br/></strong>We're on the 124th floor.</p>
<p><strong>Marisa<br/></strong>Wow - so this is the tallest building in the world. It's pretty impressive.</p>
<p><strong>Jon<br/></strong>You can really see how big the city is. And also what a large number of construction projects are happening here.</p>
<p><strong>Marisa<br/></strong>So why did we come here today?</p>
<p><strong>Jon<br/></strong>Well, I've got some big ideas about our next building project that I want to discuss!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So, Jon and Marisa are architects. And we asked you: what's special about the Burj Khalifa?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>And the answer is: it's the tallest building in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And 'tall' is one of today's <strong>similar words</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>That's right, and 'high' is another. These words have a similar meaning - they describe something that is more than average height.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So what's the difference, Sophie?</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>We usually use 'high' for things that are wider than their vertical height, for example, high mountains or a high wall. And we use 'tall' for things that are narrower than their vertical height, like people or trees.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Or buildings - as we heard just now. Buildings with many floors often have greater height than width, like the Burj Khalifa.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>That's right. But we can also talk about 'high buildings': <em>Sherlock Holmes fell from the top of a high building.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Context is always important for choosing the right word. We use 'high' in this sentence because it's the position of the top of the building that's important - not the building as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Great explanation, Sherlock. Another example?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK. 'Big' and 'large'. These words both mean something that is more than average size. In general, we use 'big' more often than 'large' - and we use it to talk about real things, like 'big cities', and abstract things, like 'big ideas'.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>What's your big idea for today, Rob?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, my big idea of the day is world peace. You hear about so much death and destruction in the news I really think that world peace is what we should be aiming for.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Well, that is a big idea - big because unfortunately it's quite an abstract idea, which is why we say big idea and not large idea. So, when do we use large?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK, well, we use 'large' when we want to sound more formal, for example, <em>Dubai has the largest population in the United Arab Emirates.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>We also use 'large' in some fixed expressions. Jon talks about Dubai having 'a large number of construction projects' in progress.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT<br/></strong>6 Minute Vocabulary from bbclearningenglish.com.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And we're talking about similar words. Now let's hear today's words again.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong><em>Big </em>and<em> large</em>. Meaning more than average size.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong><em>'</em>Big' for real and abstract things: <em>big city</em>, <em>big house</em>, <em>big decision</em>, <em>big ideas</em>. 'Large' for real things with a more formal tone: <em>a</em> <em>large population, a large number of projects</em>, <em>a large amount of money</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong><em>High </em>and<em> tall.</em> Meaning more than average height.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>'High' for things that are wider than their vertical height: <em>high mountains</em>, <em>high wall, high windows, high bookshelf</em>. 'Tall' for things that are narrower than their vertical height: <em>tall buildings</em>, <em>tall people, tall trees, tall grass, tall Sophie!</em></p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Thanks Rob! And remember that context is very important!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Thank you Sophie. And now it's quiz time. Is the English in these sentences right or wrong? Number 1:&nbsp;<em>My brother is 180cm high.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>And the answer is: Wrong. <em>He's 180cm tall.</em><strong><br/></strong>Number 2. <em>I looked down from the high window to the garden below.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>And the answer is: Right<em>. </em>And finally, number 3. <em>Moving house is a large decision to make.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And the answer is: Wrong. It's <em>a big decision!</em></p>
<p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>And that brings us almost to the end of the programme.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>But before we go, here's our big tip for remembering vocabulary: use internet search engines to check how often words are used together. It'll help you choose the right words!</p>

"<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I&rsquo;m Finn...</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And I&rsquo;m Alice. Today we&rsquo;re looking at a very important part of word building &ndash; suffixes.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Suffixes. We&rsquo;ll look at what they are, what they mean and how to use them.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>There&rsquo;ll be a quiz&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And we&rsquo;ll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So: to start off, we&rsquo;re going to listen to Andrea and Steve who work in a bank. They have just interviewed two people who want to work there.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And here&rsquo;s a question to think about while you listen: who did Andrea and Steve like best - the first person or the second person?</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Who did they like best? Let&rsquo;s find out.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>INSERT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrea<br/></strong>What do you think then Steve?</p>
<p><strong>Steve<br/></strong>Well, the first one was very excitable: he kept laughing and speaking fast.</p>
<p><strong>Andrea<br/></strong>Perhaps it was just nervousness, but there&rsquo;s no room for that in this business.</p>
<p><strong>Steve<br/></strong>No. Now I thought the second interviewee seemed a bit more responsible.</p>
<p><strong>Andrea<br/></strong>Yes, she did &ndash; very important when dealing with money. And she was polite.</p>
<p><strong>Steve<br/></strong>Politeness is essential in this job.</p>
<p><strong>Andrea<br/></strong>Absolutely. Well, I think we both know which one is more employable.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So, that&rsquo;s Steve and Andrea. And we asked you: who did they like best?</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And the answer is: they definitely liked the second person best. The second one was polite and responsible. The first one was a bit too excitable.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That&rsquo;s right, and <em>excitable</em> is a key word in the show today because it ends in a suffix.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Now in the world of vocabulary, a suffix is a group of letters that you can add to the end of a word to change its form, or meaning, or both. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>For example, the word <em>excitable</em> has the suffix -<em>able</em>, spelt <em>a-b-l-e. </em>-<em>able </em>makes verbs into adjectives, and we use &ndash;<em>able</em> words to say that a subject can do something &ndash; is able to do something - or they behave in a particular way.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So if we take the verb <em>excite</em>, add the suffix -<em>able</em>, we can say that the first interviewee was <em>excitable</em>, meaning: he can get very excited.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And the second one was <em>responsible</em>, that&rsquo;s <em>responsible</em> with<em> &ndash;ible, </em>spelt<em> &lsquo;i-b-l-e&rsquo;. </em>She can be trusted to do the right thing. And that&rsquo;s why she was more <em>employable</em>, now that's -<em>able</em> with an <em>a</em> again.</p>
<p>Now for another suffix. Andrea and Steve talked about two <em>interviewees. </em>The suffix <em>&ndash;ee</em>, spelt <em>e-e</em>, makes a noun which means &lsquo;the person who receives an action&rsquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>For example, if you add <em>&ndash;ee</em> to<em> interview, </em>you get the person who receives an interview, an <em>interviewee</em>.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT<br/></strong>You&rsquo;re listening to BBC Learning English dot com.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And we&rsquo;re talking about suffixes. Our final suffix for today is <em>&ndash;ness</em>, spelt <em>n-e-s-s.</em> Adding <em>&ndash;ness</em> to an adjective makes a noun.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That&rsquo;s right, and interviewee number one suffered from <em>nervousness</em> &ndash; the noun form of <em>nervous</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>But number two understood the importance of <em>politeness</em> &ndash; the noun form of <em>polite</em>. Is politeness important to you Alice?</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Oh yes Finn, politeness is very important to me.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I think you&rsquo;re very polite. Now let&rsquo;s listen to today&rsquo;s suffixes and words again.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>The first one was: -<em>able </em>with an<em> a. a-b-l-e.</em></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong><em>excitable, employable</em></p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>-<em>ible </em>withan<em> i. i-b-l-e.</em></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong><em>responsible</em></p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>-<em>ee: e-e</em></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong><em>interviewee</em></p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>-<em>ness: n-e-s-s</em></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong><em>nervousness, politeness</em></p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And it&rsquo;s time for a quiz. Choose the correct suffix to complete the final words in these 2 sentences. Ready?</p>
<p>Number 1.The most important thing to me is my family&rsquo;s&hellip; a) happy-ee b) happy-able, c) happiness.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>This one is the noun form of happy, so it&rsquo;s c) <em>happiness.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Number 2. I&rsquo;m learning how to do this job. I&rsquo;m a a) trainee b) trainable, c) train-ness.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>You are receiving training, so you&rsquo;re a <em>trainee.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well done if you got those right.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And that brings us almost to the end of today&rsquo;s programme.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>But before we go, here&rsquo;s today&rsquo;s top tip for learning vocabulary: if you use an online dictionary, type a hyphen or a dash into the search box, and then type in any of today&rsquo;s suffixes. The dictionary will give you a list of words that end with your suffix.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>You know, that&rsquo;s a really good tip: I think I might try that. There&rsquo;s more about this at BBC learning English dot com. Join us again for more 6 Minute Vocabulary.</p>

"<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Rob...</p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Catherine<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">And I'm Catherine. And our topic today is weather. Now Rob, apparently, British people love to talk about the weather. Do you think that's true?<br/></span><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br/>Rob<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Absolutely, you know me, I'm talking about it all the time. And in today's programme, we'll look at some key weather vocabulary and show you how to use it in different types of sentences.<br/></span><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br/>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">There'll be a quiz...<br/></span><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br/>Rob<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">And we'll give you a top tip to help you learn vocabulary more effectively.&nbsp;<br/></span><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br/>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">So, on with the show! We'll start by listening to Harvey, talking about the weather where he lives. And we have a question for you at home.<br/></span><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br/>Rob<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">The question is: what is the weather like for Harvey in spring?<br/></span><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br/>INSERT<br/>Harvey<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">I live in the north. I love it here, but the weather isn't too good. There's a lot of <strong>rain</strong> in the autumn and winter. In fact, <strong>it's raining</strong> right now. Sometimes it <strong>snows</strong> in the winter. In the spring the weather's usually quite <strong>windy</strong>. But it's lovely and <strong>sunny</strong> in summer.&nbsp;<br/></span><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br/>Rob</span></strong><strong><br/></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">So, that's Harvey. And we asked you about the weather in spring. What's it like?<br/></span><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br/>Catherine</span></strong><strong><br/></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Harvey said that the weather gets quite <strong>windy</strong> in spring.<br/></span><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br/>Rob</span></strong><strong><br/></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Well done if you got that right. And we'll talk more about windy weather later. First, let's talk about the rain! Listen to this clip:<br/></span><span data-mce-mark=""1""><strong><br/>INSERT&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></strong>There's a lot of <strong>rain</strong> in the autumn and winter.<br/></span><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br/>Catherine</span></strong><strong><br/></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">In this sentence, <strong>rain</strong> is a noun, so in a sentence, we can say <strong>there is a lot of rain,</strong> or we can add a main verb, for example: <strong>I like rain</strong>. Rob - how do you feel about rain?<br/></span><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br/>Rob<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">I hate rain because I like to do a lot of cycling and when it rains I get wet. But the word <strong>rain</strong> can also be a verb. For example: <strong>it rains a lot</strong> here in London; in fact, look out the window: <strong>it's raining now</strong>!<br/></span><span data-mce-mark=""1""><strong><br/>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span data-mce-mark=""1"">It's always raining in London! And can add a letter 'y' to the end of rain to make the adjective <strong>rainy</strong>. Rob, do you use an umbrella on <strong>rainy</strong> days?<br/><br/></span><strong>R</strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><strong>ob<br/></strong></span><span data-mce-mark=""1"">No I don't, I wear a coat - more practical.&nbsp;<br/></span><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br/>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">More 'blokey'!<br/></span></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>More 'blokey', yes. &nbsp;So that's the noun - rain; the verb - rain; and the adjective - rainy. The word <strong>snow</strong> works in the same way. Listen to this another clip.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><span>Sometimes it <strong>snows</strong> in the winter.<br/></span><span><strong><br/>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span><strong>Sometimes it snows in winter.</strong> The word <strong>snow</strong> there is a verb.<br/></span><strong><span><br/>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>As a noun, we can say: <strong>sometimes there is snow.<br/></strong></span><strong><span><br/>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Or we can add the letter <strong>'y'</strong> to make an adjective. <strong>S</strong><strong>ometimes it's snowy</strong>.<br/></span><span><strong><br/>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>Good.

In this sentence, <strong>windy</strong> is an adjective.<br/></span><strong><span><br/>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>We can also use the word <strong>wind</strong> as a noun. <strong>Is there much wind today</strong> Catherine?&nbsp;<br/></span><span><strong><br/>Catherine</strong> <br/></span><span>There's quite a lot actually, I got quite blown around. So that's <strong>wind</strong> as a noun and <strong>windy</strong> as an adjective, but we can't use <strong>wind</strong> as a verb. You have to use a different verb like <strong>blow</strong>. The wind is blowing very hard today...<br/></span><span><strong><br/>Rob</strong> <br/></span><span>Right. And the word <strong>sun</strong> is the same. It's a noun:<br/></span><span><strong><br/>Catherine</strong> <br/></span><span><strong>The sun is hot</strong>...<br/></span><span><strong><br/>Rob</strong> <br/></span><span>It can make an adjective:<br/></span><span><strong><br/>Catherine</strong> <br/></span><strong><span>It's lovely and sunny</span></strong>...<strong><span><br/></span></strong><span><strong><br/>Rob</strong> <br/></span><span>But it isn't a verb.

"<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary - the show that teaches you how to study vocabulary. I'm Finn...</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/> </strong>And I'm Alice. Hello. Today's show is all about fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Ahh, fashion. What to wear...</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/> </strong>And what not to wear. And today we're going to listen to some people talking about what to wear to a social occasion...</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>And we'll look at a very important area of vocabulary: the difference between adjectives and adverbs.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/> </strong>We'll have a quiz to test what we've learnt...</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>And we'll give you a top tip to help you learn more vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/> </strong>So let's get started - with a conversation. Mike and Sarah are getting ready to go to a party, but they have very different ideas about what Mike should wear.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>While you listen, try to answer this question. What does Mike wear to the party?</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/> </strong>Let's find out.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong><em>Sarah<br/></em></strong><em>You're not seriously going to the party dressed like that! You'll be the most scruffily-dressed man there.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Mike<br/> </em></strong><em>The invitation said casual, so I'm dressing casually: jeans and a T-shirt. What's wrong with that?</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Sarah<br/> </em></strong><em>It's too scruffy: the invitation said smart-casual. You need to wear something much smarter, Mike.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Mike<br/> </em></strong><em>What, a suit?</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Sarah<br/> </em></strong><em>No, that's too formal - it's not a job interview. Just wear a nice fashionable shirt.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Mike<br/> </em></strong><em>But I hate fashion. I can't dress fashionably. I'm the most unfashionable person I know.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Sarah<br/> </em></strong><em>Well, you'll be the only one in a T-shirt.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Mike<br/> </em></strong><em>OK, you win. I'll wear my black shirt and the smart shoes. But I'm still wearing my jeans.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Sarah<br/> </em></strong><em>If you must.</em></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>So, did you hear what Mike wore to the party in the end?</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/> </strong>He wore a black shirt, jeans, and his smart shoes.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>Well done if you got that right. Now, let's take a closer look at some of the fashion-related vocabulary we heard there - starting with some of the adjectives.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/> </strong>Yes and of course adjectives are words which describe nouns, and there were lots of adjectives describing people and their clothes. Sarah thinks Mike is scruffy.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>Which means not neat or clean.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/> </strong>But Mike wants to be casual.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>Informal and comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/> </strong>She thinks he should be smart.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>Nice and stylish.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/> </strong>But not too formal.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>Old-fashioned and serious.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/> </strong>And she wants him to wear something fashionable.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>New and stylish.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/> </strong>Now, we can change these words into adverbs - words that describe verbs. And Mike and Sarah used lots of adverbs to describe the way people dress. We heard: <em>scruffily</em>, <em>casually</em>, <em>smartly</em>, <em>formally</em> and <em>fashionably</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>And because they are adverbs, they all end in the letters 'l-y'. Here are some clips from the conversation. Listen out for adverbs which describe the verb dress.</p>
<p><em>You'll be the most scruffily-dressed man there.</em></p>
<p><em>So I'm dressing casually. Jeans and a T-shirt.</em></p>
<p><em>I can't dress fashionably.</em></p>
<p><strong>IDENT<br/></strong>You're listening to bbclearningenglish.com.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/> </strong>And coming up soon is our vocabulary quiz: but first, let's have a quick recap of today's fashion-related vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>First we had some adjectives.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/> </strong>Scruffy, casual, smart, formal, fashionable.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>And then we looked at some adverbs.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/> </strong>Scruffily, casually, smartly, formally, fashionably.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>And now: it's quiz time. All you have to do is finish the sentences with words from today's programme. There are two sentences, each with three choices. So, are we ready? Number 1: <em>Everyone is wearing tight jeans this year - they are really</em>: a) fashion b) fashionable c) fashionably.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/> </strong>The answer is: b) fashionable.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>That's right. Now, question 2. <em>I had a job interview yesterday, so I dressed very</em>: a) formally b) scruffy c) formal.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/> </strong>It's: a) formally.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>That's right.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/> </strong>I hope you got that at home. And that brings us to the end of today's show, so we'll leave you with today's top tip for learning vocabulary, which is, Finn...</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>To help you remember how to use adjectives and adverbs, it's a really good idea to write down example sentences.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/> </strong>That's right. Example sentences will help you use words more accurately than if you just note down the word with a translation.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>And there's more about this on bbclearningenglish.com. Join us again for more 6 Minute Vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Both<br/> </strong>Bye!</p><br><h3>Adjectives</h3><p>Adjectives are words that describe nouns.</p>
<p><strong>scruffy<br/></strong>not neat or clean</p>
<p>Example: <em>He's wearing a scruffy old t-shirt.</em></p>

<p>Example: <em>You must wear a formal suit for the interview.</em></p>
<p><strong>fashionable<br/></strong>new and popular</p>
<p>Example: <em>Stripy trousers were fashionable a few years ago.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Adverbs</h3><p>Adverbs are words that describe verbs.</p>

<p><strong>formally</strong></p>
<p><em>Everyone will dress formally at the wedding.</em></p>
<p><strong>fashionably</strong></p>
<p><em>Sarah was fashionably dressed in a blue coat.&nbsp;</em></p>"
"<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary - if you're serious about vocabulary, we'll show you how to learn it. I'm Finn...</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And I'm Alice. In today's show we're going to look at a very interesting area of vocabulary - prefixes.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>We'll look at what they are, what they mean and how to use them.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>There'll be a quiz...</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And we'll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>But before all that, we're going to hear from Dave. He's just got back from lunch, but he isn't happy.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Now, a question to think about while you listen: what was the problem with Dave's food?</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>What was the problem with Dave's food? Let's find out.</p>
<p><strong>Example<br/></strong><em>I just tried the new seafood restaurant, and I wish I hadn't. It was&nbsp;<strong>intolerable</strong>! To start with, my seat was really&nbsp;<strong>uncomfortable</strong>. I had no room to move. And the menu was very&nbsp;<strong>misleading</strong>. The photos looked nothing like the actual food. When my food came it was&nbsp;<strong>uncooked</strong>. I told the waiter, but he&nbsp;<strong>disagreed</strong>. He said it was fine. He said he'd eat it himself! And I looked in the kitchen &ndash; it was really&nbsp;<strong>unhygienic</strong>. There was food all over the floor. It was a&nbsp;<strong>disgrace</strong>!</em></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So Dave's pretty unhappy. And what was wrong with his food?</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, he said that it was uncooked. It was cold and raw because it hadn't been cooked.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Not very nice! Well done if you got that right at home. Now, <em>uncooked</em> is an example of the vocabulary area we're looking at today - prefixes.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes: prefixes - or as some people say: prefixes. Prefixes, prefixes. A prefix is a small part of a word, usually just a couple of letters, that we put at the front of a base word to change its meaning. For example, the prefix un, spelt u-n, is added to happy, to make unhappy, which means not happy.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And Dave was unhappy about the restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. He said the seats were uncomfortable - meaning not comfortable, and the kitchen was unhygienic, meaning unclean - not clean.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So that's un, meaning 'not' - and all today's prefixes have the meaning of not. So, Dave said the meal was intolerable. Intolerable. In - spelt i-n - is another prefix that can mean not &ndash; and poor Dave couldn't tolerate the meal. Now, let's listen to a bit more of Dave.</p>
<p><strong>Example<br/></strong><em>...I told the waiter, but he&nbsp;<strong>disagreed</strong>. He said it was fine.</em></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>The waiter disagreed with him about the food. The prefix dis, spelt d-i-s, means not, or 'to do the opposite', like disagree - to not agree.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, and Dave said it was a disgrace - they should be ashamed of it.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Let's hear today's prefixes again.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>The first one was: un.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Unhappy, uncooked, unhygienic, unclean.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>In.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Intolerable, inexpensive.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Dis.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Disagree, disgrace.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT<br/></strong>You're listening to bbclearningenglish.com</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And it's time for a quiz. Try to work out the word that finishes the sentence. Ready? Number 1. <em>The advert said that the phone was &pound;5 a month, but it didn't say anything about the &pound;50 set-up fee. It was very...</em> a) unhappy b) inexpensive c) misleading.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>The advert made people believe something that isn't true, so it was very... c) misleading.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Now number 2. <em>This letter has come to the wrong house. There's been a...</em> a) mistake b) disgrace c) disagreement.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>It's not correct so... a) mistake.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well done if you got those right.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And that brings us almost to the end of today's programme.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Before we go, here's today's top tip for learning vocabulary: if you look up some of today's words in a dictionary, you'll find lots more words starting with the same prefixes. Many of them may be words that you already knew without the prefix. So, when you add a prefix, you get two words for the price of one!</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That's brilliant. Sounds like a good way to quickly double your vocabulary. There's more about this at bbclearningenglish.com. Join us again for more 6 Minute Vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Both<br/></strong>Bye!</p><br><h3>Vocabulary</h3><p>Here are the prefixes and examples used in the programme:</p>
<p><strong>un-</strong></p>
<p><strong>unhappy<br/></strong>not happy</p>
<p><em>The football fans were very unhappy when their team lost.</em></p>

<p><em>You can't eat these uncooked apples. They are very sour.</em></p>
<p><strong>unclean<br/></strong>not clean</p>
<p><em>That water is unclean. You shouldn't drink it.</em></p>
<p><strong>in-</strong></p>
<p><strong>intolerable<br/></strong>cannot be tolerated or accepted</p>

"<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Finn...</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And I'm Alice. In today's show we're going to look chunks of language.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yes, and by chunks of language we mean groups of words that naturally go together. And we're going to do that by listening to Kirsten, a student from Germany, talking about her typical morning.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>We'll look closely at the chunks of language Kirsten uses...</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>We'll have a quiz to see what we've learnt...</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And we'll bring you a top tip for learning vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>But before all that, we&rsquo;re going to hear from Kirsten, who's studying right here in London.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>She's talking about her typical college day. Now, two questions for you to think about while you listen. First, why does Kirsten have to leave?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And second, why do you think Kirsten&rsquo;s English sounds a little bit unnatural?</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Let&rsquo;s find out.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT</strong><strong><br/></strong>My typical morning? Well, I never go out on an <em>unfilled stomach</em>, so before class, I usually have a <em>complete English breakfast </em>&ndash; I love it.Getting to class can <em>take a big time</em> because it is<em> the rush period. </em>But when I get to class it is a <em>lot of enjoyment</em> because my classmates come from<em> all over the earth. </em>Anyway, I must go into class right now, but I&rsquo;ll be <em>back in a period</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So, why does she have to leave?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>She has to go to class. Well done if you got that. But why did Kirsten&rsquo;s English sound a little bit unnatural?</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, we understood her, but she did make some unusual word choices.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yes. And that&rsquo;s because she made some mistakes when she tried to use English fixed expressions, or chunks of language.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong><em>Chunks</em> are groups of words that naturally go together &ndash; they are fixed expressions and they can&rsquo;t usually be changed. So instead of learning them word by word, we can think of them as one complete piece of language. Let&rsquo;s look at some of Kirsten&rsquo;s chunks.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>First she said she doesn&rsquo;t like going out <em>on an</em> <em>unfilled stomach</em>. The normal way to say that you are doing something without eating first is to say you&rsquo;re doing something <em>on an empty stomach</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Next she said she likes to eat <em>a complete English breakfast</em>. The usual way to describe eggs, bacon, sausage and tomato is <em>a</em> <em>full English breakfast</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Ooh, feeling a bit hungry now. Then she said that going to college <em>takes a big time</em>, but the chunk is <em>to take a long time</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And it takes a long time because it is <em>the rush period</em> &ndash; but the usual expression is <em>the rush hour</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Kirsten told us that class is <em>a lot of enjoyment. </em>But we usually say<em> a lot of fun.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>It&rsquo;s fun because Kirsten&rsquo;s friends come from <em>all over the earth</em> &ndash; normally <em>all over the world</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And let&rsquo;s listen to the last sentence again. <strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong>Anyway, I must go into class right now, but I&rsquo;ll be <em>back in a period</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So she&rsquo;ll return soon to talk more, but the usual way to say this is <em>back in a bit</em>. Or <em>back in a minute</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Great stuff. So, let&rsquo;s listen to Kirsten again, this time with all the correct chunks of language.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong>My typical morning? Well, I never go out <em>on an</em> <em>empty stomach</em>, so before class, I usually have a <em>full English breakfast </em>&ndash; I love it. Getting to class can <em>take a long time</em> because it is<em> the rush hour. </em>But when I get to class it&rsquo;s a <em>lot of fun </em>because my classmates come from<em> all over the world. </em>Anyway, I must go into class right now, but I&rsquo;ll be <em>back in a bit</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well done Kirsten. It sounded much more natural that time.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT<br/></strong>You&rsquo;re listening to bbclearningenglish.com.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So, now it&rsquo;s time for a quiz. You have to finish the sentences with the correct chunk. Number 1. <em>I want to learn Chinese, but I think it will&hellip; a) have a long time; b) take a great age; c) take a long time.</em></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>The natural way to say it is: c) <em>take a long time.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Now number 2. <em>People are learning English&hellip; a) all over the world; b) around the earth; c) throughout the planet.</em></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>People are learning English: a) <em>all over the world.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well done if you got that.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That brings us almost to the end of today&rsquo;s show.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>But before we go, here&rsquo;s today&rsquo;s top tip &ndash; instead of learning lists of vocabulary word by word, try picking up natural chunks of language that you hear people using. Learning these chunks will make your English sound much more natural.</p>

"<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me Finn…</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>And me Alice. And today’s show is all about binomials.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Or as some call them, binomials. Yes, those short and sweet phrases English speakers love to use in everyday English. We’ll look at what binomials are, what they mean and how to use them.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>There’ll be a cheap and cheerful quiz…</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>And we’ll leave you with a quick and dirty tip for learning vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>So: to start off, let’s listen to Charlie and his mum talking about football practice.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Here’s a question to think about while you listen: what’s a good treatment for aches and pains?</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>What’s good for aches and pains? Let’s find out.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Mum<br></strong>Hello, love. How was practice today?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie<br></strong>Horrible. I hate football.</p>
<p><strong>Mum<br></strong>Oh dear. Why’s that?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie<br></strong>I’m sick and tired of being in goal. Look at these bruises – I’m black and blue.</p>
<p><strong>Mum<br></strong>Let’s have a look…oh yes love, why don't you jump in the bath? Warm water’s very good for aches and pains.</p>
<p><strong>STING</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>So, that’s Charlie and his mum. And we asked you: what’s good for <em>aches and pains</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>And Charlie’s mum says the answer is: a warm bath.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>That’s right. And the phrase <em>aches and pains</em> is our first <strong>binomial</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Now binomials are short English phrases made of two words that go together – and the two words are often joined with <em>and</em>. Like <em>aches and pains.</em> Which means: general pains in the body, that usually aren’t serious.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Ok: now it’s important to remember that binomials are always fixed: you can’t change anything about them. You can’t say <em>pains and aches</em>. You can’t say <em>aches and hurts</em> and you can’t say <em>hurts and pains</em>. So, Alice: Do you suffer from <em>aches and pains</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Sometimes Finn, when you're around. Anyway, poor Charlie said he was <em>black and blue</em>. He’s talking about the bruises on his body he got from playing football.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong><em>Black and blue</em>? Must have been a tough game…?</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes, no wonder Charlie said he’s <em>sick and tired</em> of football.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong></p>
<p><em>Sick and tired</em>. It means really fed up and bored with something. And remember, we can’t say <em>tired and sick.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>We can’t say <em>sick and bored </em>either. What are you sick and tired of at the moment Finn?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>I'm sick and tired of commuting: travelling to work. It took me about an hour this morning.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>That's a really long time.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>And another binomial: <em>bit by bit</em> - this time, the word in the middle is <em>by</em> instead of <em>and.</em></p>
<p><strong>IDENT<br></strong>You’re listening to bbclearningenglish.com.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>And we’re talking about binomials. And if you were listening carefully at the beginning of the show you might have noticed that we used a couple of binominals right at the start. <em>Short and sweet</em> was one of them – it means simple, quick and useful.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong><em>Short and sweet </em>or<em>: quick and dirty. </em>That’s another binomial with a similar meaning: <em>quick and dirty</em> means simple, short and basic.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>And another similar one is: <em>cheap and cheerful</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>So, three binomials there you can use to describe something as quick, simple and basic.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Now let’s hear today’s expressions again. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong><em>Aches and pains</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>It describes body pains that aren’t serious.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong><em>Sick and tired.</em></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Fed up, bored and angry.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong><em>Bit by bit</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>To describe slow change. And to say something is simple, short and basic we had three binomials:</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong><em>Short and sweet; quick and dirty; cheap and cheerful.</em></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Thank you Alice: And now it’s quiz time. Number 1. Choose the correct answer: <em>I’m learning French. It’s difficult, but I’m getting better </em>a) <em>bit by bit</em> b) <em>bit</em> <em>by little</em> c) <em>bit</em> <em>and bit.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>And the answer is: a)<em> bit by bit.</em></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Number 2. <em>Sarah fell over and hit her eye yesterday. Today it’s </em>a)<em> blue and black </em>b)<em> black and blue </em>c) <em>black and white.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>And the answer is: b) <em>black</em> <em>and blue.</em></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Ouch. And finally, number 3. At only one minute long, the presentation was a) <em>sweet and short</em> b) <em>cheerful and cheap</em> or c) <em>quick and dirty.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>And the answer is: c) <em>quick and dirty.</em></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>And that brings us almost to the end of the programme.</p>
<p><strong>Alice<br></strong>But before we go, here’s a cheap and cheerful tip for remembering vocabulary: play games. Making and playing a simple card game where you match up the beginning and ends of binomials will really help you to remember them.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>That's right. And there’s more about this at BBC Learning English dot com. Join us again for more 6 Minute Vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Both<br></strong>Goodbye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I&rsquo;m Finn&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And I&rsquo;m Catherine. In today&rsquo;s programme we&rsquo;re going to look at <strong>i-n-g</strong>and <strong>e-d</strong> adjectives.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So if you&rsquo;re <strong>interested</strong> in vocabulary, but you find some adjectives <strong>confusing</strong>, keep listening&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, keep listening, and it&rsquo;s on with the show! I must say Finn, you&rsquo;re looking very <strong>relaxed</strong> today.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That&rsquo;s because I was on holiday last week. It was very <strong>relaxing</strong>. Speaking of holidays, here are two people who had a bad time on holiday. What went wrong?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Man<br/></strong>The train was horrible. Big gangs of teenagers playing music on their phones &ndash; I got very <strong>annoyed</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Woman<br/></strong>The flight was delayed and we had ten really <strong>boring</strong> hours in the airport with nothing to do.</p>
<p><strong>STING</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Not much fun, eh? So, the man was <strong>annoyed</strong>, or angry, about teenagers playing music. And the woman had a long and <strong>boring</strong> wait in the airport.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So let&rsquo;s have a closer look. Here&rsquo;s the woman again.</p>
<p><strong>REPEAT INSERT </strong></p>
<p><strong>Woman<br/></strong>The flight was delayed and we had ten really <strong>boring</strong> hours in the airport with nothing to do.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Now adjectives ending with <strong>i-n-g, </strong>like<strong> boring,</strong> usually describe things or events that make us have a particular feeling.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That&rsquo;s right, and in the example, <strong>boring</strong> describes all those hours and hours in the airport. Ten long, <strong>boring</strong> hours. Sound familiar Finn?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That sounds very familiar, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And there are lots of <strong>i-n-g</strong> adjectives we can use to describe things or events. We can talk about a <strong>confusing</strong> problem, a <strong>surprising</strong> piece of news or an <strong>exciting</strong> film with lots of action. Finn, what&rsquo;s the most <strong>exciting</strong> film you have ever seen?</p>
<p><strong>Finn &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/></strong>So many exciting films. But the first one I can think of is Gravity. In space. Very exciting. Ok Catherine, what is your idea of a <strong>relaxing</strong> holiday?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I do like to be beside the seaside, Finn. Now let&rsquo;s look at <strong>e-d</strong> adjectives. We're going to hear from a woman who got a very cheap holiday. What <strong>e-d</strong> adjective does she use?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong>We got a great deal. I was <strong>surprised</strong> at how cheap it was.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We use <strong>e-d</strong> adjectives to say how we feel about something. In our example, the adjective <strong>surprised</strong> describes how the woman feels about the price.</p>
<p><strong>REPEAT INSERT<br/></strong>We got a great deal. I was <strong>surprised</strong> at how cheap it was.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>She didn&rsquo;t expect it to be so cheap!</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That&rsquo;s right. If I say: <strong>I get annoyed by loud music</strong>, the word <strong>annoyed</strong> describes my feelings about the music. The music is <strong>annoying</strong>, and I feel <strong>annoyed</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And if I say: <strong>long lectures make me bored,</strong> the word <strong>bored </strong>describes my feelings about the lecture. The lecture is <strong>boring</strong>, and I feel <strong>bored</strong>. So, Finn, what makes you <strong>bored</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I never feel bored.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, you do.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Ok, when I'm travelling to work. A long commute is very <strong>boring</strong> and it makes me feel <strong>bored</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Me too. And a word of warning here: don&rsquo;t confuse <strong>bored</strong> and <strong>boring</strong> &ndash; because if you say <strong>I&rsquo;m very boring</strong>, you&rsquo;re actually saying that you make other people feel <strong>bored</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And you don&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT<br/></strong>You&rsquo;re listening to BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And it&rsquo;s time for a quiz. Listen to these sentences and choose whether they need an <strong>i-n-g </strong>or<strong> e-d </strong>adjective. Catherine will tell you the answers. Ready? Number one: &lsquo;I enjoy taking long hot baths. They make me feel really&hellip;&rsquo; a) relaxed or b) relaxing?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now Finn, you&rsquo;re describing your feeling, so it&rsquo;s a) relaxed.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That&rsquo;s right: they make me relaxed. Number two: &lsquo;The discovery of life on Mars would be &hellip;&rsquo; a) <strong>surprised</strong> or b) <strong>surprising</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We&rsquo;re talking about a discovery, which is a thing, so it&rsquo;s b) <strong>surprising</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And the last one: &lsquo;Those students are very &hellip;&rsquo; a) <strong>annoying</strong> or b) <strong>annoyed</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And this one is a trick question, because both of them are possible: <strong>Those students are very annoying</strong> is correct if we are describing <strong>the students</strong>.But <strong>Those students are very annoyed</strong> is what we say if we are talking about <strong>the students&rsquo; feelings</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That&rsquo;s right, both are possible. And that brings us almost to the end of the show. But before we go, here&rsquo;s today&rsquo;s top tip for learning vocabulary: <strong>i-n-g</strong> and <strong>e-d</strong> adjectives are easy to confuse, so write down pairs of example sentences in your notebook.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Very good. And remember there&rsquo;s more about this at BBC Learning English dot com. Join us again for more 6 Minute Vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Both<br/></strong>Bye!</p><br><p><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Vocabulary points to take away</strong></p>
<p>Both <strong>&ndash;ing</strong> and <strong>&ndash;ed</strong> adjectives help us to&nbsp;talk about our feelings.</p>
<p>The main difference is that <strong>&ndash;ing</strong> adjectives are usually used to talk about the <strong>person, place </strong>or<strong> thing</strong> that is making us feel a certain way:</p><ul><li>Yawn! This lecture is really <strong>boring</strong>!</li></ul><p>But <strong>&ndash;ed</strong> adjectives are used to talk about how <strong>we</strong> feel:</p><ul><li>I&rsquo;ve been listening to him for hours &ndash; I&rsquo;m so <strong>bored</strong>.</li></ul><p>Be careful:&nbsp;If you&nbsp;say <strong>I am boring</strong> &ndash; it&rsquo;s grammatically correct, but it means that you make other people feel bored!</p>
<p>Here are some common pairs of <strong>-ed</strong> and <strong>-ing</strong> adjectives:</p>
<p><strong>1) exciting </strong>and<strong> excited<br/></strong>We have seen some <strong>exciting</strong> developments in technology recently.</p>
<p>We are <strong>excited&nbsp;</strong>about our new range of smartphones.</p>
<p><strong>2) surprising and surprised</strong></p>
<p>It is <strong>surprising</strong> how little we know about our oceans.</p>
<p>My whole family was there for my party &ndash; I was so <strong>surprised</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>3) annoying </strong>and<strong> annoyed</strong></p>
<p>I hate popup adverts on the internet &ndash; they&rsquo;re <strong>annoying</strong>!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, I know you&rsquo;re <strong>annoyed </strong>&ndash; I won&rsquo;t make that mistake again!</p>
<p><strong>4) relaxing </strong>and<strong> relaxed</strong></p>
<p>Some people find listening to classical music very <strong>relaxing</strong>.</p>
<p>Doing yoga makes me feel more <strong>relaxed</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>5)&nbsp;confusing </strong>and<strong> confused</strong></p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t understand the story in&nbsp;that film &ndash; it was too <strong>confusing</strong>.</p>
<p>If too many people are talking at&nbsp;the same time,&nbsp;I get <strong>confused</strong>.</p>"
"<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Catherine...</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And I'm Finn, hello.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Today's programme is all about <strong>lexical sets.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That's right: <strong>lexical sets</strong> help us to learn words by grouping them together by topic or word type. So, more on that later, but first, here's Dave. He's talking about a flood that happened in his home town recently, and here's a question to answer while you listen: what happened to all of Dave's possessions?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT</strong></p>
<p><strong> Dave<br/> </strong>Well, we had so much <strong>rain</strong>: it said on the news we got a month's <strong>rainfall</strong> in just one day! The <strong>water level</strong> rose so high that the river <strong>burst its banks</strong> and <strong>water</strong> <strong>poured </strong>into everyone's houses. It's terrible - my house was <strong>flooded</strong>, all my things were completely <strong>soaked</strong> and the carpets are still <strong>waterlogged</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Oh, dear. Dave.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yes. We asked you what happened to Dave's possessions...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And he said all his things were completely <strong>soaked</strong> - they were covered in water and now they're all wet and damaged.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Dave also used a few different words to talk about the flood and its effects. He talked about the <strong>rain</strong> and <strong>rainfall</strong> - that's a way to describe the water that falls as rain over a period of time&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And he talked about <strong>water level</strong>, that's the height of the water in rivers and lakes. And Dave said it got very high.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>It did. And that's what caused the <strong>floods</strong>. Now, <strong>floods, water level, water, rainfall </strong>and<strong> rain</strong> - these are all on the topic of <strong>rain</strong> and <strong>floods</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And they're also all the same type of word - they're all nouns. So we can group these words into a <strong>lexical set</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That's right: a <strong>lexical set</strong> is a group of words which are all about the same topic, and which all belong to the same part of speech - they're all nouns or verbs or adjectives.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So, to make a lexical set for activities on a <strong>beach holiday</strong>, for example, you might think of...</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>...<strong>swimming</strong>, <strong>sunbathing</strong>, and <strong>surfing</strong>. What do you like doing on a beach holiday, Catherine?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Me - I like sunbathing and eating ice cream. And swimming, sunbathing, eating ice cream, and surfing are all <strong>gerunds</strong>, that's nouns made from -ing verbs.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Exactly, so: same topic, same word type: that's a lexical set! Lots of people find it useful to learn words in groups like this. They seem to stick in your mind more easily.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right and by learning words in lexical sets, you'll also have more words to choose from when you're talking about a topic. Let's hear Dave again and see if you can spot another lexical set:</p>
<p><strong>CLIP FROM INSERT<br/></strong>...my house was <strong>flooded</strong>, all my things were completely <strong>soaked</strong> and the carpets are still <strong>waterlogged</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Did you get it? Dave said his house was <strong>flooded</strong> - full of water; all his things were <strong>soaked</strong> - completely wet; and his carpets still have lots of water in them - they are <strong>waterlogged</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>The words <strong>flooded</strong>, <strong>soaked</strong> and <strong>waterlogged</strong> are all adjectives here, and they're all about flooding, so -</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>- there's our next lexical set!</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>There it is!</p>
<p><strong>IDENT<br/></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And we're talking about lexical sets: groups of words related to the same topic that come from the same part of speech, like nouns, verbs, adjectives, gerunds.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That's right, and it's time for a quiz.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Aha! My favourite. Right: I'll say three words and you decide if they make a lexical set or not. Finn will tell you the answers. Ready? Number one. Tea, coffee, water. Lexical set or not?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well, they're all drinks - so the same topic - and they're all nouns, so they're a lexical set.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>They are. Another one: swimming, cleaning, sunbathing.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And that's not a lexical set. They are all gerunds, but the topic seems to be 'holiday activities' like <strong>swimming</strong> and <strong>sunbathing</strong> - and <strong>cleaning</strong> doesn't really fit with that group. Not on my holidays, anyway...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Not on mine, either. So, well done if you got those right at home. And we've just got time for a quick vocabulary tip. Finn?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>OK, right, here we go: find a friend, and play a game of 'lexical set tennis'. It goes like this. You choose a topic, like <strong>sport</strong>, and then choose a word group like <strong>nouns</strong> - and then you take it in turns to say words in the set. Alright Catherine: shall we try this?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>Yes, come on then...</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>The topic is sport and I'll start with football.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>Rugby.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>Boxing.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>Basketball.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>Err. Err. Oh no! There's more about this at&nbsp;bbclearningenglish.com. Join us again for more 6 Minute Vocabulary. And I've got another one.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>Come on then.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/> </strong>Golf...</p><br><h3><strong>Vocabulary points to take away</strong></h3><p>A <strong>lexical set</strong> is a group of words that share the same topic or theme and belong to the same part of speech - they are all nouns, all verbs, all adjectives (for example).</p>
<p>Lexical sets are a useful way to organise vocabulary, making it easier to learn. When reading texts from different sources, it is a good idea to try to find groups of words that are related to the same topic and that belong to the same part of speech.</p>"
"<p><span><strong>Finn <br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Finn&hellip;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></strong>And I'm Catherine. In today&rsquo;s programme we're looking at compound adjectives, like in <strong>a 22-hour journey</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></strong>We&rsquo;ll look at what compound adjectives are&hellip;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></strong>&hellip; we&rsquo;ll see how to use them&hellip;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></strong>There'll be a punctuation tip and a quiz...</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></strong>And we'll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>But first, let's hear from Rob. Rob's a racing driver and he's being interviewed after a race.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>And here's a question to think about while you listen: how fast was Rob's lap time?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span> <br/>Let's find out.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>INSERT</strong><strong><br/></strong></span><strong><span>Interviewer</span></strong><span>&nbsp; <br/>Rob, congratulations on your latest win. What did that last victory mean to you?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>Honestly, I expected to win. I mean, you don't come second in a high-quality vehicle like mine.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Interviewer</span></strong><span>&nbsp; <br/>That's true - it's an impressive motor - but what you did was amazing: your fastest lap time was truly incredible. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>Well, you're right. You don't see a seventy-second lap every day.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Interviewer</span></strong><span>&nbsp; <br/>Thanks for your time Rob. Well, this year the drivers are hoping to complete the four-kilometre course in an even faster time...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>STING</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>So, Rob the racing driver did a seventy-second lap.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>Well done if you got that right. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>And that's our first example of a compound adjective. It's made with a number, like <strong>seventy</strong>, and a noun, like <strong>second</strong>. <strong>Seventy-second</strong>. We put seventy-second in front of another noun, like <strong>lap</strong>, making a compound adjective which describes a noun. <strong>A seventy-second lap.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>Let's hear another example, again starting with a number, but this time the noun describes length instead of time.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><strong><span>Interviewer<br/></span></strong><span>Well, this year the drivers are hoping to complete the <strong>four-kilometre</strong> course in an even faster time.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>So the number <strong>four</strong>, with the noun <strong>kilometre</strong>, go together to make an adjective: <strong>four-kilometre</strong>. And take note: there's no <strong>s</strong> at the end of <strong>kilometre</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>That's right: there's no <strong>s</strong> because the word <strong>kilometre</strong> functions as an adjective here - and we can't make adjectives plural. The adjective <strong>four-kilometre</strong> describes the noun <strong>course</strong>. <strong>A four-kilometre course.</strong><br/></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>Some more examples with length are...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/><strong>A 26-mile race; a six-foot man.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></strong>Now for a punctuation note. When you write a number-noun compound adjective, you need to join the two parts together with a hyphen - a little horizontal line between the two words. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></strong>That's right. So you write <strong>a seventy-second lap. A six-foot man.</strong> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>STING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></span></strong><span>You're listening to BBC Learning English.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And we're talking about compound adjectives. Here's Rob again. Listen out for another type of compound adjective.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Honestly, I expected to win. I mean, you don't come second in a<strong> high-quality</strong> vehicle like mine.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></strong>Did you get that? It was <strong>high-quality</strong>. <strong>A high-quality vehicle</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></strong>So, as well as using numbers, we can also make compound adjectives with the words <strong>high</strong> or <strong>low</strong> plus a noun.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>High</strong> plus <strong>quality</strong> equals <strong>high-quality</strong>. Like <strong>high-quality vehicle</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>Low</strong> plus <strong>cost</strong> equals <strong>low-cost</strong>. Like <strong>low-cost airline</strong>. How do you feel about low-cost airlines, Catherine?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></strong>After my last experience, never again... Some more examples are, Finn?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Finn <br/>High-speed</strong>. <strong>A high-speed motorbike.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></strong>And<strong> low-fat. A low-fat yoghurt.</strong> And if you're writing, remember to join the 2 parts together with a hyphen.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn &nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></strong>And now it's quiz time. Complete these sentences. Catherine will tell you the answers. Ready? Number one. In a balanced diet, it's important to eat ... a) high-quality carbohydrates or b) high-qualities carbohydrates.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></strong>It's a) <strong>high-quality carbohydrates.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></strong>Well done if you got that. Number two. The flight from London to New York is ... a) a nines-hour trip or b) a nine-hour trip.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></strong>The answer's b) <strong>a nine-hour trip</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></strong>Number three. Every morning, Catherine goes for a) a six-mile run or b) a six-miles run.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></strong>The answer's a) <strong>a six-mile run</strong>. But&nbsp;I don't.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn</strong><br/>You don't really, do you?</span></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>No.</p>
<p><span><strong>Finn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></strong>In any case, well done if you got that right at home. And we're almost at the end of the show. But before we go, here's today's top tip for learning vocabulary, which is, Catherine...</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></strong>If you use social media, join an English learning group. When you learn a new word, try to include it in at least 3 of your posts. That will help you remember the word.</span></p>

"<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Catherine&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And I'm Finn. Catherine, look at this photo &ndash; do you like it? I took it this morning.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Wow, Finn. That's not bad. I didn't know you were into photography.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well, I love taking photographs.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Really? Well funnily enough, the words <strong>photography</strong> and <strong>photograph</strong> are good examples of today's topic, which is word stress. We&rsquo;re going to look at the way word stress can change in words that come from the same root word.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>We'll show you how to work out the stress of these words...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>There'll be a quiz...</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And we'll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>But first, let's listen to John. He's a <strong>photographer</strong>, which is a person who takes photographs as a job. He's talking about his latest project.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Here's a question to think about while you listen: what's John's project?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>John<br/></strong>The book is a collection of photographs of my father. He studied <strong>geography</strong> as a young man and went all over the world during his career. He visited some very interesting <strong>geographic</strong> locations &ndash; the Andes, the Sahara &ndash; beautiful places. The book's like a <strong>photographic </strong>&nbsp;record of his life &ndash; a kind of a <strong>biography</strong> in pictures.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So, that's John. We asked you: what was his project?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the answer is: a biography.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>A biography is the story of someone's life &ndash; usually a book.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>But, John's a photographer, so he told the story of his father's life in photographs. Let&rsquo;s hear a clip.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1<br/></strong>He studied geography as a young man&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>John's dad was interested in geography: the study of the physical features of the earth. And geography is a key word in today's show because of its stress.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes. Now, geography has four syllables, ge-<strong>o-</strong>gra-phy, and the stress falls on the third syllable from the end. Ge<strong>o</strong>graphy, not <strong>ge</strong>ography, geo<strong>gra</strong>phy or geogra<strong>phy</strong>. It&rsquo;s ge<strong>o</strong>graphy.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Words that end in the letters p-h-y - pronounced 'fee' - usually have this stress pattern. Like bi<strong>o</strong>graphy and phot<strong>o</strong>graphy. Do you like phot<strong>o</strong>graphy, Catherine?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>To be honest, not really.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Not really? Sorry to hear that.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>No, never mind. Anyway, these words &ndash; like geography, biography and photography - are all nouns. We can change them to adjectives, by changing the y at the end to i-c &ndash; pronounced 'ik'. And when we do this, the word stress moves to a different place in the word. Here's John again.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br/></strong>He studied ge<strong>o</strong>graphy as a young man [&hellip;] He visited some very interesting geo<strong>graph</strong>ic locations&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Did you hear the difference? When we say adjectives that end with i-c, the stress falls on the penultimate syllable, that's the syllable just before the last one. So it's ge<strong>o</strong>graphy, but geo<strong>graph</strong>ic.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Ge<strong>o</strong>graphy, geo<strong>graph</strong>ic. And we have phot<strong>o</strong>graphy, pho-to-<strong>graph-</strong>ic&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And there are other words like dra<strong>ma</strong>tic, to do with theatre and drama; alpha<strong>bet</strong>ic, to do with the alphabet, and ar<strong>tis</strong>tic, to describe things to do with art. Finn, are you artistic?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well, I like to think of myself as quite artistic, yes. And Catherine, what's the most interesting geographic location you've been to?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It's a lovely place in Turkey called &Ouml;l&uuml;deniz.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT<br/></strong>You&rsquo;re listening to BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And we're talking about word stress. We've looked at the stress patterns of words that end with p-h-y, like pho<strong>to</strong>graphy.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And words ending with i-c, like photo<strong>graph</strong>ic.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And now, it's time for a quiz. Choose the correct pronunciation for the words in these sentences. Catherine will tell you the answers. Ready? Number 1. I like reading books about famous people. I love a good a) <strong>bi</strong>ography, b) bi<strong>o</strong>graphy or c) biogra<strong>phy</strong>?&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And it's b) bi<strong>o</strong>graphy.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well done if you got that right. Number 2. 'The police arrested him when they found &hellip; a) pho<strong>to</strong>graphic evidence, b) photograph<strong>ic</strong> evidence or c) photo<strong>graph</strong>ic evidence.'</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the answer is - c) photo<strong>graph</strong>ic evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And that&rsquo;s the end of the quiz.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And that almost brings us to the end of the programme.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>But before we go, here's today&rsquo;s top tip for learning vocabulary: if you use an online dictionary, you can usually hear an audio recording of a word&rsquo;s pronunciation. Listen carefully to the word stress and try to copy it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Top tip, Finn.</p>

"<p><span><strong>Neil <br/></strong>Hi! </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Hello!</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil <br/></strong></span><span>..and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. My name is Neil, and I&rsquo;m one of the presenters today.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>And I&rsquo;m Sophie, and I&rsquo;m the other presenter. Welcome to the show!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil </span></strong><strong><br/></strong><span>Did you hear that word - <strong>presenter</strong>? Today we&rsquo;re going to be talking about jobs, and the different kinds of English words for different jobs. Like <strong>presenter</strong>, for example.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>We&rsquo;ll look at some of the different ways that words for jobs can end, like the &lsquo;er&rsquo;&nbsp; at the end of <strong>presenter</strong>. These are called suffixes.<br/></span><strong><span><br/>Neil <br/></span></strong><span>As usual, we&rsquo;ll be giving you a quiz to see how much you can remember&hellip;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>And we&rsquo;ll also bring you a top tip to help you learn vocabulary.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil </span></strong><strong><br/></strong><span>But first, let&rsquo;s listen to Anna. She&rsquo;s going to tell us about the different jobs she&rsquo;s had in her life so far.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>While you listen, think about this question: what is Anna&rsquo;s job now?<br/><br/></span><strong><span>INSERT<br/>Anna<br/></span></strong><span>When I was a little girl, I always wanted to be a <strong>teacher</strong>. So I spent years training as a <strong>teacher</strong>, and then I got a job in a school&hellip; and I hated it! After a few months I quit. I worked for a while as a <strong>librarian</strong>, but I didn&rsquo;t really like that either. Finally I started writing for a small website. Now I work as a <strong>journalist</strong>, writing for newspapers and magazines.</span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>So, that was Anna, talking about all the jobs she&rsquo;s done. And we asked: what&rsquo;s Anna&rsquo;s job now?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil </span></strong><strong><br/></strong><span>Anna is a <strong>journalist</strong> now. She writes for newspapers and magazines.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Well done if you got that right. And another question: Did you catch what Anna&rsquo;s first job was?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil </span></strong><strong><br/></strong><span>She was a <strong>teacher</strong>. Let&rsquo;s listen again&hellip;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT 1 CLIP 1&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br/></strong><span><strong>Anna</strong><br/>When I was a little girl, I always wanted to be a <strong>teacher</strong>. So I spent years training as a <strong>teacher</strong>...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil </span></strong><strong><br/></strong><span>Now, a lot of English words for jobs end with the sound &ndash;er, like <strong>presenter</strong> or <strong>teacher</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, and there are two ways to spell the suffix &ndash;er in job names. Sometimes this is spelled e-r, in words like <strong>presenter</strong> or <strong>teacher</strong>. Or sometimes it&rsquo;s spelled o-r: for example, <strong>actor</strong> or <strong>translator</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil <br/></span></strong><span>So, a <strong>teacher</strong> teaches students, an <strong>actor</strong> acts in a film, a <strong>translator</strong> translates from one language to another, a <strong>train</strong> <strong>driver</strong> drives a train. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re an <strong>actor</strong> aren&rsquo;t you Sophie?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, I am, Neil. But because I&rsquo;m female you can also say I&rsquo;m an <strong>actress</strong>. So, there are lots of jobs that end with that e-r suffix. But now let&rsquo;s look at a different suffix. Can you remember what Anna&rsquo;s next job was, after she quit teaching? Let&rsquo;s listen and check.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br/>Anna<br/></span></strong><span>After a few months I quit. I worked for a while as a <strong>librarian</strong>, but I didn&rsquo;t really like that either.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil </span></strong><strong><br/></strong><span>Next, Anna worked as a <strong>librarian</strong> &ndash; that&rsquo;s someone who works in a library.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Another suffix which we often find at the end of a word for a job is &ndash;ian, spelled i-a-n. Sometimes it&rsquo;s pronounced &lsquo;shun&rsquo;. For example, if you&rsquo;ve got a problem with your eyes, you might need to go to an <strong>optician</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil <br/></span></strong><span>And someone who works in politics is a <strong>politician</strong>. Ever thought of being a politician, Sophie? </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>I can&rsquo;t say I have, Neil. OK, now let&rsquo;s talk about one more suffix. Do you remember what Anna does now? She&rsquo;s a <strong>journalist</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil&nbsp; </span></strong><strong><br/></strong><span>There are also quite a lot of words for jobs in English which end in &ndash;ist, spelled i-s-t.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>The person who greets you in an office or a hotel is a <strong>receptionist</strong>&hellip;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil </span></strong><strong><br/></strong><span>And a person who looks after your teeth is a <strong>dentist</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>IDENT<br/></span></strong><span>You&rsquo;re listening to BBC Learning English.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>And we&rsquo;re talking about jobs suffixes.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil </span></strong><strong><br/></strong><span>Ok. Now it&rsquo;s quiz time! We&rsquo;ve got three questions for you. First, if someone translates from one language to another, are they a) a translatist b) a translator or c) a translatician?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>And the answer is, b) a translator. Well done if you got that right. Second question: which job ends with the letters &ndash;o-r? Is it a) actor; b) teacher or c) presenter?&nbsp;</span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil </span></strong><strong><br/></strong><span>And the answer is <strong>actor</strong>. <strong>Teacher</strong> and <strong>presenter</strong> end with &ndash;e-r. Well done if you got both of those questions right. It&rsquo;s almost time for the end of the show. But before we go, there&rsquo;s just time for a top tip for learning vocabulary.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>When you record a new word, don&rsquo;t just write the word and the translation &ndash; try drawing a picture in your notebook too!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil </span></strong><strong><br/></strong><span>Yes. Drawing a picture can help you remember the word better.</span></p>

"<p><strong>Catherine <br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. My name is Catherine, and I'm here today with our special guest presenter Doug. Welcome to the show Doug.</p>
<p><strong>Doug<br/></strong>Hi Catherine, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I'm fine thank you. How are you Doug?</p>
<p><strong>Doug<br/></strong>Fine.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine <br/></strong>Tell us a bit about yourself Doug - you're originally from Canada, right?</p>
<p><strong>Doug<br/></strong>Yes, I'm from Vancouver, which is in western Canada, but I moved here a long, long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>But you've still got an American English accent I noticed.</p>
<p><strong>Doug<br/></strong>Yes, I haven't lost that.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong> <br/>And that's cool, because this show is all about the differences between British English and American English vocabulary. So, tell me Doug, do Canadians like you speak American English?</p>
<p><strong>Doug<br/></strong>I don't think Canadians would say that. Let's say they speak North American English. But it is very similar.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Fantastic. So American English and British English aren't really that different; I'm British and me and Doug can understand each other perfectly - yes?</p>
<p><strong>Doug<br/></strong>Yes, usually. No, of course we can. Of course we understand you.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong> <br/>We can. But there are a few vocabulary differences between American and British English that it's very helpful to learn. And today, with Doug's help, we're going to take you through some of them. So, over to you Doug...</p>
<p><strong>Doug <br/></strong>OK, thanks Catherine. Let's start with some examples. This is John, from the US, talking about his recent visit to Britain. Here's a question for you while you&rsquo;re listening: Did John enjoy his visit? Here's John.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT John<br/></strong>I went to Britain for two weeks last <strong>fall</strong>. Actually, British people don't say <strong>fall</strong>, they say <strong>autumn</strong>. In the States we pay the <strong>check</strong>, but in Britain they pay the <strong>bill</strong>... we<strong> mail</strong> a letter, but the British <strong>post </strong>a letter... we go to a <strong>store</strong> to buy <strong>candy</strong> and <strong>cookies</strong>, but the British go to a <strong>shop</strong> to buy <strong>sweets </strong>and<strong> biscuits</strong>. But I had a great time there.</p>
<p><strong>Doug </strong><br/>So, the question was: according to John, did he enjoy his visit?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine </strong><br/>And the answer is: yes, he did. He said he had a great time. Well done if you got that right at home. Now, let's have a closer look at some of the vocabulary John used. Here's a clip, and another question for you: what's the name of the season after summer?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></strong>Actually British people don't say <strong>fall</strong>, they say <strong>autumn</strong>...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine <br/></strong>So, in Britain the season after summer is called <strong>autumn</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Doug <br/></strong>Yes, but in American English it's called <strong>fall because the leaves fall</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Fall.</p>
<p><strong>Doug<br/></strong>Next question: when you're in a restaurant, and you've finished the meal, what do you ask for, what do you pay? Listen again:</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></strong>In the States we pay the <strong>check</strong>, but in Britain they pay the <strong>bill</strong>...</p>
<p><strong>Doug <br/></strong>In America, the word is <strong>check</strong>. You pay the <strong>check</strong> at the end of a meal.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong> <br/>You pay the check. But in Britain, we pay the <strong>bill</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Doug</strong> <br/>Here's another difference between British and American English: what do we do when we 'send a letter'? Can you remember the British word, or the American word, or both? Listen again:</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></strong>...we<strong> mail</strong> a letter, but the British <strong>post </strong>a letter...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong> <br/>So, in Britain we <strong>post</strong> a letter, but Doug, North Americans say...?</p>
<p><strong>Doug<br/></strong><strong>Mail</strong> a letter. OK, now, John said that British people go to a <strong>shop</strong> to buy <strong>sweets </strong>and<strong> biscuits</strong>. Well, where do Americans go, and what do they buy there? Listen one more time:</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 5<br/></strong>...we go to a <strong>store</strong> to buy <strong>candy </strong>and<strong> cookies</strong>...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>The British say <strong>shop</strong>...</p>
<p><strong>Doug</strong> <br/>...but the Americans say <strong>store</strong>...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>...the British say <strong>sweets</strong>...</p>
<p><strong>Doug</strong> <br/>...but the Americans say <strong>candy</strong>...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>...the British say <strong>biscuits</strong>...</p>
<p><strong>Doug</strong> <br/>...and in North America, that's <strong>cookies.</strong></p>
<p><strong>IDENT</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary, from <a href=""bbclearningenglish.com"">bbclearningenglish.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Doug <br/></strong>And our topic for today is British and American vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Doug - a question for you: A lot of learners of English want to know which one is better - is it British English or American English? What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Doug<br/></strong>To be honest, there's no difference - just use the one you like.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And now it's time for a quiz. Doug is going to say an American English word, and you have to say the British English word with the same meaning.</p>
<p><strong>Doug</strong> <br/>OK, so, the first American English word is <strong>check</strong>. What's the British word for <strong>check</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong> <br/>And the answer is: <strong>bill</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Doug</strong> <br/>Next word: <strong>candy</strong>. What do British people say instead of <strong>candy</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong> <br/>And the British word for <strong>candy </strong>is<strong> sweets</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Doug</strong> <br/>Good, and the last American word is <strong>mail</strong>. What's the British word for <strong>mail</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong> <br/> The British word for <strong>mail</strong> is <strong>post</strong>. And that's all our questions for today. Before we go, here's a tip to help you with your vocabulary studies.</p>
<p><strong>Doug</strong> <br/>Yes - people speak English with many different accents: Australian, Indian, Nigerian, Singaporean, West Indian... so, it's a good idea to practice listening to lots of accents, not only British accents or American English! It's easy to find examples of many different accents, just go online!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine <br/></strong>Top tip Doug, thanks very much and thanks for being with us us today. Well, that's the end of the programme, but there's lots more about this at <a href=""http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/"">bbclearningenglish.com</a>.

<p><strong>Both<br/></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I&rsquo;m Neil &hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>And I&rsquo;m Catherine. And our topic today is business jargon &ndash; that&rsquo;s words and phrases you hear mostly in the world of business. So Neil, are you ready for some <strong>blue-sky thinking</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong><strong>Blue-sky thinking</strong> &ndash; that&rsquo;s an expression often heard in the workplace. It means <strong>being creative</strong> &ndash; coming up with new, original ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Exactly, and in this programme we&rsquo;ve got lots more business phrases for you. We&rsquo;ll explain what they mean and when to use them.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But first, listen to Sophie, talking to her marketing team.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>And here&rsquo;s a question to think about while you listen: What does Sophie ask Joe to do?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong>Good: it seems we&rsquo;re all <strong>reading from the same page</strong>. We need to reach the <strong>upscale</strong> customers. So, can we <strong>think out of the box</strong> and come up with something quite different? We have to <strong>push the envelope </strong>if we want to succeed in the market. Now, if we take <strong>the helicopter view</strong>, we can see that we&rsquo;ve <strong>effected</strong> lower costs. We&rsquo;ve targeted <strong>low-hanging fruit </strong>and got rid of several distributers. <strong>Going forward </strong>now, Joe, can you <strong>action</strong> advertising? Is everyone clear now?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>Lots of business jargon there. We usually don&rsquo;t use so many at one time, do we Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, it can sound a bit much if you use all of them. Though these are things you probably will hear in a business context.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Most definitely. So back to our question. We asked you: What does Sophie asked Joe to do?</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And the answer is: She asks him to <strong>action</strong> advertising.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That&rsquo;s right. She wants him to deal with advertising. Sophie used the noun <strong>action </strong>as a verb &ndash; more on that later. But first let&rsquo;s look at some jargon she used to talk about having new ideas. Here&rsquo;s a clip.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br/></strong>So, can we <strong>think out of the box</strong> and come up with something quite different? We have to <strong>push the envelope </strong>if we want to succeed in the market<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So Sophie wants her team to come up with a new and exciting idea. And she uses the expression <strong>think out of the box</strong>, which means <strong>be creative; don&rsquo;t feel limited to the same old ideas</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And she tells them to <strong>push the envelope</strong>,which means <strong>go further than before; do things that might be new or risky</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, that&rsquo;s similar to that expression we had earlier &ndash; <strong>blue-sky thinking</strong>, which means <strong>being creative &ndash; coming up with new and original ideas, even if they are not very practical or realistic</strong>. So Neil, are you a <strong>blue-sky thinker</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh, yes, of course, I&rsquo;m incredible creative, you know.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I do. Yes, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Sophie also said everyone was <strong>reading from the same page</strong>. Now this expression means they all<strong> had similar ideas and agreed with each other. </strong>Here&rsquo;s another clip.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br/></strong>Now if we <strong>take the helicopter view</strong>, we can see that we&rsquo;ve <strong>effected</strong> lower costs. We&rsquo;ve targeted <strong>low-hanging fruit</strong> and got rid of several distributers.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Some interesting phrases there, and you can guess their meaning if you actually picture what the words mean. For example, <strong>take the helicopter view</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Exactly. Now, picture yourself up in the sky in a helicopter and you&rsquo;re looking down at the ground &ndash; and you can see a lot more from up there than you can see when you&rsquo;re down on the ground. So this expression means: <strong>looking at the whole situation and not just one or two details</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Sophie also said that they&rsquo;d lowered costs by targeting <strong>low-hanging fruit</strong>. <strong>Low-hanging fruit</strong> means <strong>the easiest, or most obvious, things</strong>. In reality, on a fruit tree, the fruit that hangs low down is easier to pick, so there&rsquo;s a link between this idea and the idiomatic meaning of the phrase in a business situation.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Good. Now, Sophie used two nouns as verbs: <strong>effect</strong> and <strong>action</strong>. She said: <strong>We&rsquo;ve effected lower costs</strong>. And <strong>to</strong> <strong>effect</strong> means <strong>to achieve something</strong>. She also asked Joe to <strong>action</strong> advertising, this means she wants him to deal with the advertising. And nouns used as verbs like this sound very strong. They give the speaker&rsquo;s ideas greater force.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Sophie used the word <strong>upscale</strong> to describe customers. <strong>Upscale </strong>describes people with money or things that are high quality.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I often think that we could do with some <strong>upscale </strong>coffee in our office.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That&rsquo;s a good idea.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>And it&rsquo;s time for a quiz. Number one: If I want you to be creative and original, would I tell you to a) <strong>push the envelope</strong> or b) target<strong> low-hanging fruit</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>And the answer is a)<strong> push the envelope.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>Well done if you got that right. Number two: If I want you to look at the wider picture and not concentrate on detail, would I tell you to a) <strong>think out of the box</strong> or b) <strong>take the helicopter view</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And it&rsquo;s b) <strong>take the helicopter view.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Good. And finally, if I want you to do something, would I ask you to: a) <strong>action </strong>it or b) <strong>effect</strong> it.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>And the answer is a)<strong> action</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well done if you got those right. And before we go, here&rsquo;s a top tip for learning vocabulary: when you learn new words, make a picture in your head of the meaning. And when you hear or see the word again, you can think of the picture.</p>

"<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Hello! And welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me Neil&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>&hellip; and me Catherine. Today we&rsquo;re talking about how to pronounce words that begin with the letter c.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>We'll look at lots of examples&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>&hellip;we'll give you a quiz and we'll leave you with a top tip for remembering new&nbsp;English words.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>So, to start off, let's listen to Maria. She works in a circus &ndash; do you like circuses Catherine?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>When I was a kid I think I wanted to join a circus. These days I'm not so sure. Performing animals not my thing really.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Well Maria is a circus performer - she's not an animal - and we're going to hear her talking about how she started in the job.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>And here's a question to think about while you listen:</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>What didn't Maria do at weekends? Here she is.</p>
<p><strong>Maria</strong><br/>I started performing in my family's circus when I was nine years old. I loved it. At the weekends, me and my sisters didn't go to cybercafes or the cinema or hang around the park smoking cigarettes like other teenagers. We practised performing. I celebrated my 16th birthday by learning to ride a cycle that was only 20 centimetres high! My brother's bike was so high it reached the ceiling!</p>
<p><strong>STING</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>So Maria had an interesting childhood, didn't she?! And we asked you: what didn't she do at weekends?</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And the answer is: She didn't go to the park or the cinema like other kids.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>No. She practised performing. And cinema is an important word in the show today because we spell it with a letter c, but we pronounce it with a /s/ sound. We don't say 'kinema', it&rsquo;s cinema. A lot of words that start with the letter c are pronounced with a /k/ sound, like cake&hellip; crime, count, my name Catherine, card, lots of them&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>But most words that start with the letters c-i are pronounced with a /s/ sound. Words like cinema, cigarette, and circus. And that's rule one. Listen again.</p>
<p><strong>Maria</strong><br/>I started performing in my family&rsquo;s circus when I was nine years old. I loved it. At the weekends, me and my sisters didn't go to cybercafes or the cinema or hang around the park smoking cigarettes like other teenagers.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Good. Now let's see how we pronounce words that start with the letters c-e. Listen to this clip and see if you can spot those words.</p>
<p><strong>Maria</strong><br/>I celebrated my 16th birthday by learning to ride a cycle that was only 20 centimetres high! My brother's bike was so high it reached the ceiling!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>So we had three c-e words there: all pronounced with a /s/ sound. We had celebrate, centimetre and ceiling. That's our second rule.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And perhaps you spotted our third rule in that last clip&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>Yes, well done if you've already noticed that words like cycle and cybercaf&eacute; are pronounced with a /s/ sound even though they are spelt with c-y. Here's the whole clip again.</p>
<p><strong>Maria</strong><br/>I started performing in my family's circus when I was nine years old. I loved it. At the weekends, me and my sisters didn't go to cybercafes or the cinema or hang around the park smoking cigarettes like other teenagers. We practised performing. I celebrated my 16th birthday by learning to ride a cycle that was only 20 centimetres high! My brother's bike was so high it reached the ceiling!</p>
<p><strong>IDENT</strong><br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And we're talking about how to spell words that begin with the /s/ sound. When a word starts with the letters c-e, c-i or c-y, we usually pronounce it with a /s/ sound.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>Right, it's quiz time! How many words in these sentences are spelt with the letter c at the beginning? Number one, listen carefully. I can't see my cycle anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And there were two words with c at the beginning &ndash; can't and cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>Excellent! Number two: Christopher has gone to the cinema but Colin is coming to the cybercaf&eacute;.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>There were five that time: Christopher, cinema, Colin, coming, cybercaf&eacute;.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>OK. And get ready for number three: Crazy coloured circus clowns create chaos in cinema circles.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And that was a whopping eight words beginning with the letter c. Crazy, coloured, circus, clowns, create, chaos, cinema, circles.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>And congratulations if you got them all right! That's the end of the quiz.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And here's a top tip to help you with new vocabulary. When you learn a new group of words, try to put them together in one long crazy sentence like you heard earlier. It'll help you to remember them.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>Top tip, Neil! There&rsquo;s more about this at bbclearningenglish.com. Join us again for more 6 Minute Vocabulary</p>
<p><strong>Both</strong><br/>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Rob <br/></strong>Hi! I'm Rob&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>...and I'm Catherine. Hello! Welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Our subject for today is onomatopoeia. That means, words that sound like the thing they mean. And Catherine and I will be trying to demonstrate some of these words today.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, like that sound most people's phones make when you get a text messages. We call that sound a <strong>beep</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Beep!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's it Rob, yeah. That's onomatopoeia: the word sounds like the thing it means. <strong>Beep!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong><strong>Beep beep!</strong> Yes, have I got a message? Hold on. Right, OK. There are lots of examples of onomatopoeia in the English language, and we'll take a look at some of them on today's show.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So let's start with a clip of Oliver. And he's talking about living in the city.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>While you listen, try to answer this question: How does Oliver feel about city life?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Oliver<br/></strong>It's too noisy for me! All the cars <strong>z</strong><strong>ooming </strong>around and <strong>honking</strong> their horns, music <strong>blaring</strong> in shops, machines <strong>buzzing</strong> and <strong>bleeping</strong>&hellip; even at night, it isn't quiet, you can still hear the fridge <strong>humming</strong>, and the <strong>rumble</strong> of the traffic outside. Then I wish I was far away from the city, sleeping in a tent, with no sound except the <strong>rustle</strong> of the wind in the trees.</p>
<p><strong>STING</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So that's Oliver. And we asked you how he feels about city life.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And Oliver said it's too noisy for him.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I know how he feels &ndash; London: same. Anyway, here's another question: what words did Oliver use to talk about the sounds of the city in the daytime? Listen again.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1<br/></strong>All the cars <strong>zooming </strong>around and <strong>honking</strong> their horns, music <strong>blaring</strong> in shops, machines <strong>buzzing</strong> and <strong>bleeping.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Lots of lovely vocabulary there! Oliver talked about cars<strong> zooming </strong>around.<strong> Zoom, </strong>spelt&nbsp;<strong>z - o &ndash; o &ndash; m - </strong>is a verb, which means 'to move very quickly, making a <strong>zooming </strong>sound'.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Zoom, zoom.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Watch out!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Then he mentioned the cars <strong>honking</strong> their horns. A <strong>honk &ndash; </strong>spelt<strong> h &ndash; o &ndash; n &ndash; k -</strong> is a short, loud sound &ndash; like a car horn makes. <strong>Honk honk!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK, next, Oliver talked about music <strong>blaring</strong>. The verb to<strong> blare: </strong>that's<strong> b &ndash; l &ndash; a &ndash; r &ndash; e,</strong> means 'to make a loud, unpleasant sound' &ndash; like music that's much too loud. <strong>Blaring</strong>!!!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>You got teenage kids Rob?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Not yet, no.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>They'll be blaring their music soon enough. OK, and Oliver also mentioned machines <strong>bleeping</strong> and <strong>buzzing.</strong> Now a <strong>bleep</strong>&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong><strong>Bleep bleep.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's one &nbsp;<strong>b &ndash; l &ndash; double e &ndash; p</strong> - is a short, high sound, which electronic devices make. Something like this: <strong>Bleep, bleep, bleep.</strong> That sounds like a heart monitor.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Very good.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And a <strong>buzz -</strong> that's <strong>b &ndash; u &ndash; z &ndash; z</strong> - is a low, continuing sound, like machines and insects make.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes. Buzzzzzzzzzzz&hellip;.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's it Rob.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Like that, yes?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well done. Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Is there a bee in here? Now, the sounds of the city don't stop, even at night. Here's Oliver.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br/></strong>&hellip; you can still hear the fridge <strong>humming</strong>, and the <strong>rumble</strong> of the traffic outside.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So he can hear the fridge <strong>humming</strong>. The word <strong>hum &ndash; h &ndash; u &ndash; m - </strong>describes a low, continuous sound. And a <strong>hum</strong> [HUMMMMMMMM] is different from a <strong>buzz</strong> [BUZZZZZZZZ]! Can we listen to your hum and your buzz, Rob?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK, why not? Here we go. [HUMMM] and [BUZZZ].</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Is that your fridge and your bee?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>That's right, yes, in that order.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Oliver also spoke about the <strong>rumble</strong> of the traffic out in the street. Now, a <strong>rumble &ndash; r &ndash; u &ndash; m &ndash; b &ndash; l &ndash; e -</strong> is a bit like a <strong>buzz</strong>, but there's a difference &ndash; a <strong>buzz</strong> [BUZZZZZZZZZ] continues without changing, but a <strong>rumble</strong> goes up and down, like the wheels of a truck on rough ground going <strong>rumble, rumble, rumble, rumble, rumble.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong><strong>Rumble</strong>. You carry on<strong> rumbling.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Finally, Oliver spoke about the sound of the wind in the trees. Listen out for the word he used.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 3<br/></strong>Then I wish I was far away from the city, sleeping in a tent, with no sound except the <strong>rustle</strong> of the wind in the trees.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong><strong>Rustle</strong> describes the sound of the wind, A <strong>rustle</strong> is a soft, dry, moving sound. It's spelt <strong>r &ndash; u &ndash; s &ndash; t &ndash; l &ndash; e</strong>. And in pronunciation, the<strong> t</strong> is silent, so it's <strong>rustle</strong>. Rustle, rustle, rustle&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Quite a nice sound really.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT<br/></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And our subject today is onomatopoeia &ndash; words that sound like the thing they describe. &nbsp;And it's time for a quiz! Question one. Rob, what sound does a car horn make?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Easy, it's a <strong>honk</strong>! Question two: what sound does a fridge make?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And it's <strong>hum</strong>. And the last question: what sound does the wind make in the trees?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>The correct answer is <strong>rustle</strong>. And that's the end of today's quiz. Well done to you at home if you got them all right.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And before we go, here's an idea to help you remember new vocabulary: choose one of your favourite songs in your first language, and write some new words for it, in English.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, and then, practise singing your song! It will help you to remember the new words.</p>

<p><strong>Both<br/></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Neil...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>And I'm Catherine. In this programme we're looking at multi-word verbs like <strong>move in, move on, move out </strong>and<strong> get on</strong>, and we call these <strong>phrasal verbs</strong>. And prepositions like <strong>in,</strong> <strong>on,</strong> or <strong>out</strong> can completely change the meaning of phrasal verbs...</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>...so we'll be looking at these verbs in sentences to help us understand their meanings.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>Let's start by listening to Robin. He&rsquo;s having problems with his housemate, Pete. And here's a question for you while you listen. Why is Robin unhappy with Pete?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/>Robin<br/></strong>Pete <strong>moved in</strong> three months ago. We <strong>got on</strong> well at first &ndash; we were friends &ndash; but now it's terrible. He's so messy! And he keeps disturbing me when I'm trying to <strong>get on with</strong> my college work. It's really time for us to <strong>move on</strong> &ndash; we can't be friends anymore. I'm going to ask him to <strong>move out</strong> and live somewhere else, but he <strong>gets on with</strong> my family &ndash; my brother really likes him &ndash; so it'll be difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK. So we asked you: why is Robin unhappy with Pete?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>It's because Pete is messy and keeps disturbing him. What do you think of that, Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I'm not surprised then. They were friends at first. Here's what Robin said:</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></strong>We <strong>got on</strong> well at first &ndash; we were friends...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>Right. So, here, <strong>get on</strong> means <strong>have a good relationship</strong>. And we can work out the meaning of <strong>get on</strong> by listening to what Robin said next. He said: <strong>we were friends</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>What about Pete's relationship with Robin&rsquo;s family?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br/></strong>...he <strong>gets on with</strong> my family &ndash; my brother really likes him...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So Pete and Robin's family have a good relationship. And to add an object to the verb get on, we use the preposition <strong>with</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's right. We can say: Pete and Robin's family <strong>get on</strong>. And we can also say: Pete <strong>gets on with</strong> Robin's family.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We can. Now listen to <strong>get on</strong> in this clip.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 3 <br/></strong>...and he keeps disturbing me when I'm trying to <strong>get on with</strong> my college work.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong> <br/>This time,<strong> get on with</strong> isn't about a relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong> <br/>No, it isn't. In this one, <strong>get on with</strong> means <strong>do</strong>, or <strong>continue doing</strong>, something.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But Robin can't <strong>get on with it</strong> because Pete keeps disturbing him. Pete stops Robin finishing his work. And to understand what <strong>get on with</strong> means in each of these contexts, we have to pay attention to the words around each verb phrase.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We do. So, <strong>get on with</strong> usually means <strong>have a good relationship</strong> when the sentence around it is talking about people.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/><strong>Get on with</strong> is usually about finishing something if we're talking about work, studies or a project.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary, from BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And we're talking about <strong>phrasal verbs</strong>. We've looked at <strong>get on </strong>and<strong> get on with</strong> to talk about relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>My brother and sister don't <strong>get on</strong>, but I <strong>get on with</strong> both of them.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh, lucky you.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I know.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And <strong>get on with</strong> when we're talking about work.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I'm <strong>getting on with</strong> my work, Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Good! And we work out which meaning is which by listening to the context. Let&rsquo;s <strong>get on with</strong> the programme and take a look at some phrasal verbs with <strong>move</strong>. Here&rsquo;s a clip.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 3<br/></strong>Pete <strong>moved in</strong> three months ago ... It's really time for us to <strong>move on</strong> ... I'm going to ask him to <strong>move out</strong> and live somewhere else ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So we had <strong>move in</strong>, <strong>move on</strong> and <strong>move out</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/>Move in </strong>means<strong> start to live in a place</strong>. If you want to say <strong>who</strong> you're starting to live with, use <strong>with</strong>, like this:</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>Pete <strong>moved in with</strong> Robin six months ago.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>To say <strong>the place</strong> that someone started living, use <strong>into</strong> instead of <strong>in</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>Pete <strong>moved into</strong> Robin&rsquo;s house six months ago.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>Now,<strong> move out</strong> is the opposite. It's when you stop living somewhere and go to live somewhere new. So it describes a change.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>It does. And <strong>move on</strong> also describes a change, but not just about housing: <strong>move on</strong> has a sense of progressing to something different. So, Robin is going to end his friendship with Pete, Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Well that&rsquo;s certainly a change. And now we must <strong>move on </strong>too: It's quiz time! Number one. I'm <strong>getting on with</strong> my school project. Is getting on with here about a) a relationship or b) finishing something?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And it's b). It's about <strong>finishing something </strong>&ndash; a school project. Number two. I'm not very happy with my job. I'll have to a) move in, b) move out, or c) move on.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And it's c) <strong>move on</strong>. It's about changing to something new. Last one. I've just found a new flat. I'm a) moving in or b) moving on next week.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>And it's a) <strong>moving in</strong>. That's what we say about starting to live somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And that's the end of the quiz.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>But before we go, here's that top tip for learning vocabulary. When you see or hear a phrasal verb, pay close attention to all the words in the sentence. Write the sentence down if you can. That will help you learn and remember the meaning.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's a good tip. There&rsquo;s more about this at <a href=""http://www.bbclearningenglish.com"">bbclearningenglish.com</a>. Join us again soon for more 6 Minute Vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Both<br/></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Catherine...</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And I'm Neil. Oh... Catherine.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A present?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>How kind. It's not even my birthday.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I know, Neil. But every day's a present day in Learning English. Actually, I bought it because the word present is a key word for the topic we're going to present in this programme...</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Ah... PREsent and preSENT. They are spelt same way but we say them differently.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right, because today we&rsquo;re talking about words that are spelt the same, but pronounced differently, depending on whether we&rsquo;re using them as nouns or verbs.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Like PREsent and preSENT. So the present you gave me is the noun.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That&rsquo;s right. And we&rsquo;re presenting 6 Minute Vocabulary &ndash; present here is a verb.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We&rsquo;ll be giving you more examples&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>And we&rsquo;ll have a quiz, so listen carefully &hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And we&rsquo;ll also bring you a top tip for learning vocabulary. And I&rsquo;ve got an invite for Catherine to my party&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And it&rsquo;s not even your birthday.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It&rsquo;s my birthday every day.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK. I&rsquo;ll come to your party then.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, more about that invite later&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>But first, let&rsquo;s hear Lucy talking about Sam Smith, her favourite singer. Neil: Sam Smith. Are you a fan?</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>I wouldn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m a fan, but I&rsquo;m aware of his work.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Oh good.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Anyway, here&rsquo;s Lucy. And she is a big Sam Smith fan. Think about this question while you listen: Will the number of people who want to go to his concerts go up, or down?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Lucy<br/></strong>I really want to go to a Sam Smith concert but the tickets have already sold out. Sometimes when that happens, they increase the number of concert dates. I want to hear him sing 'Stay with me' &ndash; it won 'Record of the Year' at the Grammys. I hope he&rsquo;ll record some new songs soon. But that will mean an increase in people wanting concert tickets.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>So we asked you: Will the number of people who want to go to Sam Smith concerts go up, or will it go down?</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And the answer is: it will go up. Lucy says there will be an increase in people wanting concert tickets.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, and increase here is a noun, so the stress is on the first syllable: INcrease. But Lucy also used the same word as a verb. Listen to this clip. Where does the stress fall this time?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br/></strong>Sometimes when that happens, they increase the number of concert dates.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>This time, the stress falls on the second syllable &ndash; inCREASE, because Lucy&rsquo;s using the word as a verb.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Other nouns and verbs with the same spelling move the stress from the first to second syllable in the same way - like the noun DEcrease&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>&hellip;which becomes deCREASE, when it&rsquo;s a verb.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>&hellip;and there is, of course Neil, the INvite you gave me to your party&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, INvite here is a noun with the stress on the first syllable. But if I say to Catherine, I want to inVITE you to my party on Saturday, inVITE is a verb, with the stress falling on the second syllable&hellip; Don&rsquo;t worry Catherine &ndash; I haven&rsquo;t forgotten&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Nor have I, Neil! Looking forward to it. And here&rsquo;s another clip from Lucy. Listen out for another word she uses as a noun and a verb with different stress patterns.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 1</strong></p>
<p>I want to hear him sing 'Stay with me' &ndash; it won &lsquo;REcord of the Year&rsquo; at the Grammys. I hope he&rsquo;ll reCORD some new songs soon.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We had REcord and reCORD. REcord is the noun, so the stress is on the first syllable.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>&hellip;And reCORD is the verb, so the stress is on the second syllable.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT</strong><br/>6 Minute Vocabulary, from BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>We&rsquo;re talking about nouns and verbs that are spelt the same but pronounced differently, like a REcord and to reCORD.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And we stress the first syllable when the word is a noun, and the second syllable when the word is a verb.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And now, it&rsquo;s time for a quiz, so get ready! Which is the correct way to say the missing word in these sentences? Number one: Michael Phelps has the [sfx: bell] for the most Olympic gold medals. Is it a) reCORD or b) REcord?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>It&rsquo;s REcord because it&rsquo;s a noun.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Well done if you got that right. Number two: We hope that sales will [sfx: bell] this month. Is it a) INcrease or b) InCREASE?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>And the answer is b) InCREASE because it&rsquo;s a verb.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And finally, number three: I need to buy a [sfx: bell] for my friends. They&rsquo;re getting married tomorrow. Is it a) PREsent or b) preSENT?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It&rsquo;s a) PREsent because it&rsquo;s a noun.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And that&rsquo;s the end of the quiz &ndash; well done if you got them right.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>And it&rsquo;s almost the end of the programme.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>But before we go, here&rsquo;s today&rsquo;s top tip for learning vocabulary: when you look up a word in an online dictionary, listen to the audio and try to copy the word stress. If possible, record yourself saying the word, then compare your pronunciation with the audio from the dictionary.</p>

<p><strong>Both</strong><br/>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I&rsquo;m Catherine&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And I&rsquo;m Neil. You know, Catherine, 6 Minute Vocabulary is great because you can listen to each programme again and again&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>You can, Neil. You can <strong>reuse</strong> them&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>You can! And the word <strong>reuse</strong> is a clue to today&rsquo;s topic&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>It is, we&rsquo;re talking about prefixes &ndash; those are the two or three letters we can add to the beginning of words to change their meaning &hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>&hellip;like <strong>re-</strong>, in <strong>reuse</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>We&rsquo;ll tell you more about <strong>re-</strong> later and we&rsquo;ll also tell you aboutthe prefixes <strong>pre-</strong> and <strong>pro-</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>We&rsquo;ll explain what all three prefixes mean and give you lots of examples.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>There&rsquo;ll be a quiz at the end &hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>&hellip; and a top tip for learning vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>But first, let&rsquo;s hear from Katie. She&rsquo;s an environmental campaigner. While you listen, try to answer this question: What do teachers do with cereal boxes? Here&rsquo;s Katie.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Katie</strong><br/>Most food in supermarkets nowadays is <strong>prepacked</strong> in plastic and cardboard. This creates so much waste. Takeaways and <strong>precooked</strong> meals also use a lot of packaging. We have to <strong>re-educate</strong> people to cook for themselves so they don&rsquo;t just <strong>reheat</strong> meals &hellip; and people really need to become more <strong>proactive</strong> in <strong>recycling</strong> materials. Teachers in <strong>preschool</strong> are great at this &ndash; they <strong>reuse</strong> cereal boxes to make fantastic models of robots and spaceships with the kids.</p>
<p><strong>STING</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>So we asked you: What do teachers do with cereal boxes?</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And the answer is: They <strong>reuse</strong> them to make models of robots and spaceships.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>That&rsquo;s right. They make something new with the boxes. But instead of saying &lsquo;they use the boxes again&rsquo;, Katie said the word <strong>reuse</strong>. Now, the prefix <strong>re</strong>-, spelt <strong>r-e</strong>, in front of a word means <strong>again.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>So <strong>re</strong>- plus <strong>use</strong> means use again. We also had <strong>re</strong>- plus <strong>cycling</strong>, which also means <strong>to use again</strong>. Listen out for more words with <strong>re</strong>- in this clip.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br/></strong>We have to <strong>re-educate</strong> people to cook for themselves so they don&rsquo;t just <strong>reheat</strong> meals.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>Katie used the word <strong>re-educate</strong>. That&rsquo;s <strong>re</strong>-, which means <strong>again,</strong> plus <strong>educate</strong>, so <strong>re-educate</strong> means <strong>educate again.</strong> And in this case,<strong> re-educate</strong> means <strong>teach people to behave in a different way</strong> so they start to cook for themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Another other word with <strong>re</strong>- was <strong>reheat</strong>. That&rsquo;s <strong>re</strong>- plus <strong>heat</strong>, making <strong>reheat</strong>, which means <strong>heat again</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>Let&rsquo;s have another clip. See if you can spot a different prefix.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 2</strong></p>
<p>Most food in supermarkets nowadays is <strong>prepacked</strong> in plastic and cardboard. Takeaways and <strong>precooked</strong> meals also use a lot of packaging.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>We heard <strong>prepacked</strong> and <strong>precooked</strong>. Both start with <strong>pre</strong>-, spelt <strong>p-r-e</strong>, which means <strong>before</strong> or <strong>already.</strong> So a lot of the food in supermarkets is already packed in cardboard and plastic &ndash; it&rsquo;s <strong>prepacked</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And you can buy meals that have been made and cooked before you buy them. <strong>Pre</strong>- plus <strong>cooked</strong> means <strong>already cooked</strong>&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>And the children Katie talked about were in <strong>preschool</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>That&rsquo;s <strong>pre</strong>- plus <strong>school</strong>, that&rsquo;s <strong>preschool</strong>. It&rsquo;s a place children go before they go to proper school.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>So that&rsquo;s <strong>re</strong>- and <strong>pre</strong>-. Now let&rsquo;s talk about <strong>pro</strong>-, spelt <strong>p-r-o</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Katie said people need to be more <strong>proactive</strong> in recycling. <strong>Pro</strong>- means <strong>in support of</strong> or <strong>in favour of</strong> something.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>So being <strong>proactive</strong>: <strong>pro</strong>- plus <strong>active</strong> - in <strong>recycling</strong> means making more effort to recycle things. Neil, are you a proactive recycler?</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Yeah. Well, we&rsquo;ve got two bins. One for recycling and one for all the food. So, I suppose I am.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>Very good.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Now, another word with the prefix <strong>pro</strong>- that is used a lot when talking about food is <strong>probiotic</strong>. <strong>Probiotics</strong> are good bacteria that help to keep you healthy.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT</strong><br/>You&rsquo;re listening to BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And we&rsquo;re talking about the prefixes <strong>re</strong>-, <strong>pre</strong>- and <strong>pro</strong>-.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>And now for a quiz. Number one: Which prefix goes before the word school to make the word for a place for very young children. Is it a) <strong>re</strong>- b) <strong>pre</strong>- or c) <strong>pro</strong>-?</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And the answer is b) <strong>pre:</strong> it&rsquo;s <strong>preschool</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>Good. Number two: What would you do with a ready-made meal? Would you a) <strong>preheat</strong> it b) <strong>reheat</strong> it or c) <strong>proheat</strong> it?</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And the answer is b) <strong>re:</strong> that&rsquo;s <strong>reheat</strong> it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>Great. And, number three: If you want to improve your English, should you be a) <strong>reactive</strong>, b) <strong>preactive</strong> or c) <strong>proactive</strong> when you&rsquo;re learning new words?</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And the answer is c)it&rsquo;s <strong>pro</strong>: that&rsquo;s <strong>proactive</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/>And that&rsquo;s the end of the quiz &ndash; well done if you got them right.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And now, here&rsquo;s today&rsquo;s top tip for learning vocabulary: try to group new words by their prefixes. This will help you to remember their meaning.</p>

<p><strong>Both</strong><br/>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I&rsquo;m Catherine&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>And I&rsquo;m Rob. In today&rsquo;s show we&rsquo;re going to look at a very important part of spoken and written vocabulary: silent letters.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br/>Silent letters. We&rsquo;ll look at what they are, where they appear and how to say them&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>There&rsquo;ll be a quiz&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br/>And we&rsquo;ll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Rob &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/></strong>But first, let&rsquo;s listen to Nick. He&rsquo;s at the doctor&rsquo;s, and it&rsquo;s not good news.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/></strong>No, it&rsquo;s not. While you listen, try and answer this question: what treatment does the<br/>doctor suggest for Nick?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Doctor<br/></strong>Take a seat. What seems to be the problem?</p>
<p><strong>Nick<br/></strong>It&rsquo;s my wrist &ndash; it really hurts!</p>
<p><strong>Doctor<br/></strong>Let&rsquo;s see if we can work out what&rsquo;s wrong. Do you have pain anywhere else? What about your elbows and knees?</p>
<p><strong>Nick<br/></strong>No. They&rsquo;re fine. But I can&rsquo;t move my thumb and I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br/>Well. Have you done anything physically demanding recently?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br/>I did play tennis yesterday&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br/>You&rsquo;ve probably just got a pulled muscle then. You&rsquo;ll just have to rest your wrist. No playing tennis for a while I'm afraid.</p>
<p><strong>STING</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So, we asked you: what treatment did the doctor suggest for Nick?</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>And the answer is: he told Nick to rest his wrist.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br/>He did: well done if you got that right. Now, <strong>wrist</strong> &ndash; that&rsquo;s the bit of your body that joins your arm to your hand &ndash; is an example of the vocabulary area we&rsquo;re looking at today &ndash; and that&rsquo;s words with silent letters, Rob.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>Yes: we spell this word <strong>wrist</strong>, <strong>w-r-i-s-t</strong>, but when we say it, we don&rsquo;t pronounce the first letter <strong>/w/.</strong> Instead, we start with the sound from the second letter in the word, which is the letter <strong>r</strong> - pronounced <strong>/r/.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br/>Let&rsquo;s listen to Nick again.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nick &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/></strong>It&rsquo;s my wrist &ndash; it really hurts!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br/>So we don&rsquo;t say <strong>w-rist</strong>: we say <strong>wrist</strong>. <strong>Wrist</strong>. Some other words that start with a silent&nbsp;<strong>w</strong> are&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>Write: that&rsquo;s <strong>w-r-i-t-e</strong>, like to write a letter, and wrong, <strong>w-r-o-n-g</strong>, meaning not correct. In fact, there&rsquo;s a rule here, which is: we don&rsquo;t usually pronounce the <strong>w</strong> in words that begin <strong>w-r</strong>. When did you last write a letter, Catherine?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br/>I wrote a letter on paper&hellip; I really don&rsquo;t know Rob, to be honest, it&rsquo;s all email for me now.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>That&rsquo;s a good idea, with your handwriting.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Probably. Now, Nick said another word with a silent letter:</p>
<p><strong>INSERT &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nick<br/></strong>&hellip; but I can&rsquo;t move my thumb and I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>The word was<strong> know</strong>, meaning: to recognise and understand something, is spelt <strong>k-n-o-w</strong> but we don&rsquo;t say the letter <strong>k</strong>. So it isn&rsquo;t <strong>k-now</strong> but <strong>know</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/></strong>It&rsquo;s <strong>know</strong>. So, another rule for you: we don&rsquo;t normally say the <strong>k</strong> in words that begin&nbsp;<strong>k-n</strong>: like <strong>knee</strong>, the joint between your upper and lower leg, and <strong>knife</strong>, the tool we use to cut things. <strong>Knee</strong> and <strong>knife</strong> start with silent <strong>k</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>Excellent. Now, Nick also said a word with a silent letter at the end.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br/>He did, it&rsquo;s a part of the hand: you&rsquo;ve got four fingers, and then the fifth one that sticks out the other way is your <strong>thumb</strong>; that&rsquo;s<strong> thumb</strong> spelt <strong>&shy;t-h-u-m-b</strong>, but we don&rsquo;t pronounce the final <strong>b</strong>. We don&rsquo;t say <strong>thum-b</strong> &ndash; we say <strong>thumb</strong>. <strong>Thumb</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>Some other words with a silent <strong>b</strong> at the end are&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><strong>Climb</strong>, like to climb a ladder, and <strong>lamb</strong>, a baby sheep.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Do you like lamb, Catherine?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br/>I do like lamb! I like lambs when they are alive, I have to say, I also quite like eating them.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br/>And it&rsquo;s time for a quiz. Count the silent letters in these sentences. Number one. There&rsquo;s&nbsp; something <strong>wrong</strong> with my <strong>wrist</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>And the answer is two. <strong>Wrong</strong> and <strong>wrist</strong> both begin with a silent <strong>w</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br/>Good. Sentence number two. I don&rsquo;t <strong>know</strong> why my <strong>thumb</strong> hurts.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>And the answer is two again. <strong>Know</strong> starts with a silent <strong>k</strong> and <strong>thumb</strong> ends with a silent <strong>b.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br/>And the last one. No, I can&rsquo;t <strong>climb</strong> up there because I&rsquo;ve hurt my <strong>knee</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/></strong>Well, <strong>climb </strong>has a silent <strong>b</strong> at the end, and <strong>knee</strong> starts with a silent <strong>k</strong>. But the word&nbsp;<strong>no</strong> at the beginning of the sentence is the opposite of yes, so it&rsquo;s spelt <strong>n-o</strong>. So the answer is: there are two words with silent letters in this sentence.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br/>Well done if you got those right.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>And that brings us almost to the end of today&rsquo;s programme.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br/>Before we go, here&rsquo;s today&rsquo;s top tip for learning and recording vocabulary: when you learn a word, and you know it has a silent letter, mark the silent letter very clearly in your vocabulary notebook. That way you won&rsquo;t forget how to say it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Thank you &ndash; I know what to do now! There&rsquo;s more about this at BBC Learning English dot com. Join us again for more 6 Minute Vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Both<br/></strong>Bye!</p>
<p>Did you hear - or rather not hear the silent letters in some of the words? The ones that were used were:</p>

"<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Hello! And welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me, Catherine&hellip;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>&hellip;and me Finn. In this programme, we&rsquo;re looking at spelling. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And the area of spelling we&rsquo;re looking at today is words with double letters.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Let&rsquo;s start by listening to David. He&rsquo;s a student welfare officer at a university. He&rsquo;s welcoming a new student to the campus.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And while you listen to David, here&rsquo;s a question for you.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>What word means: the rooms, flats and houses that people live in? Here&rsquo;s David.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>David<br/></strong></span><span>Congratulations on <strong>getting </strong>a place at our university. It&rsquo;s a <strong>brilliant opportunity </strong>and I&rsquo;m sure that you will&nbsp;be<strong> happy </strong>and <strong>successful </strong>here. I&rsquo;m here to help you find <strong>accommodation</strong>. We&rsquo;ve got rooms, flats and houses all over the city, but I <strong>recommend </strong>that you <strong>apply</strong> as soon as<strong> possible</strong> so you&rsquo;re not <strong>disappointed</strong>. Here&rsquo;s a list of <strong>addresses</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>STING</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>David there. And we asked: what&rsquo;s the word for rooms, flats and houses that people live in?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And the answer is: <strong>accommodation</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>It is and <strong>accommodation </strong>is one of our words with double letters. So, Finn&nbsp;do you spell accommodation?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span><strong>a-double c-o-double m-o-d-a-t-i-o-n</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Well done, Finn. Now listen to this clip. Which&nbsp;6 words have double letters? </span></p>
<p><span><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/></strong>Congratulations on <strong>getting </strong>a place at our University. It&rsquo;s a <strong>brilliant opportunity </strong>and I&rsquo;m sure that you will be<strong> happy </strong>and <strong>successful </strong>here!&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So we had <strong>getting &ndash; </strong>with <strong>double t</strong>,<strong> brilliant </strong>with<strong> double l, opportunity </strong>with <strong>double p</strong>,<strong> will </strong>with<strong> double l</strong>, and also<strong>&nbsp;happy </strong>with <strong>double p</strong> and <strong>successful &ndash; </strong>with <strong>double c</strong> and <strong>double s</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Correct! Let's take a look at some spelling rules. The first rule is about verbs. If the final three letters of a verb are consonant, vowel, consonant, we double the final consonant before we add <strong>i-n-g</strong> or <strong>e-d</strong>. So&nbsp;<strong>get, </strong>spelt <strong>g-e-t&nbsp;</strong>becomes <strong>getting</strong> with double t, and <strong>begin</strong> ends in <strong>g-i-n</strong> so it becomes <strong>beginning </strong>with <strong>double n</strong>. Now o</span><span>ur next rule is to do with short vowel sounds. Finn can you demonstrate some short vowel sounds please?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>a, o, i, e, a, u...</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Fantastic. That's enough, thank you. And now some long vowel sounds?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>u, e, a, ei...</p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong></span><span>Ok, so, when there is a <strong>short</strong> vowel sound before a consonant, like <strong>a</strong> in <strong>happy, </strong>we often double the consonant after it. The <strong>short a</strong> in <strong>happy</strong> gives us a <strong>double p</strong>. The short <strong>o </strong>in<strong> opportunity</strong> gives us another<strong> double p, </strong>the short<strong> i </strong>in<strong> brilliant </strong>gives us <strong>double l.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>And this can happen more than once in the same word. So in the word<strong> successful</strong>, we get <strong>u</strong> <strong>double</strong> <strong>c</strong> and <strong>e double s</strong>, and in <strong>accommodation</strong> we get <strong>a double c</strong> and <strong>o double m. </strong>Easy!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Exactly. And lots of short words like <strong>summer, coffee </strong>and<strong> apple</strong> and <strong>will</strong> follow this general rule.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So let&rsquo;s listen to another clip and put this general rule to the test. Listen carefully&hellip;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br/></strong></span><span>But I <strong>recommend </strong>that you apply as soon as<strong> possible</strong> so you&rsquo;re not <strong>disappointed</strong>. Here&rsquo;s a list of <strong>addresses</strong> &hellip;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>So: following the rule, we&rsquo;ve got <strong>recommend</strong> with <strong>o double m</strong>, <strong>possible</strong> with <strong>o double s</strong> and <strong>disappointed</strong> with <strong>a double p</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And we&rsquo;re talking about words with double letters.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Right, quiz time! Number one: Is there a double <strong>n </strong>in the verb <strong>happening</strong>?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>No, there isn&rsquo;t. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Well done! Number two: Are there any double letters in the word <strong>immediately</strong>?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span>Yes, there&rsquo;s a <strong>double</strong> <strong>m</strong>. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Very good! Number three: Which of these words have a <strong>double c</strong>? <strong>occasion, accident, succeed</strong>?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And the answer is &ndash; they all do! They all have a short vowel sound followed by a&nbsp;<strong>double c</strong>. That's a Finn trick question.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>It was indeed. And that&rsquo;s the end of the quiz. You&rsquo;re <strong>brilliant</strong> with <strong>double l</strong> if you got all of those questions right!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And now here&rsquo;s a top tip for vocabulary learning. If you&rsquo;re struggling to learn the spelling of a word, get a keyboard and type it a hundred times. Your fingers might learn the spelling more quickly than your brain!

"<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Hello! I'm Catherine, and this is Rob.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, hello! And welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. Today we're talking about adjectives that end in <strong>i-c,</strong> pronounced <strong>ic,</strong> and adjectives that end in <strong>i-c-a-l</strong>, pronounced <strong>ical</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>First, let's listen to Hannah. She's talking about her favourite books.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Our question today is: why does Hannah get most of her books from the library? Listen carefully and find out!</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Hannah<br/></strong>I'm always reading! I like <strong>classic</strong> English novels, by writers like Jane Austen or Charles Dickens. I also like non-fiction; especially books about interesting <strong>historical</strong> characters. I love buying books, but it's so expensive! Mostly, I borrow books from the library. It's much more <strong>economical</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>STING</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So, why does Hannah prefer to get her books from the library? Because it's more <strong>economical.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hannah mentioned that she likes to read novels. Do you remember what type of novels she likes to read? Listen once again:</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1<br/></strong>I like <strong>classic</strong> English novels, by writers like Jane Austen or Charles Dickens.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Hannah said she likes to read <strong>classic</strong> novels. The word <strong>classic </strong>ends in <strong>i-c</strong>. It's an adjective that describes something that's a particularly good example of a category &ndash; or a particularly famous example.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So, novels by Jane Austen and Charles Dickens are <strong>classic</strong>, because they're particularly good, and very famous, examples of novels. And they've been popular for a long time, so we could say they've stood the test of time.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Exactly, a bit like you Rob.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>You're welcome. But be careful because people often confuse <strong>classic</strong> with another adjective: <strong>classical</strong>. Now<strong> classical</strong>, ending in <strong>i-c-a-l</strong> has a slightly different meaning &ndash; it describes a formal and often quite old style of art in forms such as painting, theatre, architecture and so on. Rob, do you like <strong>classical</strong> music?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Oh. Occasionally, but I do find it a bit heavy going.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>A bit much is it?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Sometimes, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>You're more of a Beyonc&eacute; man?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, that's me.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK, so let's listen again to another clip:</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br/></strong>I also like non-fiction; especially books about interesting <strong>historical</strong> characters.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Historical </strong>is another <strong>i-c-a-l</strong> adjective &ndash; and it means 'connected to stories about the past'. So Rob &ndash; name me a <strong>historical</strong> character that you particularly identify with.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>That's a hard one, but I'd say Captain Cook. He liked to travel and he went round the world discovering new places, which is something I like to do.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>You do, don't you.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So I can identify with him, yes. Moving on&hellip; now the <strong>i-c</strong> adjective - <strong>historic </strong>- has a slightly different meaning: it describes something important, or something that will people will remember for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So, if something really important and amazing happens today, we'll say <strong>today is a historic day</strong>. Like the day Newcastle United wins the European cup Rob!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK, in your dreams I think.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well maybe, but if it ever happened it would be a <strong>historic</strong> day. Now a quick pronunciation tip for you: we pronounce<strong> historic</strong> and <strong>historical</strong> with the stress on the same syllable in both words,the<strong> 'to'</strong>. And it's the same with<strong> classic</strong> and <strong>classical</strong>: in both words, the stress is on the same syllable, this time, <strong>'cla'.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So:<strong> Historic, historical. Classic, classical.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Now listen again to one more clip:</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 3<br/></strong>Mostly, I borrow books from the library. It's much more <strong>economical</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So, we use the adjective<strong> economical</strong> &ndash; or as some people say, <strong>economical</strong> &ndash; with <strong>i-c-a-l</strong> when something is cheap, or good value for money.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>But the adjective <strong>economic</strong> with <strong>i-c</strong> has a different meaning: <strong>economic</strong> means 'connected to the subject of money and finance'.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So, we might say, <strong>the bus is more economical than the train</strong>, and we would say, <strong>the country has economic problems</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT<br/></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English dot com</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And we're talking about adjectives that end in &ndash;<strong>ic</strong> and &ndash;<strong>ical</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Like <strong>economic</strong> and <strong>economical</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And now it's time for a little quiz! Listen to this, then answer question one.</p>
<p><strong>[sfx: music]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Question one: was that an example of <strong>classic</strong> music, or was it <strong>classical</strong> music?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It was <strong>classical </strong>music. Not too much for you Rob?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>No, it's enough, just enough.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Okay, question two: if you watch a film about the past, is it a <strong>historic</strong> film or a <strong>historical</strong> film?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>It's a <strong>historical</strong> film. Last question! If you read the news about business and the financial markets, are you reading the <strong>economic</strong> news or the <strong>economical </strong>news?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And that's the <strong>economic </strong>news. And that's the end of the quiz. Well done!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, well done. Finally, here's a piece of vocabulary learning advice. Learning vocabulary alone is okay, but it's often more effective to work together with a study partner. Find someone who is learning English, get together regularly, and give each other vocabulary tests!</p>

"<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me, Catherine&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And me, Rob. Hello. In this show we&rsquo;re going to <strong>find out about</strong> multi-word verbs.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/></strong>That&rsquo;s right: we&rsquo;re <strong>looking</strong> <strong>into</strong> verb phrases that are <strong>made up of</strong> more than one word. And if you&rsquo;d like an example, Rob and I have used three of them already.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>It&rsquo;s incredible: we have! Catherine you said <strong>looking into</strong> and <strong>made up of</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yep, and Rob you said <strong>find out about</strong>. And some people call this type of multi-word verb a phrasal verb.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>They do. And in this programme, we&rsquo;ll look at lots of multi-word verbs&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>&hellip; we&rsquo;ll explain what they mean &hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>There&rsquo;ll be a quiz &hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And we&rsquo;ll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So, let&rsquo;s get started by listening to Andre &ndash; a student from France who is studying in London.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yep, and he&rsquo;s talking about his weekend. And here are two questions for you while you listen. First, did Andre meet up with his friends?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And second, Andre&rsquo;s English is pretty good, but it sounds a bit unnatural. Why is that? Here&rsquo;s Andre.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Andre<br/></strong>I wanted to <strong>rendezvous</strong> with friends at the shopping centre, but I couldn&rsquo;t find them. In the end, I <strong>abandoned</strong> the day. They said they couldn&rsquo;t find me, but I think they just <strong>invented</strong> a story!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Thank you, Andre. And we asked you if Andre managed to meet his friends.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And sadly he didn&rsquo;t. He said he abandoned the day. Well done if you got that at home. But why did Andre&rsquo;s English sound unnatural?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well, we could understand him OK, but some of the words he used were a little bit too formal for everyday natural spoken English.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, thats right. When we&rsquo;re speaking, some words, especially verbs that originally come from Latin &ndash; make us sound much too formal. Andre used quite a few of these &ndash; for example he said <strong>abandon</strong> the day.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yeah - abandon the day. Well, to sound more natural, Andre could use a multi-word verb instead, and say he<strong> gave up on </strong>the day. Now, <strong>give up on something</strong> has a very similar meaning to <strong>abandon</strong> in Andre&rsquo;s sentence &ndash; they both mean <strong>stop doing something, because you&rsquo;re not succeeding</strong>. And Andre stopped hoping he would find his friends. Poor Andre.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So,<strong> give up on</strong> is a phrasal verb. In English, these are made up of verbs and prepositions.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yep, so, we&rsquo;ve got the verb <strong>give</strong> and the prepositions <strong>up</strong> and <strong>on</strong>. And Andre needs to use more of these phrasal verbs when he&rsquo;s speaking.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>So, are we saying that these Latinate verbs are wrong? Or not as good as the multi-word verbs? Can we forget about learning Latinate verbs then?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well, that would be good, Rob. But, actually no, you do need to learn them and they&rsquo;re not wrong: it&rsquo;s just a question of context. You&rsquo;ll see a lot more of the Latinate verbs in written English and in formal English, so yep,&nbsp;you do&nbsp;need to learn both types, and use the right one in the right situation. So, for example, Andre said he said he planned to <strong>rendezvous</strong> with friends. Now, if he changes the Latin <strong>rendezvous</strong> to <strong>meet up with</strong>, the meaning doesn&rsquo;t really change, it just makes his speaking sound more natural.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK, well, let&rsquo;s listen to one more example.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Andre<br/></strong>I think they just invented a story!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>This would&nbsp;sound better as <strong>I think they just</strong> <strong>made up a story</strong>. When you <strong>make something up</strong>, you say something that isn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And now, let&rsquo;s listen to Andre again, this time with the multi-word verbs&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/> Andre<br/> </strong>I wanted to <strong>meet up with</strong> friends at the shopping centre, but I couldn&rsquo;t find them. In the end, I <strong>gave up on</strong> the day. They said they couldn&rsquo;t find me, but I think they just <strong>made up</strong> a story!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well done Andre. That&rsquo;s a lot better.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And now it&rsquo;s quiz time! What goes in this gap? I&rsquo;m going to ______ my family next weekend. Is it a) meet on with b) meet up to or c) meet up with?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>The verb is c) meet up with. Number 2. My brother isn&rsquo;t very reliable. He&rsquo;s always a) making on excuses b) making up excuses or c) inventing up excuses.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>He&rsquo;s always&hellip; b) making up excuses. And number 3. What multi-word verb has a similar meaning to the verb <strong>abandon</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the answer is: <strong>give up on</strong>. Well done if you got those right at home.</p>
<p>That brings us almost to the end of today&rsquo;s programme.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>But before we go, here&rsquo;s today&rsquo;s top tip for learning vocabulary: try to learn phrasal verbs and their Latin-based partners in pairs. That way, you&rsquo;ll have the right verb for the right situation. So, we&rsquo;re almost out of time, but Catherine very quickly can you remind us of some of these multi-word verbs we&rsquo;ve heard today?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Most certainly. We had <strong>look into</strong>, <strong>made up of</strong>, <strong>find out about</strong>, <strong>meet up with</strong>, <strong>give up on</strong> and <strong>made up</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Thanks. Very useful. There&rsquo;s more about this at BBC learning English dot com. Join us again for more 6 Minute Vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Both&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Rob <br/> </strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Rob, and this is Catherine.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Hi! Today we've got a <strong>fantastic</strong> programme for you. It's all about <strong>strong adjectives.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, it is. We'll give you a <strong>wonderful</strong> explanation of what they are and how to use them...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We'll also give you some very useful advice on how to use intensifiers with adjectives...</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And there'll be a <strong>fabulous</strong> quiz...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And finally we'll give you an absolutely <strong>amazing</strong> tip to help you learn vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Wow. OK, let's get going then, there's no time to waste. Here's Tom. Now, he took his girlfriend to the cinema and then for dinner afterwards. Very romantic! Let's hear how the evening went. While you're listening, try to answer this question: was it a successful evening out?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Tom<br/></strong>We went to see that new film - I thought it was <strong>quite funny</strong>, but Jenny thought it was <strong>hilarious</strong>. We went for a meal: The food was <strong>not so bad</strong> but the service was <strong>absolutely terrible</strong>! We waited nearly an hour to get our food. When it finally arrived, I was <strong>absolutely starving</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So - the meal didn't go too well: Tom and Jenny had to wait a long time for their food - nearly an hour! What do you think about that Catherine?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I wouldn't last that long. Twenty minutes, and I'd be gone.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, luckily, they liked the film. Listen to this clip:</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1<br/></strong>I thought it was <strong>quite funny</strong>, but Jenny thought it was <strong>hilarious</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Tom said he thought the film was <strong>quite funny</strong>. <strong>Quite funny</strong>. Now, when we use an ordinary adjective, like <strong>funny</strong>, we can add a word like <strong>quite</strong>, or <strong>very</strong>, or <strong>just a little bit</strong>, to give more information about the adjective.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So, we can say the film was <strong>quite funny,</strong> or <strong>very funny</strong>, or <strong>just a little bit funny</strong>. These words are called intensifiers - and they are <strong>quite useful</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>They're <strong>very useful </strong>actually. Yes. So Tom thought the film was funny; but Jenny thought it was <strong>hilarious</strong>. And the word <strong>hilarious</strong> means - very, very funny.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong><strong>Hilarious</strong> is a special kind of adjective - it already includes the idea of <strong>very.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Right, and we call this type of adjective a strong adjective, and there are lots of them. For example, to mean <strong>very good,</strong> we can say:</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong><strong>Wonderful! Fabulous! Amazing!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Thank you Rob. Three <strong>fantastic</strong> words there. But most of the time, we don't use intensifiers like <strong>quite</strong>, or <strong>very</strong>, or <strong>just a little bit with</strong> these strong adjectives, and that's because the idea of <strong>very</strong> is already in the word. So for example, <strong>hilarious</strong> means <strong>very funny</strong>, so <strong>a little bit hilarious</strong> would mean <strong>a little bit very funny</strong>, and that doesn't make sense, does it Rob?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Absolutely not, no. OK, well back to the clip. Tom used a couple of other strong adjectives, too. Listen again. What's the strong adjective?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br/></strong>The food was <strong>not so bad</strong> but the service was <strong>absolutely terrible</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well, Tom used the ordinary adjective <strong>bad</strong>, and he used it with an intensifier when he said <strong>not so bad.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>But the strong adjective was <strong>terrible</strong>. <strong>Terrible </strong>means <strong>very bad</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And this time, Tom used an intensifier that we usually only use with strong adjectives - he said it was <strong>absolutely terrible.</strong> So, when we want to make a strong adjective even stronger, we need to use one of these special intensifiers, like <strong>absolutely</strong>. So, we say <strong>very bad</strong>, but we say <strong>absolutely terrible</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And we don't usually say <strong>absolutely bad</strong>. Here's Tom using another strong adjective. Listen carefully, and see if you can catch it!</p>
<p><strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 3<br/></strong>We waited for nearly an hour to get our food. When it finally arrived, I was <strong>absolutely starving</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Tom used the phrase <strong>absolutely starving</strong>. <strong>Starving</strong> is a strong adjective, which means <strong>very hungry</strong>, and he used the intensifier <strong>absolutely</strong> to make it even stronger. <strong>Absolutely starving</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT<br/></strong>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And today our <strong>absolutely wonderful</strong> topic is strong adjectives and intensifiers.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And now it's time for a very quick quiz. Question one. What is the strong adjective for <strong>funny?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And the answer is <strong>hilarious</strong>. Question two. What is the strong adjective and intensifier for <strong>very bad</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And the answer is <strong>absolutely terrible</strong>. Just one more question! Can you name three strong adjectives that mean <strong>good</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And in the programme today we had <strong>fantastic, wonderful, fabulous </strong>and<strong> amazing</strong>, which describes me I think. And if you got all those right, you're <strong>absolutely wonderful</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And we've just got time for that <strong>fantastic</strong> vocabulary tip we promised you. When you're learning adjectives, make a picture in your mind of someone or something that reminds you of that adjective. It will help you remember the word. For example, I think that Rob is <strong>absolutely fantastic</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>You're just saying that Catherine, thank you very much.</p>
