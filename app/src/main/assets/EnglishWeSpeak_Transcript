"<p><strong>Feifei<br /> </strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak with me Feifei…&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>…and me, Rob. Hello! &nbsp;Hey Feifei, you know that expression 'to wash your dirty linen in public'?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes. The expression 'to wash your dirty linen in public' describes someone who talks about private matters in public – so everyone can hear them. You wouldn't catch me doing that!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br /> Nor me – I always keep private matters private - but anyway it's exactly what Daisy and Tom have been doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> What? They've been washing their dirty linen in public – you mean they've been arguing?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br /> Not exactly – but yesterday, they were out in the garden making lots of noise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Oh I see. Actually Rob I think…&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br /> …and I'm sure Daisy said something about hanging Tom out to dry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Rob, Rob. There's a simple explanation. But let's hear some more examples of this phrase first…&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Tim kept discussing his brother's drinking problem at the pub but I told him not to wash his dirty linen in public.</p> 
<p>I know he's having an affair but do they have to wash their dirty linen in public?</p> 
<p>Don't wash your dirty linen in public, save your argument for when you get home!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So the expression 'to wash your dirty linen in public' means you discuss private matters in public. But Rob, I don't think Daisy and Tom were talking about their family problems in the garden.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well I could hear what was going on.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Are you sure? Because I spoke to Daisy and she said their washing machine had broken down and they were actually washing their clothes outdoors, in the garden. I think the noise was just them having a laugh.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /> </strong>But what about Daisy saying she was going to hang Tom out to dry?<br /><br /><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> I think she meant she was going to hang Tom's <em>clothes</em> out to dry. You need to mind your own business and then you won't hear people washing their dirty linen in public – either literally or metaphorically!<br /><br /><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Thanks for the advice Feifei. Bye.<br /><br /><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Hello and welcome to this beautiful riverside for this edition of The English We Speak. We're going to teach you a new word connected to the internet. I'm Neil and with me is Feifei.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /> </strong>Hi there.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Nothing beats a bit of fishing for relaxation, does it Feifei? Can you pass me the bait?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Bait - that's the stuff you use to attract the fish. Worms are often used. OK Neil, but where is the bait?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Don't say we forgot to bring it. OK, well, let's just have a look on my smartphone for places nearby we can buy some... Oh look at this Feifei - how to earn a million pounds a year working from home.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Don't follow that link Neil - it's just clickbait. It'll be some nonsense.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Clickbait. As we said, 'bait' is something used to attract fish when you are trying to catch them. Clickbait is a link on a website that's trying to attract you - to make you click on it.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> It's a word made up of two words: click and bait. Clickbait. Here are some examples.</p> 
<p><strong>Example<br /></strong>I can never read a long article online. I'm so distracted by the clickbait I always end up on some other site.</p> 
<p>I should have known that article wasn't really going to be about Justin Bieber. They're just using his image as clickbait!</p> 
<p>I used to love social media but now it's just full of adverts and clickbait. Rubbish!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Clickbait. A link on a website designed to draw your attention and make you click!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> It has a quite negative sense. You feel a little like you've been tricked when you click on clickbait.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> That's right. The main aim of the clickbait is to get hits to a site rather than genuinely informing you. Right, now Feifei, how are we going to get some worms to make this fishing trip a success?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Let's have another look at your phone - oh look, 'Celebrity clothing failures...'</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Feifei, that's clickbait. I need bait!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Both</strong><br /> Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Callum<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Callum.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>And I'm Feifei.</p> 
<p><strong>Callum<br /></strong>Feifei, what kind of workers are we – would you describe us as blue-collar workers or white-collar workers?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well, looking at our clothes, you are a T-shirt-no-collar worker and I'm a yellow-with-polka-dot-collar worker. How about that?</p> 
<p><strong>Callum<br /></strong>Come on, Feifei, you know that this has nothing to do with fashion! It's about colours and what they represent when we're talking about the world of work.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I know - just joking. A blue-collar worker is an expression we use to describe someone who does manual work. Someone who works in a factory, for example, who wears a uniform.</p> 
<p><strong>Callum<br /></strong>In the early 20th century, they usually wore clothing which was sturdy, cheap and didn't show dirt easily. Their uniform was made of blue fabric like denim.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>People who worked in offices, doing administration or managerial tasks - clerks for example - were referred to as white-collar workers. It's because of the white shirts they wore.</p> 
<p><strong>Callum<br /></strong>And this way of describing people's jobs has continued – even though people often wear whatever colour collar they like!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>You can also say blue-collar job or white-collar job.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>When the company went bankrupt many white-collar workers found themselves looking for blue-collar jobs.</p> 
<p>Some popular folk songs reflect the aspirations and struggles of blue-collar workers.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well, we have two colours there, but it's good to point out that you might also hear the expression pink-collar worker, which refers to low-paid jobs performed mostly by women - jobs such as a secretary or a nurse.</p> 
<p><strong>Callum<br /></strong>But pink-collar worker and other classifications with colours are less common. The ones most used are blue-collar and white-collar.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>What a pity! I quite like striped-dark-blue-and-pale-yellow-designer-collar worker.</p> 
<p><strong>Callum<br /></strong>You might like that, but nobody would understand what you meant. But don't worry, you'd look good in white or blue. It brings out your tan, works well in contrast with the colour of your eyes… and with your hair…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh, stop it Callum!</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello, welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Feifei…</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>…and hello, I'm Neil. So Feifei, did you enjoy Jane's leaving party last night?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh yeah, it was great. Free food and free drink…</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>But that was the only reason was it? Weren't you sad to see her leave? You've worked with her for many years.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh… right… yes. Very sad. Such a shame to see her go. We were such good friends.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Friends! Really? Didn't she tell the boss when you took that extra-long lunch break?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh yeah – but generally, we were best buddies.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hmm, and didn't you once punch her when she tried to chat up your boyfriend at the Christmas party?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>OK, OK, I didn't like her that much.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well it sounds like you were really her 'frenemy' – someone who pretends to be her friend but is really her enemy. It's a combination of two words – friend and enemy. Get it?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, a fren-emy! Hmm, I've never had one of those before.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Really? Well let's hear this word in action…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>She seems so false, I wouldn't trust her – she's just a frenemy.</p> 
<p>Tania's been my frenemy for years – I'd go for a quick drink with her but that's it!</p> 
<p>Tom's just my frenemy – I pretend to like him but really I can't stand him!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>If you pretend to be friends with someone but in reality you don't like each other then they are your 'frenemy'. I wonder if I was <em>her</em> frenemy?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>I'm afraid you were. She told me she was only friends with you so she could share your biscuits – and she didn't really like you. She told me at the party last night.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Thank goodness we're real friends Neil – at least we can be honest with each other.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well actually, I don't like you much either. I only pretend to be your friend when I'm presenting this programme!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh no! Now I've got two frenemies!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Oh don't cry Feifei. I was only joking.</p>"

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello Finn. Looking forward to another The English We Speak?</p> 
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Hi, Feifei! Oh yes, always…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Actually, before we begin, could you pass me the thingy?</p> 
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Which thingy? The script?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>No, no - not the script. The thingy behind you…</p> 
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br />Ah, you need a pen? Here you go.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>No. I've got a pen actually. Two pens. I mean that… thingy over there…</p> 
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br />Which thingy? Listen, I know this studio is a bit of a mess, isn't it? So if you keep saying 'thingy' we could be here all day!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Sorry, Finn. 'Thingy' is a word which we sometimes use when I can't remember or don't know the name of an object. </p> 
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br />It is indeed. And it can be used, informally, when you can't remember the name of a particular person too. And it's today's expression, Feifei?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, why not? 'Thingy' is our word today in The English We Speak. Let's hear some examples of how it's used. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>You want a recipe for stew? Ask… thingy. She was talking about a lovely one the other day.</p> 
<p>Sorry, I'm late for the meeting. Could you just pass me the thingy for my report… I mean… the stapler?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>That's it! I was asking for the… stopwatch! I need to time the programme, Finn. </p> 
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>No, you don't. The programme is over. And this stopwatch shouldn't really be here. It belongs to… to… he was looking for it the other day.<br /><strong><br />Feifei<br /></strong>Belongs to…? </p> 
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>It belongs to… thingy. </p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Come one, Finn. It belongs to Rob. I'll return it to him!</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye! </p>"
"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello. I'm Feifei and with me in the studio is ...</p> 
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Finn, hello!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hey, do you feel a bit tired, Finn? Well, I do. What a party yesterday!</p> 
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Yes, it was good, wasn't it? Great food, plenty to drink… </p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Now… forgive me for being nosey but…you said you were too busy working to have a love life. So… who was that beautiful woman you were with?</p> 
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br />Ah, that was … just a girl I know…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Come on, Finn, don’t be so mysterious. Everybody was looking at her. She looked like a supermodel! Is it serious? No offence, but how did you manage to attract a woman like that?</p> 
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br />What do you mean? I’m very handsome! But she’s not my girlfriend…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Just some eye candy, then? &nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br />That's not fair. I mean, yes she's beautiful – but eye candy means someone who is attractive, but not very interesting…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I know – just teasing! It sounds like you like her… </p> 
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Err, OK then, I do quite like her… </p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Ooh, you admitted it! </p> 
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>I know…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>We can also use eye candy to talk about things which look good but are not very useful. Let’s hear some examples. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I was going out with this gorgeous footballer but it didn’t last. He was just eye candy.</p> 
<p>This illustrated cookbook looks good but you can never find the ingredients for the recipes. These pictures are just eye candy!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well, the party was fun anyway. And you know what? Today I'm going on a date with a guy I met there. </p> 
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Mmm… is this the beginning of a romance, Feifei? </p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh, no. He’s very boring, actually. </p> 
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Just some eye candy then? </p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well… we'll see. But I want to make all my friends jealous!</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei</strong><strong><br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei and joining me is Harry.</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Hello there! And the popular modern expression we are going to look at in this programme is 'game changer'.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Game changer. We'll look at what it means and when you can use it. So Harry – did you end up buying a new TV like you were planning?</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>I certainly did&nbsp; - and then some! I don't know if 'TV' is really the right word for it though.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Why not?</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Well, it's so much more. It's got a 72-inch curved screen with ultimate high-definition and it's 3D. When you watch a programme, it's like you're really there.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Wow - it sounds amazing.</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>It is! TV will never be the same again. In TV terms, it's a real game changer.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>A game changer? What's that?</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Well, it's so unlike any normal TV, that it's changed the rules of what TVs are. You will never think of TV in the same way if you watch my TV – it's a new world of television.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So 'game changer' means something that is so new and different, it changes the rules of the game.</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Exactly. It could be technology, like my TV, or a person with new ideas, or a new direction in music or fashion. Any new innovation that changes the current situation.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I see. Let's listen to some examples:</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>The Beatles' album Sergeant Pepper was a real game changer – it transformed pop music forever.</p> 
<p>Our company needs a game changer – someone who can come in and rethink the way we do everything.</p> 
<p>Last year my boss said we could all work from home whenever we needed to. It's been a real game changer in the way we work.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So, some different types of game changers there. For people learning English, I suppose the internet has been a real game changer. You can study anytime, anywhere now.</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>You can – especially if you visit our website <a href=""http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/"">bbclearningenglish.com</a>.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Very true, if you want to improve you English, our website can be a real game changer. So, I suppose you're going to be staying in tonight.</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Me? No, I'm going out.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>But, you've got an amazing new TV, the game changer.</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>I know, but it's Thursday, and there's never anything good on TV on Thursdays. And to be honest, I think I've been watching too much TV. I need to get out more.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh well – I guess your TV didn't change the game for long. Join us again for more The English We Speak.</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>

<p>(In a park by a pond)</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />What a pleasant day, Neil! I love this park. Some of my best memories are from walking around here, feeding the ducks…</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />My best memories are… well, from across the pond.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Really? What sort of thing did you do over there?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Shopping! They have all sorts of products over there which are cheaper than here!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Good shops with cheap stuff… mmm… I want to go there, but I can't really see from here!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />I'm talking about across the pond. And the food there is so delicious! Big portions and all very tasty! I love Mississippi mud pie!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />That's a chocolate cake, isn't it? I want some! Where is the restaurant? I want to go there now!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />But I told you – it's too far away. It's across the pond!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Don't be lazy. We can just go walk around the pond. But all I can see are ducks!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Here in Britain, when we say 'across the pond' or 'the other side of the pond' we might be referring to the Atlantic Ocean and the United States. Because there's so much contact between the two continents, we compare the ocean to a pond.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />So the cake and the shops are… in America!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Yes! Let's hear some examples of how this expression is used.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />The latest Woody Allen movie was very popular on both sides of the pond. It was praised by critics and popular among cinemagoers.</p> 
<p>Many American actors are starring in plays in London's West End. But this is Shakespeare’s territory and I think the best theatre is still on our side of the pond!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />You look disappointed, Feifei. It's the chocolate cake, isn't it?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Yes, it is.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Come on. Let's find a nice coffee shop and I’ll buy you a tasty dessert. We don't have to go to New York for that.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />No we don't. London is a great city!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Come on, let's go!</p> 
<p><strong>Both</strong><br />Bye!</p>"
"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Hello, this is The English We Speak, with me Feifei…</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />… and me Neil. Hello!</p> 
<p>(Rob opens the studio door)</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Hi Neil! Sorry to interrupt. I just want to confirm that you're coming to my party. Are you?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Yes, of course. Thanks, Rob. It will be a blast!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Cool. It'll be great to have you there! I'll let you get back to your recording. See you!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />No problem.</p> 
<p>(Finn opens the studio door)</p> 
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br />Hi Neil! Just to tell you my presentation was a success. Your advice made all the difference!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Oh that's great news, Finn. Always happy to help.</p> 
<p>(Vera opens the studio door)</p> 
<p><strong>Vera</strong><br />Hi Neil! I just wanted to say thanks for putting me in contact with Brian from the IT department. He sorted out my computer problems.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />No problem, Vera. Any time you need a good contact, just ask.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Wait a minute! We have a programme to do here!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Well, what can I do, I'm a people person! In English, you say someone is a 'people person' when they are good at dealing with other people. They're helpful and have the ability to motivate people. People like me, Feifei.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />I know, I know. I appreciate your people skills too. Let's hear some examples of how this expression is used.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />Callum is a people person. He gets along with everybody and would make a great manager.</p> 
<p>You know, you should go to the party even if you don't know anybody there. You're a people person and by the end of the night you'll have made lots of new friends.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />So many people outside the studio… Neil, who are they?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Oh, these are colleagues and friends I've helped out a bit recently.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />But this is… it's a crowd!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />I told you: I'm a people person! Hello everybody! I'll be there in a minute!</p> 
<p><strong>Both</strong><br />Bye!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>"
"<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to <em>The English We Speak </em>where we teach you English words and phrases which you might not find in your dictionary. I'm Rob. </p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>… and I'm Feifei. Hello.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I am getting very excited, it's nearly Christmas. </p> 
<p><strong>Feifei <br /></strong>I love Christmas! All the food, the presents, the silly games and the…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh, Feifei, did you hear the boss wants us to agree to work on Christmas Day?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Really? Why? I would never agree to that! </p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I don't know, but he wanted us to agree to it. So I told him us agreeing to work on Christmas Day would be like turkeys voting for Christmas.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>'Like turkeys voting for Christmas'? Rob, I know you like your turkey dinner but what's this got to do with turkeys?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Let me explain, Feifei. As you know, lots of people eat turkeys at Christmas. So, do you think if the turkeys had a choice, they would vote for Christmas?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>No, of course not, it would be crazy for them to vote for Christmas because they get eaten.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>That's right. So in English, we use this idiom 'like turkeys voting for Christmas' as a metaphor when someone accepts a situation which will have a negative outcome for them. </p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ah, so in our case, if we agree to work on Christmas Day then we can't have the food, the presents or the drinks; more importantly, we can't spend time with our family which will be really disappointing for us.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Exactly! It will be 'like turkeys voting for Christmas'. Let's hear some people using this phrase.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong><em>Workers agreeing to pay cuts would be like turkeys voting for Christmas.</em></p> 
<p><em>It would be like turkeys voting for Christmas if people asked for a tax rise.</em></p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Remember this is an informal saying so do take note of the context it's used in. </p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Thank you Rob for teaching us this humorous idiom. All this talking of turkey is making me very hungry. </p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Me too, maybe we should just skip work today and go find some turkey to eat?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Now Rob, if I said yes to that, it would really be like turkeys voting for Christmas. </p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Ha ha…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Do join us again for another <em>The English We Speak</em>. We wish you a very Happy Christmas!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Merry Christmas!</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />… and hello, I'm Rob. So Feifei, how was your holiday – did you go anywhere special?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Yes, I did. I went walking.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Very healthy. And where did you go?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Oh, I walked up Mount Everest…. It was tough and cold but I made it.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Oh… You walked up Mount Everest – the highest mountain in the world? Are you sure?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />You don't think I'm fit enough to do it, do you?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Come on Feifei, you're pulling my leg.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />I'm not even touching you.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />No, I don't mean you're actually pulling my leg – I mean you're lying aren't you? You're joking with me?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />You think I'm not telling the truth – I'm tricking you? But am I?!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Come on Feifei, stop teasing me – you didn't do it did you?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />I did. I'll show you some photos. But let me hear some more examples of the phrase in action first…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />A: So I got to the restaurant and sat down at my table and guess who was sitting on the next table – George Clooney!<br />B: You're pulling my leg!</p> 
<p>I was pulling his leg when I said I was going to marry Jenny but he believed me and bought me a present!</p> 
<p>Oh stop pulling my leg – you can't have won the lottery, you didn't even buy a ticket!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />So to pull someone's leg means to fool or trick them but in a fun way. Look at this photo Rob, you can see how much snow there was on Everest – and look, there's me on top.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Hold on – this is a trick photo – you had this taken in one of those photo-booths where you stand in front of a big screen. You're not pulling my leg!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Ooo… ouch… actually…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />It looks like you've pulled something in your own leg – a muscle, maybe? Who's the fool now?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Ok, I didn't walk up Everest. I was teasing you but you almost believed me!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Didn't.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Did!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Did not.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Did.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>"
"<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I am Rob.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p>
<p>Hello everyone. I am Feifei.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong></p>
<p>Can you guess what I have brought for you to try?</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p>
<p>No, but I hope it's not one of those… errr, disgusting pies you always make.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong></p>
<p>Hey, come on Feifei have some faith in me. I know you like fried dumplings a lot, so I have made these pork and chive dumplings especially for you!</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p>
<p>Fried dumplings? They look more like burnt dumplings.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong></p>
<p>Just try one – I'm sure you'll like it.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p>
<p>Rob, they just don't look that appetising.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong></p>
<p>Trust me Feifei, the proof is in the pudding.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p>
<p>In the pudding? Aren't these supposed to be dumplings?</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, these are dumplings. But I used the phrase 'the proof is in the pudding' to mean you can only judge the quality of something after you've tried it or used it.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p>
<p>I see. So 'the proof is in the pudding' is actually a real saying?</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it is. In the old days, people used to say 'the proof of the pudding is in the eating' – which means you have to eat the pudding to know what's inside it.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p>
<p>I like that saying. Although it does mean I've got to try your dumplings to know how bad they are.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong></p>
<p>Oh Feifei! Just give them a try – you won't be disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p>
<p>OK, OK. I'll try some. But first, let's hear some examples of how to use the phrase 'the proof is in the pudding'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Examples</strong></em></p>
<p>A: I don't believe this new flash washing machine can save water and energy.</p>
<p>B: But you haven't used it yet. The proof is the pudding.</p>
<p>A: This second-hand car does look a bit old – can you still drive it?</p>
<p>B: Well, why don't you test drive it? The proof is in the pudding.</p>
<p>A: Do you think this will work?</p>
<p>B: I don't know. But let's wait and see – the proof is in the pudding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong></p>
<p>Remember, in English we use the saying 'the proof is in the pudding' to mean you can judge the value or the quality of something only after you have tried it, experienced it or used it.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong>&nbsp;(Feifei munching away…)</p>
<p>Mmmm, yes, yes…</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong></p>
<p>So Feifei, do you like the dumplings?</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I do Rob. I really like the pork and chive filling.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong></p>
<p>I've finally made something you like!</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p>
<p>As you say Rob: &quot;the proof is in the pudding&quot;!</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for listening to The English We Speak.</p>

"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak with me Feifei...</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>...and me Rob. Hello. So Feifei have you heard the news?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>The news? What news? </p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>We're all going to get a big pay rise!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>A pay rise? But Rob are you sure? I haven't heard anyone else talk about it.&nbsp; </p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes, yes, I'm sure. Look at this leaflet here... it says it there in black and white. </p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>In black and white? But it's in colour - look, it says 'ten per cent' in red letters.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I don't mean it's printed in black and white - if someone says it's 'in black and white' they mean it's official - it's been printed or written down - so there is no dispute!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />So you're saying it's not gossip – it's true?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes, yes - I have proof of the pay rise on this piece of paper here. </p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />OK, well let me read it while we hear some more examples of this phrase...</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I have it here in black and white - I've got the job!</p> 
<p>I'm not going to start celebrating until I've seen the deal in black and white.</p> 
<p>We didn't believe the bank's offer of a loan until we saw it in black and white.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So, when something is in black and white it is clearly written down so it is believed to be true. But why in 'black and white' and not in 'red and blue' for example?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Well, it comes from the early days of printing when news and information was printed in black ink on white paper. Once something was printed it was official.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>OK - but hold on Rob - I've read this leaflet and it doesn't say we're getting a 10% pay rise - it just says we <em>deserve</em> a 10% pay rise - so no pay rise for us Rob.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>What? Are you sure?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes - look, it says it there - at the top - in black and white! </p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh I didn't see that.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>It just shows you - even if something is in black and white - you need to be able to read it&nbsp;first!</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak with me, Feifei…</p> 
<p><strong>Sian</strong><br />…and me, Sian. Hello! Hey Feifei what are you doing on your phone? We've got a programme to record.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Well you see I've got a really bad headache and it says here on this website that I might have a head injury, or maybe a tumour or…</p> 
<p><strong>Sian</strong><br />Or maybe you've just got a headache! Give me that phone… you're just scaring yourself!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Hang on it says here that I should go to the hospital if I have these other symptoms. Maybe I do have a fever… I am feeling quite hot.</p> 
<p><strong>Sian</strong><br />That's because it's boiling in here – I'm hot too… and I'm starting to get a headache. I know exactly what's wrong with you – you have a case of cyberchondria!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Cyberchondria? Oh dear I knew something was wrong. That sounds serious – what is it?</p> 
<p><strong>Sian</strong><br />A cyberchondriac is someone who looks up medical advice on the internet for every symptom they have and then gets really anxious because they think they have a serious illness! Just like you're doing.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Oh, like a 'hypochondriac' - that's someone who imagines illnesses that they don't have, isn't it?</p> 
<p><strong>Sian</strong><br />Exactly, this term is a combination of 'cyber' – relating to computers – and hypochondriac. Let's hear some examples...<br /><br /><strong>Examples</strong><br />There are so many medical websites nowadays, it's no wonder more and more people are self-diagnosing and becoming cyberchondriacs.</p> 
<p>Ana: I was convinced that I had this really rare disease that I read about online. Turns out I just wasn't drinking enough water!</p> 
<p>Joe: Ha! You're such a cyberchondriac!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Right, let's get on with the programme – I haven't brought my glasses today so I'm afraid I can't read the script very well.</p> 
<p><strong>Sian</strong><br />What? You've forgotten your glasses? Well no wonder you've got a headache.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Oh yeah that could be it. Phew I was convinced something terrible was wrong with me. Right, let's get on with the programme.</p> 
<p><strong>Sian</strong><br />Hang on there's a link here to the 'ten most dangerous tropical diseases' I'll just have a quick look….</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />But you haven't even been to a tropical country lately. Put the phone down!</p> 
<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>Alright! See you later. Bye!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei and I'm waiting for Rob… I have some good news for him!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh hi Feifei. You're looking very pleased with yourself.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Yes, I am. You know that new singer we really really like and wanted to go and see?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>You mean Justin Timberriver?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes him. And you know that his world tour is a sell-out – there are no tickets left?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes, sadly.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well, look at these!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Wow! Two tickets to see Justin Timberriver in London tomorrow! That's amazing, how did you manage to pull those out of the hat?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Err Rob - I didn't pull them out of anyone's hat - I used my own money to buy them from a friend.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No Feifei - if you 'pull something out of a hat' it means you produce something unexpectedly - by surprise - and solves a problem.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>OK, I see! So these tickets are an unexpected surprise?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br /> Yes - I thought we would never get any. Let's hear some more examples while I calm down!</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>We thought we'd never complete the project on time but somehow, Javeed managed to pull it out of the hat.</p> 
<p>Our team has had a bad season but they still managed to pull a cup victory out of the hat by the end of it.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So, if you pull something out of a hat, you do something that is not expected and it makes a bad situation better. You can also say 'to pull something out of thin air'. So it's like magic?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes. It's just like how a magician pulls a rabbit out of a hat – I don't suppose you could do that could you?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>No Rob. But maybe you could pull something out of the hat for me?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh, what's that?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>The tickets cost &pound;100 each – could I have the money now please?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>&pound;100? Where am I going to find that?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Look inside that silly hat you're wearing.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>It's not silly.</p> 
<p><strong>Both</strong><br /> Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello, I'm Neil… but where is Feifei?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>… sorry I'm late! Is it time for The English We Speak?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>It is Feifei – but catch your breath and have a seat. Are you ok? You look a bit of a… mess!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Me? A mess! You would be a mess if you had been where I have been.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>OK calm down… and what's that smell?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So you think I smell now! I've been to the rubbish dump!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>The rubbish dump?! Why did you go there?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Because I was looking for Rob earlier and someone said he was down in the dumps.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Feifei, that is the last place you will find someone who is down in the dumps. It's just a saying that describes someone who is unhappy, fed up and sometimes feels there is no hope.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh I get it! Being depressed or unhappy is a miserable feeling – a bit like being at a rubbish dump, actually.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Exactly. Let's hear some examples…<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Don't be so down in the dumps, you're going on holiday tomorrow!</p> 
<p>Oh it's Monday again, no wonder I feel so down in the dumps.</p> 
<p>Reshma has been so down in the dumps since her boyfriend left her.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So that's being 'down in the dumps' – feeling unhappy and miserable. So I've had a wasted trip – but I wonder why Rob is 'down in the dumps'?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>It could be because his football team lost… again.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>No, he’s used to that happening. It must be something more serious than that.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong> <br /> I know – he's feeling sad because he's not presenting this wonderful programme with you – it's such a great script isn't it!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>There's only one place for this script Neil – down in the dump!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Ha ha, very funny!</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>OK. Not again. Why oh why is Feifei late for the studio this time? Seriously…&nbsp;That does it. I'm gonna give her a call… Great. Let me go out and take a look.&nbsp;Feifei?! Feifei, where are you? Where has she gone? Oh, is that…? There she is!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Oh, oh, hi, Neil.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Where have you been? I've been looking <strong>all over the shop</strong> for you!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong><strong>All over the shop</strong>? Well, I wasn't in a shop. I was in… the toilet!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Thanks for the information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>And yes, before you tell me – I do know what <strong>all over the shop</strong> means. It means 'everywhere'.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well, I'm just glad I've found you. Now we can finally start the programme and explain this expression: <strong>all over the shop</strong>. Oh, we've already done that.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Yes. It usually means 'everywhere' – when describing a search for something, or an untidy arrangement of things. Like in these examples:</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Where were you? We looked <strong>all over the shop</strong> for you.</p> 
<p>He left his dirty washing <strong>all over the shop</strong>. Our house was a real mess!</p> 
<p>I spilled wine <strong>all over the shop</strong> when I tried to open that bottle. Oops.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>It can also describe someone or something very disorganised. Listen to this:</p> 
<p><strong>Example<br /></strong>Sorry, I'm a bit <strong>all over the shop</strong> this morning. I forgot my ticket, my phone… I left my laptop at home. What's wrong with me?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So there you go. You can look <strong>all over the shop</strong> for something or someone.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>And you can also leave things <strong>all over the shop</strong> – like the dirty clothes.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>And you yourself can also be <strong>all over the shop</strong> – describing someone who is forgetful or disorganised. Though not you, of course, Feifei.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Never me.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>And that is the expression for this programme. Thank you, Feifei… Feifei? Feifei? Where’s she gone? Oh, a message. &quot;Just off to the shops. Need anything?&quot; Very funny. Bye!&nbsp;</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So, big presentation today, Feifei! How are you feeling?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yeah, I’m ok, Neil. All prepared. I do feel a bit nervous… I just need to remind myself to slow down and take a sip of water when I feel anxious!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Good plan! OK, I'll see you later. Good luck… Hey! So how did it go?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Not great.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>What happened? You lost your bottle?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Actually, I took a glass of water.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Oh right. You know the phrase 'to lose your bottle' means 'to lose your confidence and fail to do something, or decide not to do it'.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p> 
<p>Thanks for teaching me this phrase when I'm feeling awful.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes, sorry. You can also simply say 'to bottle it' which also means 'to lose your courage and fail to do something'. Err, examples time?<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>He was going to ask his girlfriend to marry him but lost his bottle at the last minute. She asked him instead.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I thought about painting my front door bright green but I bottled it. I went for a conservative grey instead.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Anyway Neil, aren't you giving a presentation this afternoon?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Err... I was going to.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh? You mean, you're not going to do it now?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well, you see, I just had so much work on this week, and I've not really had time at all…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yeah, yeah, I get it. You bottled it.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>You got me. I just hate presentations!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well, that makes two of us! Bye.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Morning Neil. In a rush today, were you?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Just a bit, Feifei. You know, kids, breakfast, commute. The usual. Why?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well – I noticed your shirt isn't ironed.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Very attentive of you.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>And your shirt has – ketchup on it?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Oops, yes – beans for breakfast.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>And you haven't shaved, have you?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well, no. Erm…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>You really do need to make more of an effort.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Feifei, why are you having a go at me?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Relax, Neil. I'm just giving you the opportunity to use the phrase we are teaching, which is: 'have a go'!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well that's a relief.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>'To have a go at someone', as we've just seen, means to criticise someone.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>That's right. Here are some examples.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>The boss really had a go at Michaela after she offended our clients.</p> 
<p>Susie had a go at her husband last night. He'd forgotten all about her birthday.</p> 
<p>Why do you always have a go at me? Why can't you say something nice?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>That's our phrase. 'To have a go at someone' - which means to criticise someone.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>There. Can we be nice to each other now?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well, we can have a go!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Ah, very clever. 'To have a go' has another meaning – 'to try'.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes – if you have a go at something, you try it.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Why don't you have a go at making an example sentence, Feifei?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ok then. I'm going to have a go at cooking a Thai curry from scratch.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Tasty. 'To have a go' meaning 'to try'. And one last thing, Feifei. Do I really look scruffy?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Not at all. Though you could shave once in a while.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>I'll have a go. Just for you Feifei.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><strong> + Neil<br /></strong>Bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei<br /> </strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Feifei</p> 
<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>…and I'm, Sian. Hello! How was your weekend Feifei?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> It was awesome! I went to that film premi&egrave;re - and look who I managed to get a photo with on the red carpet!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Sian</strong><br /> Oh wow! He's even got his arm around you!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> I know – Exciting huh? I'm going to get this picture printed out and put on my wall!</p> 
<p><strong>Sian</strong><br /> Ha ha oh dear – have you seen this guy behind you making a funny face? Look here on the left.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Where? Let me see! Oh no, I didn't notice him. Oh he's totally ruined it.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Sian</strong><br /> You know we have a word for that? When an unexpected person appears in a photo as it's being taken?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Yes – it's called a photobomb or you can photobomb someone. Let's hear some examples:</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Oh no! My graduation photo has been totally ruined by a photobomber! Look</p> 
<p>This photo of my girlfriend and me would have been really nice, but my sister photobombed it!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So people photobomb as a kind of practical joke? I don't think it's very nice to ruin someone's photo though.</p> 
<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>Well not always, photobombing – can also be done by accident, in fact even animals can photobomb! Lets hear another example.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Look at this hilarious website showing pictures of animals photobombing. I think the goat one is the funniest!</p> 
<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>You know Feifei I don't think it's ruined your photo – it's actually really funny. Look here, I was photobombed once too.</p> 
<p><strong> Feifei</strong><br />That's a nice pic … hang on! Is that the Queen in the background?</p> 
<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>Yes, I was photobombed by the Queen of England!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well that photobomb has improved your photo – I don't think it's the same for mine though.&nbsp;I'm going to find a way to get rid of him from my perfect photo. Bye!</p> 
<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>Good luck. Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Callum<br /></strong>Oh, hello, Feifei. Already here to present The English We Speak.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>What do you mean by 'already here', Callum?! And what are all these bags you have with you?</p> 
<p><strong>Callum<br /></strong>Shopping.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Shopping?! I'm here in the studio, waiting for you and you went shopping?! This is absurd.</p> 
<p><strong>Callum<br /></strong>Oh, come on, Feifei, we still have a couple of minutes to go. Don't be such a drama queen!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Drama queen?!</p> 
<p><strong>Callum<br /></strong>Yes, drama queen! We say someone is a drama queen when he or she becomes very angry or upset over tiny small things like…&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>… like you being late…</p> 
<p><strong>Callum<br /></strong>Not late - shopping. Now, let's hear some examples of how the expression 'drama queen' is used.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>A: Oh, it's raining and my new hairdo is ruined! All those hours in the hairdresser for nothing!<br />B: Don't be such a drama queen. Here, take my umbrella.</p> 
<p>I'm not dining out with Peter anymore. If the dish is not cooked exactly the way he likes he makes a big fuss. He's such a drama queen!</p> 
<p><strong>Callum<br /></strong>That's it, Feifei. And now, here, in my bag…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>What, now you're going to sort out your shopping?</p> 
<p><strong>Callum<br /></strong>This is for you, Feifei!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh, a present for me?! Oh… you shouldn't have… &nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Callum<br /></strong>You didn't want people to know it's your birthday, but… well, happy birthday, Feifei!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ohhh! I don't know what to say… I guess I'll have to take back my words. Thank you, Callum. You know what? We can make the programme a bit later. Let's celebrate!</p> 
<p><strong>Callum<br /></strong>OK.</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Hi Feifei, what are you up to?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hi Neil. Oh, I'm just… ironing a few clothes.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>That's a big pile of clothes.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I'm going on holiday! Everything has to be neat and clean.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>You're even ironing your shorts!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Nothing like perfectly ironed shorts.<br /></p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Nah, that's <strong>long</strong>, Feifei!<br /></p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> They're shorts – not long!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Haha – very funny. You know what I mean.<br /></p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> <strong>Long</strong> is British street slang which we use to talk about a task which is boring and not really worth it.<br /></p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Exactly. Ironing is <strong>long</strong>. It's dull and takes forever.<br /></p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>That's because you do it all wrong. Here, let me show you, while we play these examples.&nbsp;<br /></p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I can't believe you're cleaning the whole house. That's <strong>long</strong>, bro. Come out and enjoy the sun.<br /></p> 
<p>A: Why don't you stick with your diet?<br />B: Dieting is <strong>long</strong>. I just eat what I want and go to the gym instead.<br /></p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>You know, Feifei, you're right. Ironing isn't so bad.<br /></p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Just you wait. You'll be ironing your socks before you know it.<br /></p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So, where are you off to on holiday?<br /></p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I'm travelling around the world for five months!<br /></p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Wow, five months! That's long.<br /></p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Aha – but do you mean <strong>long</strong> – as in boring?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Of course not… Five months is a long holiday. Have a great trip!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>You can do all my ironing when I get back.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So long, Feifei. Bye!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Hello welcome to The English We Speak from BBC Learning English. I'm Rob.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh hello…I'm Feifei.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>What's wrong Feifei?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I'm stressed – I've got an exam tomorrow – I hate exams.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Me too. What you need to do is plan your revision a bit more, take lots of breaks, and maybe go for a run.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>You seem to know a lot about preparing for exams. Where did you study? &nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh nowhere you would have heard of. It's called the university of life.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>The university of life. Is that in London?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>It's doesn't actually exist – when someone says they've been to the university of life it means they are wise but not necessarily educated – they've learnt everything just from experiencing life.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I see. Hmm, so no exams.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>That's right. I've just got a qualification in life! Let's hear some more examples of this phrase…</p> 
<p><strong>Example</strong><strong>s<br /></strong>I set up the business without any qualifications – everything I learnt was from the university of life.</p> 
<p>The university of life taught me to be polite to everyone you meet; you never know when you might see them again.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>The university of life – it's where you learn from life not books. So I should learn a lesson from you Rob? &nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes, chill out – don't stress about exams – they're a waste of time.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Really!!! Hold on a minute. If I remember correctly, you failed your exams and you were kicked out of university.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well…err… maybe. But that was a life experience… and I learned that studying wasn't for me.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hmmm, it sounds like you've been to The school of hard knocks.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>The school of hard knocks?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, it's an unpleasant experience that you learn from. Anyway, I'm off to revise for my exams – I'd rather stay at my university rather than go to yours!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Fair enough.</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye.</p>"
"<p>(Feifei and Finn are in the park feeding the ducks.)</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /></strong>It's so nice to be here in the park, Finn.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Yes, it is Feifei. I love coming here and feeding the ducks.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Being here helps take my mind off things. I had a fight with my mother-in-law yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none"" /></strong>What was it about?</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Well, she is always criticising everything I do. Last night it was my cooking!</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Well, don't take too much notice of it, Feifei. My mother-in-law is the same. But it's just like water off a duck's back to me.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /></strong>A duck's back?!</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Yes, in English the phrase 'water off a duck's back' means that criticisms or negative things have no effect on you - they're just like water off a duck's back - we don't let them upset or affect us.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /></strong>What an unusual expression!</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Yes, it is but, you know, it makes sense. Look at those ducks in the water...</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Ah, I get it! They have oily feathers and water can't get through them - it doesn't affect them - so I shouldn't let the criticism affect me and make me upset.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none"" /></strong>That's right. And the phrase 'water off a duck's back' is what we're teaching today in The English We Speak. Now, let's listen to some examples of how it's used.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<p>I won't give up on my singing career just because someone said I'm no good. Criticism is water off a duck's back to me!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I told John not to drive so fast but it was like water off a duck's back. Last week he crashed his new car. Thankfully nobody was hurt.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Feifei, which dish was it that you cooked that your mother-in-law didn't like? I'm making dinner tonight and I need a recipe...</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Well, this is probably not the place to mention it...</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Oh, I'm intrigued. Can't you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /></strong>I cooked Peking Duck. You'll need pancakes, spring onions, a nice juicy roast duck...</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Oh, the ducks are not happy!</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /></strong>I don't think they like my recipe at all. Let's go Finn. I can give you a good chicken recipe instead.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none"" /></strong>I'd like that. My mother-in-law is coming for dinner too. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Welcome to The English We Speak with me, Rob.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> And me Feifei. Hello! So how did you interview go?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br /> You know, quite good… ok… well not bad.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> So did you get the promotion?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br /> Well… no. I didn't… it was a bit of a slap in the face actually.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>A slap in the face? Did they hit you?!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No, no, no. I mean not getting the job is a bit of an insult – I was the right man for the job – look at all my qualifications and experience.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh dear. You sound quite offended Rob.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>That's what 'a slap in the face' means – it's an action that can be seen as an insult or cause offence. It can also cause disappointment because you were expecting a more positive outcome.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Like getting that promotion?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Exactly. Here are some more examples…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>After all the extra work we put in, it was a slap in the face not to win the contract.<br />Not being invited on his stag do, was a real slap in the face – I thought I was his best friend!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> So 'a slap in the face' is an insult – or an action that causes offence or disappointment. It's not actually a physical slap in the face then?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>That's right.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So what are you going to do about getting a promotion?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br /> Well to be honest, Feifei, it wasn't much of a promotion anyway – it was quite a boring job role and no more money – an idiot could have done it – I think you would have been good at it…</p> 
<p>[SLAP]</p> 
<p>…ow, what was that?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>That’s a real slap in the face!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Was it something I said?</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Welcome to The English We Speak. I’m Feifei.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> And I’m Neil.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> And today we’re teaching a British slang expression – or maybe just half an expression!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>The phrase is <strong>not half</strong>. Two simple words – but you need to know what they mean when used together.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Let’s try it out first and see if you can work out what it means. For example, Neil, you really enjoyed that pizza, didn’t you?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong><strong>Not half</strong>! I love pizza. And Feifei, you love playing darts, don’t you?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Darts, <strong>not half</strong>! I play every night. So – what does <strong>not half</strong> mean? It means ‘very much’ in these answers. When I replied “<strong>not half</strong>” I meant: ‘Yes, very much.’ I really like darts.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> And do you?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> What?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Like darts?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Erm, that’s not the point. I’m trying to give an example.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> For the record, I do love pizza.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>A: That party was awesome!<br />B: <strong>Not half</strong>, mate. The music was incredible. </p> 
<p>A: <strong>Not half</strong> is a useful phrase, huh?<br />B: <strong>Not half</strong>.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ahh, that was a funny example. Now, before we go – let’s teach a variation of this phrase.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>In this version, we have <strong>not half</strong> followed by an adjective. For example: I just got back from Singapore. It’s <strong>not half</strong> expensive.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So – that means it’s very expensive! <strong>Not half</strong> expensive. Similarly, if I were to say: “Your new haircut’s <strong>not half</strong> nice, Neil!”&nbsp; </p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>You would be saying my haircut is very nice. Was that just another example?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh no, I meant it.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Too kind.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Er, thanks! So there we are – <strong>not half</strong> meaning ‘very much’.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>And <strong>not half</strong> with an adjective.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>See you next time.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Bye…&nbsp;</p>"
"<p>(Doorbell rings, door opens)</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Hi, Feifei. Fancy a lift to the office?</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Hello, Finn. Sorry, I'm not actually going in to the office today. I'm taking care of my niece.</p>
<p>(Baby talking)</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Oh, what a sweet baby!</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Isn't she adorable? You know, I'm thinking about becoming a full-time babysitter!</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Oh, really?</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Hang on, Finn. (To the baby) Time for your bath, little one!</p>
<p>(Baby laughs)</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none"" /></strong>But Feifei, you don't actually want to change your job, do you?</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Well, I enjoy my job. But sometimes, you know, it can be very stressful. I feel like a change...</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Really? But you're so good at your job! I know how you love completing projects. And we'd all miss you so much.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /></strong>I know. But dealing with babies is so much easier.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Well, just don't throw the baby out with the bathwater, Feifei.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /></strong>What do you mean?! I know how to take care of a baby. Why would I throw her out?</p>
<p>(Baby crying)</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /></strong>See what you've done.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Sorry! 'Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater' is an English idiom which means: 'don't lose something valuable while we're getting rid of something else that we don't want'. So I was talking about your job, Feifei. Just because you find it stressful – that's the thing you don't want – don't stop completely and lose what's valuable.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Ah, I see. So you think my job gives me satisfaction, in spite of the long hours in the office… so I shouldn't give it up.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none"" /></strong>That's right. 'Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater' is the expression in this edition of The English We Speak. Now let's hear some examples of how it's used.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<p>I know you don't like the dress, but I think if you make a few changes to it, it will look lovely. It's such beautiful material. Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. I know the wallpaper is ugly, but this is a lovely house. We can always redecorate.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Thank you, Finn. Having colleagues like you who care for me is so important. You know what? I don't want to be a babysitter after all.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none"" /></strong>That's the spirit!</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /></strong>So… here's the baby and… well, the nappies are in that drawer.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Feifei, what do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Well, Finn, someone has to take care of the baby. I'm going to the office. See you later. Bye!</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none"" /></strong>And I'm left holding the baby… Bye!</p>
<p><strong>Baby<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Ba… Ba…</p>"
"<p><strong>Finn</strong></p>
<p>Hello Feifei. I didn't know you shopped at this supermarket too.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p>
<p>Hi Finn. Usually I don't. But it's close to the office and I have to rush home to welcome an important guest.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong></p>
<p>Who is it?&nbsp; Someone I know?</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p>
<p>No, it's my landlady. She's coming to collect some of her post and… well, I want to make her like me because next month the contract on my flat is due to be renewed and she might want to increase the rent.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I see what you mean. So you'd better butter her up then!</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p>
<p>Butter? Oh, yes. But I'm a pretty bad cook. If I bake a cake it would probably be horrible!</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong></p>
<p>No. I don't mean butter for a cake. In English when you say you'll 'butter someone up' you mean you'll be especially nice to them in the hope they'll do something good for you in return.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p>
<p>Oh, I see. So I'll be nice to her and pay her compliments so that she likes me and keeps the rent low. I'll 'butter her up'! But isn't it a bit insincere?</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong></p>
<p>Well, it can have a negative connotation, yes. Let's hear some examples of how to use 'to butter someone up' or 'to butter up someone', which is today's expression in The English We Speak.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<p><em>Johnny: I was very impressed with your presentation, Mrs Beany. You are really intelligent and perceptive and…</em></p>
<p><em>Mrs Beany: Don't waste your time buttering me up, Johnny. I'm not raising your salary anytime soon.</em></p>
<p><em>The director was always ready to butter up Angelina Jolie. He knew she was looking for her next role and he wanted her in his movie. </em></p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p>
<p>Oh, look. It's 6pm already. I'm very late. I might not be on time to meet my landlady and she'll be angry with me. She's a very busy woman.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, well, then you are in a jam!</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p>
<p>Jam?!</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong></p>
<p>In English when you say someone 'is in a jam' you mean they are in a difficult situation – but that's a different kind of jam!</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p>
<p>All these expressions about food...</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong></p>
<p>I know. We have a huge appetite for food expressions. But let's leave some for another day. Bye!</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p>
<p>Bye!</p>

"<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello I'm Feifei and this is The English We Speak. With me today is Rob…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hello everyone.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Rob, are you OK – you look in pain?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I am – I've just been to the dentist. Ouch.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hmm, not my favourite place – but I guess you had to go to research today's piece of authentic English?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Excuse me?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well today's expression is 'to cut your teeth' - and dentists look at teeth?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Sorry Feifei, that's one tooth-related expression that doesn't need a dentist. When you 'cut your teeth' you get your first experience doing something in a particular job.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh really. So it's like work experience?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes, that's one way of learning a new skill which you might use later in your job. I cut my teeth in radio production by working in local radio….</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>… and you're still cutting your teeth now Rob?!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Ha ha, let's hear some examples of this phrase shall we?</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Dan cut his teeth on a local newspaper before landing a job on a national daily.</p> 
<p>He cut his teeth running the junior football club before becoming a professional referee.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So 'to cut your teeth' means to acquire initial practice or experience in a particular job or activity. We could say it's where you get your basic skills.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Correct – so where do you think you cut your teeth for this job Fefei?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I cut my media teeth at university.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Ouch!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei&nbsp;<br /></strong>Sorry, what did I say?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No it's not you – it's this filling I had done – that's why I went to the dentist. He really was rough.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Rob, I think you should go home and rest.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Maybe!</p> 
<p><strong>Both</strong><br /> Bye!</p>"
"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hi Feifei. What a beautiful woollen shawl you're wearing! But it looks far too elegant to use for just another day in the office…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I know, Rob. I wanted to give it to Lisa, now that she's got that promotion…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Really? But she's hardly even said hello to you since her promotion and you used to be friends…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I know. She's been giving me the cold shoulder. That's why I brought this woollen shawl for her.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Feifei, you do know there's a difference between Lisa's shoulders being cold because it's winter and her 'giving you the cold shoulder', don't you? You can't just warm her shoulders and be friends again.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, I do. In English, someone giving you the cold shoulder means they're behaving in a way that is not friendly at all and they're doing it for no obvious reason.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes. It means they are rejecting you or ignoring you. And 'give the cold shoulder' is today's expression in The English We Speak.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Let's hear some examples.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>After Mary divorced her rich husband all their friends gave her the cold shoulder. She was not invited to their lavish parties anymore.</p> 
<p>My brother told our parents I haven't been studying at all and my marks are low. I'm not happy and I've been giving him the cold shoulder. Let's see if he's got the message.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Rob, I know what giving someone the cold shoulder means, but even so I think this shawl might help me get Lisa to change how she's acting.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>How come?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well, Lisa loves fashion and designer clothes. As soon as she sees me with this lovely shawl, she'll be impressed and stop ignoring me. She won't think she's better than me anymore!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well, and if you lend it to her, she might not feel cold anymore… it's been rather cold in the last few weeks...</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes. This woollen shawl will stop her having cold shoulders and might even stop her giving me the cold shoulder. How about that?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Now that is a clever use of the English language!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Bye.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Bye bye.</p>"
"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak, with me Feifei...</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><strong><br /></strong>...and me, Rob. Hello!<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong> <br />Rob, I've been meaning to ask... you've got a car haven't you?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes, Feifei, I have.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong> <br />Is it a quite special car? You know, a valuable, expensive one?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No no, it's just an old car - but it gets me around. Why are you asking?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong> <br />Oh no reason... you don't use it much do you?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No... Feifei there's no need to go around the houses - just say what you want to say.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong> <br />OK... can I borrow your car please? But don't worry, I won't take it around the houses - I just want to go to the supermarket.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Ha! Feifei when I said there's no need 'to go around the houses'; I wasn't referring to where you drive my car. I mean, you don't have to waste time saying lots of unimportant things before you actually say what you want to say.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong> <br />I see! So I should just say what I want to say - I should get to the point?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes, that's another way of putting it. Basically it means you take a long time to say or do something, when in reality it can be done or said a lot quicker. Let's hear some examples of the phrase 'to go around the houses' in action...</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p> 
<p>Don't go around the houses; just tell me straight, what have you done?</p> 
<p>He went all around the houses talking about the match but all I wanted to know was who won?</p> 
<p>I didn't know how to tell him he'd failed his exams so I went all around the houses before I let him know.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong> <br />So, to go around the houses means you go a long way round before asking what you want to ask. Rob, you haven't answered <em>my</em> question yet.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh yes, what was the question?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong> <br />Can I borrow your car... please?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh well, erm, I need to fill it up with petrol...</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong> <br />Oh right...</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>And I need to drive to work...</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong> <br />But that's not until Monday!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>It's not very tidy inside...</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Rob - don't go around the houses - your answer is 'no' isn't it?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes Feifei. You can't borrow it. I crashed it last week - nobody can drive it!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>You certainly won't be going around any houses then Rob!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Very funny Feifei!</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>…and hello, I'm Rob. Err, Feifei what are you doing?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I'm making a cake – a chocolate cake - obviously!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Why are you making a chocolate cake?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>It's Helen's birthday. What's wrong with that Rob?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well, for a start we are in a radio studio not a kitchen. Also, you've only got five minutes before she arrives – and you're putting salt in the cake mix not sugar.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ooops!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>It's a recipe for disaster!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>A recipe for disaster? No, look, it's a recipe for a chocolate cake Rob.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong><em>That</em> might be – but a recipe for disaster means a combination of things that will, at some point, go wrong and cause harm, damage or in this case, humiliation – in other words it will end in trouble.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So the phrase isn't about cooking? Oh dear Rob, this wasn't the recipe I wanted to follow!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No. Let's hear some examples of this phrase in action – and we can work out how to limit the damage.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>My doctor says drinking too much, not exercising enough, and having a stressful job are a recipe for disaster. He says I might die young!</p> 
<p>I'm not looking forward to the party. Having my wife and ex-girlfriend in the same room will be a recipe for disaster!</p> 
<p>Watch out on the road tonight – all that rain followed by freezing temperatures is a recipe for disaster.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So put another way, 'a recipe for disaster' is a phrase that means someone's actions will result in things going badly wrong. So what problem is my cake making going to cause, Rob?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well can't you see there's cake mix on the table – the cake won't be ready in time – and it'll taste disgusting with all that salt in it.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh calm down – do you want to taste the cake mix?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh go on then…. Mmmm, actually it's not too bad. And there's not much mess. Perhaps it's not a disaster – but maybe we shouldn't give it to Helen. Shall we keep it for later?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ha ha – it looks like this has been a recipe for success!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>For once Feifei, you might be right! Bye!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Hello and welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Feifei…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />… and hello I'm Rob. So what's this I hear about your new business idea Feifei?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Yes, I'm going to make and sell cakes.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Hmm, are you sure Feifei?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Yes I'm sure. Look I've already made this batch of muffins.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Err, are they supposed to be black? Cooking isn't really your speciality is it?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Cooking isn't my speciality! Rob, just you watch, I'm going to be a millionaire selling my homemade cakes.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />I'm sorry to say Feifei but I think you're going to fall at the first hurdle.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Don't be stupid Rob, I'm not going to be jumping any hurdles – we're not talking about sport – just cooking.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />No Feifei – I mean you're going to fail right at the start of what you're trying to do.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Thanks Rob! So you think by cooking these 'black' muffins means I have already failed?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Well they are burnt. Let's hear some examples of other people who have fallen at the first hurdle….</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />Plans to construct a new motorway will fall at the first hurdle if they can't buy the farmland to build it on.</p> 
<p>His dream of marrying Julie fell at the first hurdle when he discovered she was already married.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />'To fall at the first hurdle' means to fail near the beginning of something. Ah but Rob, why don't you actually taste one of these muffins before you call me a failure?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />OK here goes. Mmm, actually, not bad Feifei. They're not burnt…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />… no, it's actually a layer of crunchy toffee. I can cook Rob!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />OK, I'm sorry for doubting you… but you're going to have to sell lots of muffins if you want to be a millionaire.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />I know. Perhaps I'll just sell these ones first and see how I get on.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Good idea. Just make sure you don't fall at the final hurdle!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />You mean fail near the end of what I'm trying to do?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Exactly.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />I won't – as long as you don't keep eating my cakes. Hands off!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Sorry!</p> 
<p><strong>Both</strong><br />Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Rob, and joining me is Feifei.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello. (sneezes)</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Bless you!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>(sneezes)</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Are you ok? Have you got a cold?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>No, not a cold. Something's making me sneeze. Errr... Rob, is that a cat on your lap?!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes. Meet Tiddles. I decided to bring him to the office because he gets lonely at home on his own… don't you Tiddley-widdly? It's a good idea, don't you think? Feifei? You've gone all quiet – you've usually got something to say. Feifei?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>(sneezes)</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Can you speak? Cat got your tongue?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>No! Your cat has not got my tongue – or anything else – I'm allergic to cats.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh dear Feifei - but saying 'cat got your tongue?' means 'you're very quiet' or 'you've got nothing to say'.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Really?! Well let's hear some examples of this phrase…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>What's the matter? Cat got your tongue? I did say we'd use up all our money on the car!</p> 
<p>A: Has the cat got your tongue? You usually go on about how amazing your boyfriend is.<br />B: We split up.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So 'cat got your tongue?' is an informal question you might say to someone who isn't saying much. [sneezes]</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh I get it now. You weren't saying much because you were too busy sneezing!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>No Rob. I was angry because you know I am allergic to cats – don't you remember me saying that I can't be in the same room as one? Rob? Rob! What's wrong? Cat got your tongue now?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>It appears Tiddles needed the toilet… but it's too late now. I'm all wet!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh Rob. You stink! I'm off. Bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Rob.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Hello everyone. I’m Feifei. Rob, I have a question about a saying that I heard recently. Can we talk about it in this programme?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Yes, sure – what is it?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Well, last night I was in the pub with some friends, it was getting late and they were starting to drink shots of liquor; one of my friends was encouraging me to give it go and he said “Drink it, it’ll put hairs on your chest!” What did he mean? Why would liquor put hairs on my chest? I do not want hairs on my chest!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Haha, I’m sure you don’t but that’s very funny, Feifei. ‘It’ll put hairs on your chest’ in that context means it’s good for you, it’ll make you a strong man or a woman!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />To have hairs on my chest means I’m a strong person? What a strange expression!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Yeah, I suppose it is a little strange. Traditionally, we say ‘that’ll put hairs on your chest’ to someone when they are about to have a very strong alcoholic drink or a very satisfying hearty meal. It is used in a humorous way.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Ah, that’s what it means. I was so confused last night. Can we use this saying in any other context?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Yes, we can. These days we can use this saying in many contexts. For example, we can use it to mean something that will make you healthy, strong and tough.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Can we hear some examples, please?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Of course.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />Have another drink! It’ll put hairs on your chest.</p> 
<p>Why don’t you try the spicy fish dish? That’ll put hairs on your chest.</p> 
<p>I was told eating dates everyday would put hairs on my chest.</p> 
<p>Have some more green vegetables – they’ll put hairs on your chest.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />So we can use ‘it'll put hairs on your chest’ to mean something that is good for you and makes you strong.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Yes. So Feifei, would you like to try some sloe gin that I’ve made for Christmas?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Sloe gin? Mmm, I will only have some sloe gin if it doesn’t put hairs on my chest.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Haha, I am sure it will…here you are…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Thanks! See you next time.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Bye</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>"
"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Hi you are listening to The English We Speak. I am Li and with me today is Finn. Hi Finn.</p> 
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><em>(Finn is suffering from a bad toothache)</em>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Hello everyone…</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Oh dear, your face is a bit swollen. What's the matter?</p> 
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>I've got this bad toothache again! Blame my mother for giving me a sweet tooth, Li.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Yes you are very sweet and you always bring us nice chocolates and sweets. But why should you blame your mother for this great quality – your kindness?</p> 
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Oh that's very sweet of you Li, but the phrase to have 'a sweet tooth' is another way of saying that someone craves sweet food all the time, such as sweets, desserts and chocolates.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>I see. So when you say someone has a sweet tooth you mean this person likes sweet-tasting food, such as sweets, chocolates and desserts. &nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Oh that's right, yes. Have you noticed that I take five sugars in my tea? I usually have six or seven cups of tea every day!</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>That sounds like you do have a sweet tooth! Let's hear some examples of how this expression is used:</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>John always has a bag of sweets open on his desk. He's got such a sweet tooth.</p> 
<p>I wish I didn't have a sweet tooth, because I had four rotten teeth pulled out and eight filled when I was only twenty.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>You know what Finn, don't blame your mother. Blame the 'sweet' culture of Britain. I think that this country makes the best desserts in the world!</p> 
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Really Li? Well it is difficult to resist the temptation of the yummy cakes you see in the shops!</p> 
<p><strong>Li </strong>So, seeing as you've got such bad toothache, perhaps I could help you with the delicious cheesecake you have with you in the studio…</p> 
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Oh… you are cheeky, aren't you, Li?</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>I will buy you one back when your toothache is gone, I promise.</p> 
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>That's a deal!</p> 
<p><strong>Li and Finn<br /></strong>Bye&nbsp;</p>"
"<p><em>(Feifei finds Finn in the company canteen)</em></p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi Finn. What are you doing here sitting alone in the canteen? Can I sit with you?</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure. Take a seat, Feifei.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mind if I take a chip? They look good.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh yeah, go ahead! I'm just eating this quickly as I'm going out soon, you know? I'm going to take a look at a car. It's a sports car! I've always wanted one.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A sports car? Sounds expensive. How can you afford a sports car?</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, it's a second-hand car. The owner needs to sell it quickly so they're selling it really cheaply. What a great opportunity, huh?!</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These sports cars burn a lot of fuel, you know, Finn. The <em>car</em> might come cheap but do you want to end up keeping it in a garage?</p>
<p><strong>Finn &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>Well, I hadn't thought of that…</p>
<p><strong>Feifei </strong></p>
<p>And there's also insurance. A car like that will attract thieves, so it'll cost a lot…</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's right. You know… you've just given me some food for thought…</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Food? You want more food? I thought you wanted to finish eating quickly?</p>
<p><strong>Finn &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>I'm not talking about real food. In English, when you say 'food for thought' you mean serious ideas or topics for us to think about.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p>
<p>Nothing to do with chips, then?</p>
<p><strong>Finn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>No food involved. 'Food for thought' is today's expression in The English We Speak. Let's hear some examples of how it's used.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<p><em>The football coach was really disappointed when his team lost 3-0 to an amateur side. But it gave him food for thought.</em></p>
<p><em>Mary's divorce gave her food for thought. She decided to go back to university, get a diploma, and change her life around.</em></p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So Finn, are you going to buy this sports car? &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not so sure now. You have indeed given me food for thought.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(<em>Chewing</em>)… Mmmm… these are good…</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My chips! Feifei, you've taken all my chips?!</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry Finn. They looked so good and I thought you were in a rush.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was, until you gave me… food for thought!</p>
<p><strong>Feifei </strong></p>
<p>Ok – let me get another plate. Chips are much better than sports cars anyway. Let's just focus on the eating today.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah, and let's do the thinking another day! Bye.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>Bye.</p>

"<p><strong>Feifei</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi Finn. What's that you're reading?</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, it's just a really interesting article about a man who made a fortune by selling shoes, Feifei. You know, he's a billionaire!</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>A billionaire?! I guess the shoes must be very expensive – for the upper classes…</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Well. No, not at all. The shoes are just for Joe Bloggs.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joe Bloggs? He made all that money, making shoes for just one man?</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>No. What I mean is, the man made a fortune selling shoes for the average person. In English, when we want to refer to the average person we can use the name 'Joe Bloggs'.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ah, I see. So, Joe Bloggs could be any one of us.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>That's right. Any Tom, Dick or Harry.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Oh! Who are they?<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finn &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This is another expression we use when we want to talk about lots of people in general; nobody in particular: Tom, Dick or Harry.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Ah. I see... They're short, common names. Thank you for the explanation, Finn. You know, I love reading these American news websites… Oh! Finn! Tragedy in Miami!</p>
<p><strong>Finn &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Really? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's here in this article… a policeman said he found the body of John Doe in a popular nightclub. He was stabbed! Poor Doe family!</p>
<p><strong>Finn &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Feifei, this is sad news, especially for this man's family. But they are probably not called Doe. They're not the Doe family.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Why not? Do you know them?</p>
<p><strong>Finn &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Well, in American English, John Doe is a name often used when referring to the victim of a crime whose body hasn't been identified. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Ah! I've heard this name before… in crime TV shows.</p>
<p><strong>Finn &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Yes. In the US they use John Doe when the victim is male and Jane Doe when the victim is female. Let's hear some examples of these expressions used in today's The English We Speak.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<p>A: Bright purple jacket? Sparkly blue skirt? Who wears such outrageous clothes?</p>
<p>B: Well, this fashion designer is popular among the very trendy. These clothes are not for Joe Bloggs!</p>
<p>Listen, this is a very exclusive party I'm inviting you to. Don't go around talking about it or every Tom, Dick and Harry will end up there.</p>
<p>Detective: The John Doe found at the scene is in the morgue right now. We're waiting for the DNA test results to identify the body.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So Joe Bloggs; Tom, Dick and Harry; and John Doe and Jane Doe are not real people.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>What a crowd!</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>That's a very interesting lesson. Thank you, Finn.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>You're welcome, Feifei. Time to go. Bye!</p>
<p><strong>Feifei &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Bye!</p>"

<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Li. &nbsp;I've got a word connected to love to teach you today... But where's Finn? I'll call his mobile.</p> 
<p><em>(Phone ringing as Finn comes in breathless)</em></p> 
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Hi Li. Sorry I'm late. I just couldn't get away.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Oh! Finn, there you are. You couldn't get away, from what?</p> 
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>You know I gave a presentation at lunch time about our new Shakespeare series?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Yeah, but that finished over an hour ago.</p> 
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Yeah, yeah&nbsp;I know. But this woman from the marketing department kept asking me questions. You know, she said she loves Shakespeare.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Was anyone else there?</p> 
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>No, it was just the two of us. I tried to get away but she kept asking more and more questions.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Oh dear Finn, I think it might be you that she fancies, not Shakespeare.</p> 
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Oh, you think so? Oh, and actually, that is a good word to learn. If you fancy someone, you find them physically attractive.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Yes, that's a good definition. Let's hear some examples:</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Look at the figure-hugging clothes you're wearing, Betty. Is there someone you fancy at the party?</p> 
<p>He's a lovely guy. We're really good friends. Actually, I fancy him a little…</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>So if you fancy someone, you want to go out with them, don't you?</p> 
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Yes, you do. Actually, that woman at the Shakespeare presentation was very nice… You know, interesting, pretty…</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>It sounds like you fancy her as well, don't you, Finn?</p> 
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Well, I think she fancies me more. Look at this!</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Wow!&nbsp;Did she give you this box of chocolates?</p> 
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Yes, nice isn’t it?&nbsp;Do you fancy one?</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Of course! But let's say goodbye before we go.</p> 
<p><strong>Finn&nbsp;and Li<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><strong><br /> </strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei and joining me is Harry.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /> </strong>Hello! And the expression we are going to look at today which we hear a lot in colloquial speech is 'full-on'. So, Feifei - did you have a good weekend?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>It was quiet. I stayed home most of the time. I watched a couple of old, black and white films with my grandmother on Sunday. That was the highlight. How about you?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Well, your weekend sounds quite... relaxed. Well, my weekend wasn't like your weekend at all. I went to the launch party of a new bar on Friday - that was quite a night! Then on Saturday my friends took me to a night club that went on until morning!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Wow! That sounds exciting. Clubbing though - aren't you a bit old for that sort of thing?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>No, I'm not too old, but to be honest - it was a bit full-on.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Full-on? What do you mean?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Well, the music, the dancing, the drinking, the energy. It was very intense. I'm not old, but I'm not as young as I was.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Right. So full-on means it was very intense.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Yeah. I think I'll need a few days to recover; it was so full-on.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>What else can be full-on?</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Some people are a bit full-on. A bit extreme. Not relaxing.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I know what you mean. Sarah's a bit full-on isn't she?</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Yes, she scares me. She stands so close when she talks to me and stares straight into my eyes. Work can also be full-on when it's busy.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Work has been a bit full on lately hasn't it. We've had to do loads of overtime to get the new project finished.</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>It has been full-on, yes. Let's listen to some more examples.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong><strong><em>Man<br /></em></strong><em>Have a good holiday?</em></p> 
<p><strong><em>Woman</em></strong><em><br /> To be honest, not really. We were up at 6am every day to get as much sightseeing done as possible and didn't get to bed till midnight. It was so full-on. I feel like I need another holiday.</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p> 
<p><em>I really don't like children's parties. All those excited, screaming kids. It's too full-on.</em></p> 
<p><em>London's too full-on. I need to move to the countryside.</em></p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well, if you want a more relaxing weekend next time, come and watch some films with me and my grandmother. It's really laid back.</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>That sounds a lot less full-on. I'll do that.</p>

<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"

<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak! Harry with you here today, and joining me is Feifei.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello everybody! And the expression we are going to look at in this programme is 'stab in the back'. So Harry, how are you?</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>[Distracted] What? Oh, not bad. Well... no, fine. Nothing.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>What? You're not telling me something. What's the matter? Has something happened?</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>No, not really. I'm just annoyed with Jim. I don't really want to talk about it.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>But I thought you were friends.</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Well, we were friends, until I discovered he stabbed me in the back…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Stabbed you in the back?!</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Yes, exactly! He had a meeting with the boss, and right there, he stabbed me in the back! In front of everyone! I'm really annoyed.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>But, surely you're more than annoyed! I mean, if he stabbed you in the back – don't you need an ambulance at least? I mean, it's lucky he didn't kill you. What did he stab you with? A knife?</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Ah, no. He stabbed me in the back with his words. There was no actual violence.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>He stabbed you with words?</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Yes. To stab someone in the back means to betray someone. He knew that I wanted to handle the new video project, and he said he'd help me get it. But in the meeting he told the boss that I didn't have enough experience to do a project like that.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ah, so stab in the back means he did something bad to you even though you thought you were friends.</p> 
<p>Here are some more examples of 'stab in the back'.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>INSERT<br /></strong><em>A lot of young people think you have to stab people in the back to get ahead in business, but you don't.</em></p> 
<p><em>She told me she was in love with me, but then she stabbed me in the back and went out with Dave.</em></p> 
<p><em>I wouldn't trust Laura if I were you. She's nice to your face, but then she stabs you in the back.</em></p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So, you're not happy with Jim. But personally I'm just relieved. It could have been a lot worse. I mean, you're not actually hurt. Remember sticks and stones may break your bones but words will never hurt you.</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Well, that's an expression for another programme!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>You're right. Today's expression is to stab someone in the back. Not a very nice thing to do.</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Join us again soon on The English We Speak.</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei</strong><strong><br /> </strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei and joining me is Harry.</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Hello there! And the expression we are going to look at in this programme is 'wow factor'.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>We'll look at what it means and when you can use it. So anyway Harry, how's the flat hunting going?</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Oh, don't ask! Not very well, really. I mean, I've seen a few places so far, but they didn't really appeal to me.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So none of them were any good?</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>They were OK. Adequate I suppose. I could live in some of them if I had to, but none of them had the wow factor. Do you know what I mean?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Not really. The wow factor? What is that?</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>The wow factor? Something that makes you go 'wow' when you walk in. 'Wow' is something we say in English when we're surprised. So, you know, a sun deck, a view of Big Ben, a steam room, a granite cocktail bar, a shared swimming pool – that kind of thing. My friend who teaches English in Indonesia has his own swimming pool and I was hoping …</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, but this is London. It's quite hard to get any of those things unless you spend a lot of money. What else can have the wow factor?</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>You hear it a lot on TV. On cooking shows, when someone creates an exciting tasty dish they say it's really got the wow factor.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, I heard that. 'It's just an omelette, but the chillies give it a real wow factor'.</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>That's right. And in singing competitions, if the singer delivers an exciting performance, the judges say they really had the wow factor.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So, you can apply it to anything or anyone that is surprisingly good or impressive?</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>That's right. Let's listen to some more examples.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong><em>He's just bought a new Italian sports car – it's really got the wow factor.</em></p> 
<p><em>We're going to completely re-decorate the restaurant so there's more of a wow factor when you walk in.</em></p> 
<p><em>Your CV looks OK. Your work experience is solid, but there's no real wow factor that will impress employers.</em></p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So, do you think you'll find a place to live with the wow factor?</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>I'm not sure. But if I don't, I might spend my money on a 72-inch 3D TV. That way people will still get the wow factor when they walk in.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>That would certainly have the wow factor, and I want to come round and watch some cookery shows and singing competitions.</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>No problem! &nbsp;Join us again soon for The English We Speak.</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Helen and joining me today is Rob.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Hello. Hey, have you heard Neil's good news?</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />No, what's that?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Well, he ran in the London Marathon and he came first!</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />That's impossible.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Well I know it's hard to believe but he has been training very hard and he's quite a fast runner.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Sorry Rob – he's lying through his teeth – he went to the cinema on Sunday!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Oh, did he really? Well, you've just used a perfect phrase – 'to lie through your teeth' – it means to tell someone something that's completely untrue.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />That's why I said it! So he's giving you false information.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Yes, I'm going to have words with him – but before I do, let's hear some more examples of this phrase…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />When she said she was nearly 30 years old, I knew she was lying through her teeth!</p> 
<p>They promised we'd get free drinks every day at our hotel but they were lying through their teeth.</p> 
<p>He lied through his teeth when he said he bought her an expensive engagement ring – it was just a cheap one from the catalogue.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />So, 'to lie through your teeth' means to say something that's false. Neil was telling an outrageous lie, I can't believe you fell for it.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Well actually, it was me who was lying through my teeth. Neil didn't tell me he'd won the marathon – it was a trick to find out where Neil really was on Sunday – and now you've told me – he was at the cinema on his own! Thanks very much.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Well, to be honest, he wasn't alone at the cinema – he went with me but we forgot to invite you. Sorry!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />You liar!</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />It was just a little white lie – a lie that's told just to avoid upsetting someone.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Well it hasn't worked. I'm off. Good bye!</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Oh dear, Rob.</p>"
"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Hello welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Helen.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello everyone. I'm Neil. It's great to be here today, Helen.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>You are very cheerful today.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>I feel pretty good, I walked from the train station to the office and it seems to have really energised me.</p> 
<p>(phone rings)</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>That's my phone. Hello, hello? Anyone there? Hello?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Oh, it looks like you may be out of juice.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>What? I am not drinking any juice, but my phone has just gone dead.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>That's what I mean. Your phone isn't working because it's out of juice.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Please explain: what's juice got to do with my phone?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>When you've used all the battery power of something like a mobile phone, so that it doesn't work anymore, we can say it's 'out of juice'. It's a slang expression. Have a listen to these examples:</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>My laptop's out of juice. This is so frustrating.</p> 
<p>I am packing three spare phone batteries so I don't run out of juice on my climbing trip.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>I see. Can we use it for anything else apart from batteries?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Sure, sometimes if a person feels low on energy, they could say 'I'm out of juice'. Also if your car is low on petrol, you could say 'The car's running out of juice.'</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Thanks for explaining this phrase. Now I'm feeling quite thirsty - a glass of juice would be most welcome.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Let's go and get some then. Meanwhile, charge your phone, so it's got plenty of juice.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Will do.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>See you next time.</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Good to see you, Rob. How was your holiday in sunny Spain?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>It was fantastic: the sun, the beach, the sea, the food and the people… It was perfect!How about you? Did you manage to get away for the weekend?</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>We had a good start to our weekend at the seaside, but it was just awful on the way back.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Oh dear, what happened?</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>We decided to drive down instead of getting the train.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Good idea. Well with a car you can explore the coast easily. But the train can be less stressful.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />The return journey was absolutely crazy. So many people going back to London after the weekend!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />So the traffic was bumper-to-bumper?</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Bumper-to-bumper? No we weren’t that close to the car in front. I know my Highway Code, at least a two-second gap between cars.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Well, I didn't mean it literally! When there is a lot of traffic on the road and it’s moving very slowly or not at all, the front of one car is almost touching the back of another one, so it’s bumper-to-bumper.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Oh I see. Well it was like that, we were not moving at all on one stretch of the motorway. A 90-minute journey in the end took us 5 hours.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh poor you! It’s so frustrating, isn’t it? The expression bumper-to-bumper is heard a lot in travel reports on the radio. Here are a couple of examples:</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Traffic on the northbound A12 near Greenwich Junction is bumper-to-bumper. Best to avoid the area if you can.</p> 
<p>The approach to the Dartford Tunnel southbound entrance is bumper-to-bumper. Expect severe delays.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Thanks for explaining this. So it was bumper-to-bumper for us all the way home.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />You got it. Maybe you will take the train next time?</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>I think I might. Or I might try to avoid the rush hour traffic.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Or you could stay at home.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Good advice Rob.</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Welcome to The English We Speak with me Rob - and today I've come round to Helen's house because she said she needed some help...&nbsp;<em>(Doorbell and door opens)&nbsp;</em></p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Oh hi Rob. Thanks for coming round. <em>(She shuts the door)</em></p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>That's OK, no problem. Now, how can I help?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>I need you to fix my toaster please. You know me, I love my toast but since yesterday, every time I try to make some, black smoke keeps coming out of it.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hmm, black smoke? That doesn't sound good. OK, let's have a look at it... Err, Helen?</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Yes?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>There's a sock in it - that's very dangerous - no wonder you're getting black smoke when you try to make toast! &nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Rob, I put the sock in there.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>You put the sock in there - why did you do that?</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Well, my friend came round for breakfast yesterday, and I was telling her all about my fantastic holiday... the great weather, the good food and the... handsome men...</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>So?</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Well, I was making us both toast when she said 'Helen, put a sock in it!'</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /> </strong>Ah! I don't think she actually meant put a sock in the toaster - when people say that, it means 'be quiet'!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br /> How rude! 'Put a sock in it' isn't a very polite thing to say Rob!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br /> It's not. It's an impolite way of saying 'stop talking'! It can also mean, keep the noise down. Your friend must have been annoyed by your non-stop chatter if she said that! Let's hear some more examples of this phrase in action...</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /> </strong>Put a sock in it! We're trying to do some work here!<br /> <br /> Oh, put a sock in it! I've already said I'm going to do the washing-up later.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My Dad was telling me how I should work harder at school so I told him to 'put a sock in it!'</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>So the phrase 'to put a sock in it' really means 'be quiet' or 'shut up'. But Rob, I don't talk that much, it's just I like to tell people about my holidays, my cooking, my boyfriends...</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Err, Helen...</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Yes?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Can you put a sock in it please?! In fact, use this... dirty sock from your toaster!</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>But where should I put it?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Well, figuratively speaking, the phrase means put a sock in your mouth to stop you talking - so try that!</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br /> Oh thanks. <em>(Toaster pops up)</em> Actually, now my toaster is working, I'm going to have socks on toast!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br /> <em>(Sniffing the sock)</em> Well, by the smell of this sock, it's going to be <em>cheese</em> on toast.</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Helen and joining me today is Neil.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello everyone.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Neil, guess who I met yesterday?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>No idea. Anyone I know?</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>The name is Jonathan Kendall - he said you guys worked together a long time ago.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Oh yes, we did. Gosh, it must have been nearly 15 years ago if my memory is right.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Wow, that is a long time ago.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So what's he doing now?</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>He works at Radio Melody. He's now the station manager.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Is he still there? Wow, he really is part of the furniture.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>What do you mean 'he's part of the furniture'? He is a person, not a sofa or a table.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Oh, I don't mean it literally. It's an expression we use to describe someone or something that's been in the same place for a very long time. You almost that think they'll be there forever. Let's listen to a few examples.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>John has been the school caretaker for nearly twenty years. He's become part of the furniture.</p> 
<p>We come here so often, it's almost as if we are part of the furniture.</p> 
<p>She's had a seat in parliament for over 50 years – she's part of the furniture in the House of Commons.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Right, I've got it. So how long have you been at the BBC?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>I've lost count. Let me see, I left school at 18, did an apprenticeship for 2 years and then I joined the BBC in 1995.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>That's twenty years. My goodness! So you are part of the furniture at the BBC!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes, you are absolutely right. Where have all the years gone?</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Will you be here for the next twenty years?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Who knows? Let's wait and see.</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Neil.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Hello everyone. I’m Helen.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Oh what’s the matter, Helen? You look really tired.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Is it that bad? </p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>You've got very dark shadows under your eyes.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Oh dear. Well, I’ve been pushed into a role and I don’t really want it. </p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>What is it?</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>To be the treasurer for the school’s parents association and you know I am hopeless with numbers.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Sounds like it could turn into a hot potato for you.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Hot potato? Do you mean a jacket potato? No I am not hungry, I am nervous. </p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>I'm not talking about food. I am talking about this job. I can see it’s going to be a problem for you.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>I’m thinking the same. </p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>You need to think about it very carefully before it becomes a hot potato. When something becomes a ‘hot potato’, it becomes a problem and difficult to handle.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>I see. You can’t hold a hot potato in your hand. It would burn you. </p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Exactly, you’ve got it. A hot potato is a phrase we use to refer to difficult or tricky situations, or even people. Here are a few examples: </p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>The shortage of housing supply is fast becoming a hot potato for the council.</p> 
<p>The pay rise issue is a hot potato for management; I don't know how they are going to sort this one out between the staff, the union and the shareholders. &nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Helen, my word of advice is…</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Please, I’m listening. </p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Just tell the school you can’t do it. Drop it before it becomes a real hot potato for you. </p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>You are right. That’s what I will do. Thanks</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>You’re welcome.</p>"
"<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Finn.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Hello everyone. I'm Helen.</p> 
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br />You look a bit different today.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Oh, really? In what way?</p> 
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br />Erm, you are glowing, you look so energised.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Really, I'm so flattered. I was invited to this amazing place on a tiny island by my friend.</p> 
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br />Oh wow, so you were away for the weekend?</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Oh yes. It's the best holiday I've had in years.</p> 
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br />It sounds great. What was it like?</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Sun, sea, just beautiful and tranquil.</p> 
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br />Was it expensive?</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />It wasn't. It was actually about &pound;200 pounds for both of us including flights. You should think about going.</p> 
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br />Wow, you know, you've sold it to me.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Em, but I don't sell holidays. I just make English learning programmes.</p> 
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br />No, what I mean is that I want to go. 'You've sold it to me' is a very colloquial way of saying 'you've convinced me'. Here are some examples.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />A: I lost five pounds after just a week on this new diet. It's definitely worth a try.<br />B: You've sold it to me. I need to get in shape for my school reunion.</p> 
<p>A: Your phone looks amazing.<br />B: It's brilliant, does everything, fab photos and great apps. AND it only cost me 10 pounds.<br />A: 10 pounds. You've sold it to me. Where can I get one today?</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />If you're serious about going, you'd better hurry. I think the special offer ends today at noon.</p> 
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br />What, I can't believe it. It's just past noon!</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Oh no, I'm sorry. I'm sure there'll be another chance later.</p> 
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br />Just my luck!</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Hello, welcome to another edition of The English We Speak. I’m Neil.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Hi, everyone. I’m Helen.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Helen, what are you doing Helen? Are you looking for something?</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Yes, I am. I’m looking for my earring; it’s a present from my mum.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Oh. When did you last see it?</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />A minute ago. I looked in the mirror before I came in to the studio. I’m sure I was wearing it.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Em, I’ll help you look under the table for it. But I don’t think you’ll find it by turning the place upside down. Be calm. Let’s leave the chairs on the floor.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />I’m not turning the chairs upside down, they are too heavy. I just want to check underneath them.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />When I say ‘turn the place upside down’, what I mean is you are making the studio very messy.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />I am sorry. Ugh, I found it. It’s under the desk.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Phew, what a relief. I don’t think we’d be allowed back in the studio if we literally turned the studio upside down.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />So to ‘turn something upside down’ means to make the place really messy because you’re trying to search thoroughly for something. Here are some examples.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />I turned my house upside down and I still couldn't find my car keys.</p> 
<p>I don’t care if you have to turn the place upside down. You’ve got to find my wedding ring.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Well, let’s tidy up before the studio managers come back and turn our lives upside down.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Let’s do that!</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Hello and welcome to The English We Speak from BBC Learning English, I’m Neil.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />And I’m Helen.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Helen, you look upset, what's the matter? Have I done something wrong?</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Oh, it’s not you. It’s my mobile phone company. I stopped my contract three months ago and they are still taking money out of my bank account. And it’s impossible to get through to customer service.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Oh, no, I know what you mean. These mobile phone companies are a nightmare to deal with. They are a real pain in the neck.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Pain in your neck? Are you OK? You don’t look so comfortable sitting in that chair? Is your neck hurting you?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />I’m alright. My neck is a bit stiff but ok. When people say pain in the neck, it means something or someone is annoying, actually very annoying for a long time. Here are a few more examples:</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />Sam is so disruptive in the class, he’s a pain in the neck to deal with.</p> 
<p>Completing this tax form is a real pain in the neck, there are so many boxes to fill in.</p> 
<p>The telesales people are a real pain in the neck, they keep ringing me.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Well, I am really really really annoyed by this mobile phone company. They are a real pain in the neck to deal with.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />My suggestion is that if they are still taking money out of your account, threaten them with legal action Helen.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />I will do that. Thanks for the tip.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />You’re welcome.</p>

"<p><strong>Neil &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Neil.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Hello everyone. I'm Helen.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>I saw you looking at a travel magazine earlier. Are you thinking about a holiday?</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Yes, I have actually booked a holiday in the Amazon rainforest.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Really, that sounds amazing. When are you going?</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>In a month's time, I'm really looking forward to it. Have you been there?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>No to the rainforest, but I've visited Brazil with my friends. It's a beautiful country. Can you speak Portuguese?</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>No, not at all. I was hoping English is enough.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Erm, if you are visiting the big cities, you can get by with English. But out of the cities, it's good to know a bit of Portuguese and about the local culture.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Oh dear, I am hopeless with languages. They are so difficult to master and take years to learn. I don't have years. I’ve got weeks to sort out my adventure.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Don't worry, you can go on a crash course.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>What course?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>A language crash course! When you are on a crash course, you learn about something in a very short period of time.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>But will it work for me?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well, that depends on your learning ability. I think you'd master the basics without any trouble. Here are a few more examples of crash courses on offer:</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Peter applied to train as a teacher, but he had to complete a compulsory crash course in maths first.</p> 
<p>Alison did a crash course in French before her trip to Paris.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I booked Nathan on a video editing crash course, so we've got at least one person who can operate the camera.</p> 
<p>Julie took a crash course in cooking to prepare for her wedding.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Can you recommend a Portuguese crash course for me?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Just have a look online, there are loads of them and some of them are free.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Perfect! Thanks Neil!<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>"

<p><strong>Helen<br /> </strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Helen.<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><strong><br /> </strong>And I'm Rob. Hello! Err, Helen are you feeling OK? You're looking a bit tired.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong> <br /> I am. I haven't been sleeping very well. I have so much revising to do for my exams.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I'm sure you'll be fine.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />I don't know. I've got assignments to write, exams to take – and look at my house, it's a mess, I've got to tidy up.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh calm down. Anyway, when are your exams?</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br /> In three months' time!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Three months?! That's ages. Helen, you need to take a chill pill!</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong> <br /> A chill pill? Oh right, let's have a look <em>(she looks through her box of medicines)</em>... paracetamol... aspirin... no - I haven't got any chill pills.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>You won't find them in there Helen. Chill pills aren't real. When you tell someone to take a chill pill, you are telling them to calm down and relax.&nbsp; So Helen... relax... chill!</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong> <br /> Oh right, thanks. So the doctor isn't going to give me one?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well, I'm sure he could give you something to help you relax but this idiom is just a saying to give someone some friendly advice, as you can hear in these examples...</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p> 
<p>Stop shouting at the referee and take a chill pill.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>She was getting so stressed about what her boss said to her that I told her to just take a chill pill – everything would be fine.</p> 
<p>My wife's working so hard, she needs to take a chill pill, otherwise she'll make herself ill.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong> <br /> OK, so we know to take a chill pill really means to relax or calm down. You're right Rob, I will take a chill pill and I will chill out...</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>That's good to hear.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong> <br /> Yes, in fact, I think I'll go shopping, get my hair done, maybe book a holiday... there's no point worrying about some silly exams is there? See you later Rob.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hold on Helen. I think perhaps you've taken too many chill pills?! I mean, these are quite important exams and you need good grades if you want to get a better job...</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong> <br /> Oh relax Rob... you know what you need to take?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>A chill pill?</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong> <br /> You said it!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello, and welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Neil and joining me in the studio today is Helen.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Hello everyone. It's nice to relax a bit. It's been a crazy few weeks. We had just four weeks to buy our new home.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Oh no, four weeks! That's really not much time.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>I know. Luckily the lawyers were very helpful. We got the mortgage in time and we completed the purchase last weekend.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So you've finally got your own place.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Yes, the money has exchanged hands and we got our keys yesterday!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Brilliant, so it's all done and dusted then.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>No, we haven't had the chance to inspect the house yet. Never mind dusting it.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>I wasn't talking about dusting the house!</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>But I heard you ask if it was done and dusted.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Oh, it's just a way of saying everything is OK now - nothing else needs doing. You've closed the deal on your house purchase. It's done and dusted.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>So the phrase done and dusted means work on something is completely finished. When I heard you say dust, I thought you were asking me if I had cleaned the house. No way, I only got the keys yesterday! I haven't even set foot in the house yet.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Done and dusted is actually a very common expression. We hear it a lot at work. And usually it means something has been completed successfully, there's no more work to be done on it. Let's hear some examples.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong></p> 
<p><em>The dispute between me and the council about my parking ticket has been resolved. It's done and dusted.</em></p> 
<p><em>After two months of hard work, the project is finally done and dusted.</em></p> 
<p><em>About this logo design... as far as I'm concerned, it's done and dusted.&nbsp;</em></p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Done and dusted is a popular casual expression, it's used to talk about something that's finished successfully.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>That's right. And this programme is now done and dusted.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Thanks for listening. Join us next time for more useful English expressions.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Bye. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei and joining me today is Rob.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Hi everyone… errr, Feifei are you OK? You don't sound as cheerful as normal.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />I feel terrible today – I've got a headache, feel really tired… I think I'm developing flu. I'm going to take these paracetamol tablets.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Hold on Feifei. Are you sure you're getting flu? This hasn't got anything to do with that job promotion you didn't get?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Of course not… well maybe a little.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Hmm, I know you wanted that promotion so much but Daisy got it instead didn't she?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Exactly – and I've been working here much longer than her and I have loads more experience. It's so unfair!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />I know… it's a bitter pill to swallow.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Thanks for the advice but even if these tablets – or pills - are bitter, they'll make me feel better – now can you show me some more sympathy about my promotion please?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />I was Feifei! When I said 'it's a bitter pill to swallow' I really meant it's a situation that is unpleasant and difficult to accept.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />OK, I see! You're saying I'm finding Daisy's promotion hard to accept?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />It's tough Feifei but that's the way things are. Let's hear some more examples of this phrase in action…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />When John found out about his wife's affair with his best friend, it was a bitter pill to swallow.</p> 
<p>It was a bitter pill to swallow knowing that my older sister finished the race quicker than me.</p> 
<p>My friend has booked the same flights as me for half the price – it's a bitter pill to swallow!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />So 'a bitter pill to swallow' means I don't like what's happened but I will have to accept it? Hmm, I like the phrase but it doesn't make me feel any better.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />You'll just have to swallow the decision Feifei! Daisy is going to be your boss now.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Oh dear… I think my flu might be getting worse now… I'm definitely going to take these paracetamol now… Yuk, that really was bitter!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />I think two tablets are enough for now Feifei. Maybe you should take tomorrow off work.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />What a great idea Rob. See you later.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong><em>(Makes sound of a duck)</em></p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Welcome to The English We Speak…</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong><em>(Makes sound of a duck)</em></p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Shh… Let me finish! Welcome to The English We Speak, the programme where we…</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong><em>(Makes sound of a duck)</em></p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ok, ok – you win, Neil. You start the programme.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>OK – welcome to The English We Speak. Today we bring you a way to say hello to people that involves… ducks.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Finally. English is, of course, a rich and diverse language, and different regions use different expressions. In the English Midlands – the area around the city of Nottingham - you'll hear this. Imagine I'm in a shop, and Neil is the shopkeeper:</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello duck, how can I help you?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello duck – 'duck' here is a form of address – a word you use when politely speaking to someone.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>And 'duck' is an affectionate term for another person. So if you hear it – please don't be offended – it's a friendly thing to say.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Some think that it comes from the word 'duke'! Let's hear a few examples:</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Come over here and tell me what the problem is, duck.</p> 
<p>Don't you worry about that broken glass, duck. I'll sort it out.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>'Duck' is generally used by people talking to those younger than or the same age as themselves. In some ways it functions like the word ‘dear'.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>But it's not a phrase that all native English speakers use. When Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie used it when presenting an award to an English actor from the East Midlands, Jack O'Connoll, it confused a lot of people around the world!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>And what's more, 'duck' is not the only form of address based on animals. For example, where might someone call you… hen?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>'Hen' is used in Glasgow – but only when talking to women.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Alright hen? And then we have 'pet'…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>'Pet' is used in the North East of England – around Newcastle people call each other 'pet'.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Thanks, pet. So – listen out for these different regional ways of being friendly – just don't be surprised if you confuse people when you use them yourself! Thanks for listening.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong><em>(Makes sound of a duck)</em></p>"
"<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Hello, I'm Neil…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />… and I'm Feifei and this is The English We Speak.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Today I thought I'd impress you with an old Chinese phrase that we use in English now.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Oh yes – go on then, Impress me!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />The phrase is jiggery-pokery.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Jiggery-pokery! Oh come on, that's not Chinese!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />It is – everyone in China uses it – apparently.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />I don't think so. What does it mean anyway?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Jiggery-pokery refers to dishonest behaviour that is intended to trick people.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Oh hold on… were you trying to trick me just to illustrate this phrase?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Yes! I almost tricked you, didn't I?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Hmmm. I think we had better hear some better examples of this phrase in action.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />The company is being investigated after some shareholders accused it of jiggery-pokery.</p> 
<p>I was surprised that the businessman got away with so much jiggery-pokery before he was finally caught and sent to prison.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />That's 'jiggery-pokery', which describes dishonest or secret behaviour – but it is definitely not a Chinese phrase, Neil!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />OK, I know. Now before I forget, don't you owe me ten pounds?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />No! I bought you lunch remember. Honestly, jiggery-pokery in action!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Well at least you won't forget the phrase now.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />True. Bye.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Hello and welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Feifei…</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />And hello I'm Neil.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Hey Neil, I couldn't help overhearing just now but Rob say he'd bought a new sports car?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Yes, a red one with one of those tops that folds back.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />It must have cost him a fortune!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Oh you know Rob – he spends money left, right and centre.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />You mean he spends it in all directions?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />That's right.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />So he spends money in Oxford Street – to the left. Bond Street – to the right. And sometimes at Oxford Circus – in the centre?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />I didn't mean physically on the left, right, and centre. It's a phrase that just means everywhere or all the time.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Ah got it. I suppose left, right, and centre is everywhere – in all directions.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />That's correct– and there are examples left, right, and centre – such as these…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />I'm not surprised the cafe closed. It's been losing customers left and right over the past couple of years.</p> 
<p>You can't miss that new film; they've been promoting it left, right, and centre.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />That's left, right, and centre – a phrase to mean everywhere or all the time. So how does Rob afford a new sports car?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Well our boss has been handing out bonuses left, right, and centre – he must have got a big one!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />The bonuses aren't that big. It's the bank – they're happy to give out loans left, right, and centre!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />I think you may be right – anyway the good thing is he'll take us for a drive in his new car. And here he comes now…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Hi there. Jump in!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil/ Feifei</strong><br />Bye for now.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello I'm Feifei and this is The English We Speak.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes, it is. And hello, I'm Rob.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I don't know about you Rob, but I seem to have so much work to do at the moment.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yeah, me too. We've got to meet that deadline by Friday.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I guess we've all got lots to do – and that's why I was surprised that Phyllis has asked to take three days off work this week.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Three days? Are you sure? Maybe she's unwell?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>No, she's fine – I heard her say to the boss in a very loud voice 'I've got a great deal on a flight to Italy so I need to take the rest of the week off.'</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>What cheek – she's got a <strong>brass neck</strong>.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>A <strong>brass neck</strong>? Phyllis has a <strong>brass neck</strong>! Really – when did she get that – maybe she needs a holiday to recover from the operation?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No no no Feifei. Her neck isn't actually made of brass – I just mean she is confident but also a bit rude – she can do or say things that most of us would be too embarrassed to do or say.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, she just doesn't care what she says does she? So if someone is described as having a <strong>brass neck</strong>, it means they are confident and say or do what they want but doesn't understand their behaviour might be unacceptable to others.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes, she certainly doesn't worry about what other people think of her. A bit like people in these examples…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>My ex-boyfriend's got a <strong>brass neck</strong>, coming round and asking me to do his washing!</p> 
<p>The customer has a <strong>brass neck</strong> asking for a refund when it was obvious he had already worn the shoes.</p> 
<p>She's got a&nbsp;<strong>brass neck</strong> telling the boss that he wasn't very good at his job – I would never say that!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So having a <strong>brass neck</strong> means you are extremely confident about your own actions but you don't understand that your behaviour might be unacceptable to others. So it's not like us Rob?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Absolutely not. Although, I was wondering if you wouldn't mind writing the notes for the presentation we're doing? I've got to meet someone for lunch.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ermm….</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Come on Feifei, you love writing presentations…. Oh why are you looking so brassed off?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Brassed off – you mean I'm looking annoyed and disappointed – maybe I'm looking brassed off because of your <strong>brass neck</strong>.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I'll take that as 'no' then. Oh well, at least you understand this English expression now!</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei…</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>… and… hi there… I'm Neil.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Err… Neil, could we have your attention please?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Sorry Feifei – I'm still trying to finish the script for this programme.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>What? You're still writing the script for this programme! So what's going to happen today then?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well, I thought that you could pretend to arrive late… I've lost my coffee… I just need to think of an authentic real English phrase to use now…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh come on Neil, there is no need to reinvent the wheel!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Feifei, you're amazing – <strong>to reinvent the wheel</strong> – that's a great English phrase. I'll use that in my script.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br />To reinvent the wheel</strong> means 'to waste time trying to create something that has already been made'. So I'm saying, don't waste time writing a script that has already been written – all your ideas have been written before!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Really?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I'll show you – but first let's hear some more examples of this phrase…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Don't reinvent the wheel; we already have a plan that seems to work well.</p> 
<p>He spent days working out the new course syllabus when we had planned it already – he's just reinvented the wheel!</p> 
<p>Nancy's new idea is just the same as the old one – she's just reinvented the wheel!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So <strong>to reinvent the wheel</strong> means 'to waste time and effort doing something that someone has done before'. Now let me show you that old script…</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Oh yeah. Let's have a look. Arrives late… drinks coffee… I tell a joke… you're right Feifei, this is almost the same script. I'll just copy the idea for today's script.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Actually, maybe you shouldn't reinvent the wheel - and start writing something new and original.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Sorry - we're out of time Feifei. I just need to say something funny and we can go… I've had a 'wheely' good time!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>That wasn't funny.</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Neil and joining me is Feifei…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hi there everyone.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> In this programme we have an expression you can use when someone has almost succeeded – but not quite. Now Feifei, could you just pass me that lighter, please?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Lighter? What on earth are you doing with that cigar? You can't smoke in here!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> It's a clue. You have to guess what the expression is.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Oh OK. Is it 'to smoke like a chimney?'</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Close, but no cigar.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> OK, is it 'no smoke without fire'?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Close, but no cigar.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Oh, I give up!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> I've told you twice already – it's 'close, but no cigar.' If someone almost succeeds – but not quite – you can say to them 'close, but no cigar.' Here are some examples.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>A: How old do you think I am?</p> 
<p>B: 36?&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A: Nope – 35. Close, but no cigar.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Five of my numbers came up in the lottery. Close, but no cigar.</p> 
<p>They hit the post in the last second of the game. Close, but no cigar!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So, there we go. If someone almost succeeds, but doesn't quite, we can say to them 'close, but no cigar.'</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Right, well you can put that cigar away now we've finished.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Actually, it's a really good one – shame to waste it.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Neil!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Uh oh!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>"
"<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hello, I'm Rob…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>…and I'm Feifei and this is The English We Speak.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Feifei, you've travelled all over the world but have you ever been to la-la land?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ha – you mean Los Angeles – the city of angels. It's an amazing place, full of film stars!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Sounds great and you're very clever – la-la land is the informal name for Los Angeles… but there is another la-la land.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>And where is this other la-la land?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>It's usually in someone's head! Like our boss – he wants me to write all these scripts, edit them and make him a cup of tea – by the end of the day. He really is living in la-la land!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Our boss is living in la-la land – but the last time I checked he was living in London!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well Feifei, if someone is living in la-la land it can also mean they are in a fantasy world where they believe impossible things might happen – but they are being unreasonable and not being realistic.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Just like our boss.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Someone in la-la land doesn't really understand how things really are – take a listen to these examples…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>She's clearly living in la-la land – how can we ever afford to buy a house with the little money we earn?</p> 
<p>My boyfriend's living in la-la land if he thinks I'm going sailing with him – I get seasick!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>That's la-la land – a phrase to describe someone who is unreasonable or out of touch with reality. I know the feeling – I've got lots of work to do too and I'm going on holiday tomorrow… I don't suppose you could help me?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Feifei you really are living in la-la land – I've told you I haven't got any time.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ah well, I just thought I'd ask.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Anyway, where are you off on holiday to this time?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Can't you guess?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br /> La-la land?</p> 
<p><strong>Both</strong><br />Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei</strong><strong><br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei and joining me is Harry.</p> 
<p><strong>Harry</strong><strong><br /></strong>Hello there! And the expression we are going to look at in this programme is 'mind-blowing', or, 'to blow your mind'.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong></p> 
<p>To blow your mind! We'll look at what it means and when you can use it. So anyway, Harry, I've heard you really like travelling.</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Me? Yeah, I love travelling, to be free. Yeah, I've travelled.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Where have you been?</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>All over: Europe, South East Asia, North Africa, Central America.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So, which was the best trip?</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Hard to say, they were all great in their own way, but I think my trip to Cambodia really stands out.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Why's that?</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Well, it's got scenery, beaches, nice food and all that stuff, but the temples at Angkor Wat – well, they just blew my mind.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>They blew your mind?!</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Yeah, it's an amazing place. It's got incredible statues, roads, waterways all abandoned in the forest. Truly mind-blowing.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>But what does it mean - mind blowing; it blew your mind?</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Oh right. Well, when something is so incredible, so surprising that we stop and wonder about how amazing it is, we can say it's mind-blowing, or that it blew our minds, as though our brains have broken down because they are so overwhelmed.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I see. So what else can be mind-blowing?</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Anything amazing: a painting, a film, a story.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>And what about nature - the ocean, the planets, the insect world?</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Yes, the unexplored ocean depths, the size of the other planets, the huge number and variety of insects - those things are all totally mind-blowing if you stop and think about them.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Here are some more examples.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>The latest tablet computer has an incredible camera and loads of other mind-blowing features.</p> 
<p>One of the most mind-blowing things about the universe is the distance between the planets.</p> 
<p>The battle scenes in the film were amazing. They just blew my mind.</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>So, to finish off, I thought I'd give you a mind-blowing fact about space and the universe - Something that will really blow your mind.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>OK, let's hear it.</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Did you know that every hour, the universe expands by a billion miles in all directions?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>It gets bigger by one billion miles in all directions?! That is mind-blowing.</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>I know - just mind-blowing.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I've got a very different one for you about insects - cockroaches.</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Cockroaches? Yuck! What is it?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well, Cockroaches can live for several weeks without their heads.</p> 
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>They can live without their heads?! Well, that's just blown my mind. Join us again for more mind-blowing English on The English We Speak.</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p>(sound of coffee cup being put on a table)</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Thanks for the coffee, Neil. What a good idea to present The English We Speak from a coffee shop!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes, Li, it's good to get out of the studio - and anyway, I get the coffee for free here. &nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>You don't pay for it?! So why do you get it for free?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>(Sounding slightly vague) Contacts.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Err… contacts?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes, people I know. Don't tell anyone but my friend works here and… well… when the boss isn't around, he gives me the coffee for free.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>(loudly and surprised) He gives it to you for free?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Ssshhh! Keep your voice down. If he gets found out he'll get the sack – you know, lose his job. We need to keep a lid on it.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Keep a lid on it?! Why do we need to keep a lid on the coffee? Are we trying to hide it?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>No Li. When you say <em>keep a lid on something</em>, it means keep it secret – or keep it quiet about it…&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Oh I see.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>The phrase can also mean keep something strongly under control. Like your loud voice – control it and don't tell anyone! Keep a lid on it.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>We had better hear some examples while I drink my coffee... quietly!</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>We need to keep a lid on the company merger – if the newspapers get to hear about this, our share price will drop.</p> 
<p>Our baby is due in November but keep a lid on the news – we haven't told our parents yet.</p> 
<p>Please – keep a lid on your emotions – otherwise the waiter is going to ask us to leave!</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>So that is keeping a lid on something. (sips coffee) Mmm, this coffee does taste good but I don't like the idea that you got it for free – it's dishonest… I might have to tell someone about this dishonest behaviour.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Ah! You mean you're going 'to lift the lid' on what I'm doing – that means to tell someone about something bad – well, you can but you know what that will mean?</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>What's that?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>You'll be buying the coffee next time – and it's not cheap!</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Oh right – let's just keep it our little secret for now shall we?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>OK Li!</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Hello Li. What a nice handbag. Is it new?</p>
<p><strong>Li<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Thank you, Rob. Yes. I bought in a designer shop. It was very expensive but it doesn't matter. Soon I will be able to afford ten like this one!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /></strong>What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>Li<br clear=""none"" /></strong>This afternoon I'm going to meet a financial adviser. He has promised to make me rich!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /></strong>And how is he going to do that?</p>
<p><strong>Li<br clear=""none"" /></strong>He said there's this new company which is very high-tech and they are developing a car which uses only fresh air for fuel!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Air?!</p>
<p><strong>Li<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Yes. Isn't that brilliant?!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Li, do you know this guy very well?</p>
<p><strong>Li<br clear=""none"" /></strong>No. But he has also advised my neighbour to buy shares in this company.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Li, this guy is taking you and your neighbour for a ride!</p>
<p><strong>Li<br clear=""none"" /></strong>I hope so. A ride in this wonderful car powered by air…</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /></strong>No, no, no. I don't mean that. In English, when we say someone is 'taking you for a ride', we mean he is deceiving you. This company might not even exist – and I'm sure the car is just a fantasy…</p>
<p><strong>Li<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Oh! He's just after my money?!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /></strong>I'm afraid so. 'Take for a ride' is today's expression in The English We Speak. Here are some examples of how it's used.</p>
<p><strong>Examples<br clear=""none"" /><br clear=""none"" /></strong>That hotel took me for a ride. When I booked a room they said they'd give me a full cooked breakfast but all I got was a cup of coffee and a piece of toast. I'm never going back there again.</p>
<p>Don't be taken for a ride. If an offer seems too good to be true, it's probably not real.</p>
<p><strong>Li<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Oh, Rob. Thank you very much for warning me.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /></strong>You're welcome, Li.</p>
<p><strong>Li<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Well, talking about rides… when you say it as a normal sentence, the phrase 'take someone for a ride' or 'to give someone a ride' can also mean 'to take someone somewhere as a passenger in your car', can't it?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Yes, it can – especially in American English. The meaning can be literal, or idiomatic: it's all about the context.</p>
<p><strong>Li<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Well, this time I'm not using it as an idiom but speaking as an American. Can you give me a ride home in your car?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Sure thing, Li. It will be a pleasure to have you riding in my car. No idiom. And my car is powered by more than just fresh air.</p>
<p><strong>Li<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Thank you, Rob. I'll try to be more suspicious of things which sound too good to be true.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /></strong>That's good. Okay. Li, come on. Jump in.</p>
<p><strong>Li<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Bye.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Bye.</p>"
"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />Hello, this is The English We Speak, with me Li…</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />… and me Neil. Hello! What's the matter with you, Li? You are upset, I can tell.</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />It's about my social media profiles, Neil. Some people keep posting negative messages all the time on my pages no matter what I write. It's not that they disagree with what I post. They just criticise everything - even when they don't give a proper reason.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Ah… Don't worry, Li. They might be what people are calling 'haters'.</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />'Haters'. Yes, I've heard this word before… the verb 'to hate' means to strongly dislike something, doesn't it?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Yes. And the word 'hater' has been used to describe someone who says or writes unpleasant things about others or criticises their achievements, especially on the internet.</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />That's right. And I've also heard 'troll'. Is that some kind of creature?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Well, language evolves and old words can take on new meanings. A troll is an ugly creature from folk tales who often behaves in an antisocial way. But these days we call people who leave deliberately annoying or upsetting messages on the internet - while hiding their true identity – 'trolls'.</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />'Troll' and 'hater' are today's expressions in The English We Speak. Let's hear some examples of how they are used.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />Joan is fed up with a troll who posts comments on her cooking blog saying that she is fat and should only eat lettuce.</p> 
<p>Haters will always have something negative to say. As I read in a comment on Pinterest: &quot;Haters will see you walk on water and say it’s because you can't swim.&quot;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />You shouldn't bother about 'haters', Li. As singer Taylor Swift says in her song Shake It Off, &quot;haters are gonna hate&quot;.</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />Yes, I like a good debate but 'haters' and 'trolls' don't want a debate. All they want is to annoy people.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />That's more like it. Now let me go and update my Facebook status and check my Twitter account.</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />Me too. Bye bye!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Li<br /> </strong>Ahhh… So cute! Sweet and cute!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /> </strong>Cat videos on the computer, Li?</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /> </strong>Yes, yes Rob. They're adorable!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /> </strong>What makes people so obsessed about these cat videos? Let me watch this one with you.</p> 
<p>(cat meowing)</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /> </strong>Oh, I've seen this one! It's everywhere! Look how many people clicked on this site to see it. About one hundred thousand by now!</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /> </strong>Yes, everybody loves Fluffy!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /> </strong>Fluffy. Yes. This cat is fluffy and … crazy!</p> 
<p>(cat growling)</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /> </strong>Look! It's gone viral!</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /> </strong>What do you mean? Fluffy is MY cat and she's very well-behaved and healthy. No virus in my cat!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /> </strong>In English, the expression 'to go viral' is used for a picture or a video which has become extremely popular by being circulated quickly and broadly on the internet.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /> </strong>Oh, viral… you mean it spreads quickly like a virus.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /> </strong>Yes. It can be used with a verb, 'to go viral', or just as an adjective before a noun. You can say 'viral video'. 'Viral' is today's expression in The English We Speak. Let's hear some examples of how it's used.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /> </strong><em>A video of First Lady Michelle Obama dancing with a turnip has gone viral on the internet. Hundreds of thousands of people have watched her video in support of healthy eating.</em></p> 
<p><em>Viral videos are big business nowadays and even marketing companies are posting amateur-looking videos in the hope of cashing in on the trend.</em> &nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /> </strong>So the viral part of what you said has been explained, but what about the 'crazy cat' part?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /> </strong>Li, I'm sorry. The good part is that it's gone viral so everybody finds your cat interesting. But the bad part is…</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /> </strong>Is…?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /> </strong>Is that you've got a very angry cat! Very fluffy and very angry! I know you love your pet but you've got to admit it is funny. Let's watch it again.</p> 
<p>(cat growling)</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /> </strong>It is funny!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /> </strong>You see? There you go. Fluffy is a star!</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /> </strong>Yes. Thank you, Rob!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /> </strong>You're welcome. Bye bye.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /> </strong>Bye.</p> 
<p>(cat growling)</p>"
"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak with me Neil…</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>…and me Li. Hello.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>In this programme, we're talking about clothes.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Clothes! Oh My favourite subject in the whole world! I know all the designers, I try different styles… I love clothes! Let's talk about MY clothes.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well… actually I thought we should talk about our smalls.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Smalls?! Do you think my clothes are too small for me? Are you calling me fat?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>No, Li. You look fine. 'Smalls' is a word we use for underwear.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Smalls. So you are talking about women's knickers and men's underpants, socks, women's bras…</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes. And we can refer to our underwear as 'smalls' or 'undies'.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Undies. That's easy to remember because it refers to what we wear under our clothes – undies.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Two easy words to remember when you talk about underwear. And remember they are always plural.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>I see. So you don't say 'one small' or one 'undy'.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>No, you don't. Smalls and undies are always used in the plural and they mean underwear. Now let's hear some examples of how these words are used.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Linda, hurry up or we'll miss the plane! Don't forget to pack your smalls!</p> 
<p>Billy, don't walk around the house in your undies. Your granny is coming to visit and she'll be here at any time.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Now don't forget that these words for underwear are very informal and British slang.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Well, smalls and undies can look good too, even if not many people will see them.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So you want to talk about fashion now.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Of course. I love fashion! Do you love fashion, Neil?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Er… not so much…</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Come on, Neil. Let's go shopping! I can help you choose the trendiest clothes… you've got to have a style. Let's go! Come on!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Okay.</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Hello, this is The English We Speak with me Li...</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>And me Rob. So Li, here we are, shopping again... So, what is it you're going to buy today?</p> 
<p><strong>Li &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Me? No, I thought you wanted to buy something? You said to me this morning <strong>give me credit</strong> - so here we are, all my credit cards, look, including my gold one - impressive, hey?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes. But Li, I didn't actually mean...</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>(Interrupting) So I'll buy something on my credit card and you can pay me back later - that's <strong>giving you credit</strong> - right?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Err, wrong Li. Although it's a nice idea. <strong>To give me credit</strong> means give me praise or appreciation for something I've done. And this morning I walked the dog, washed the car, did the shopping, and I still got to work at 9 o'clock! So please, give me credit!</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>OK, I'll have a think about whether you deserve credit while we hear some more examples of this phrase in action...</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>We must <strong>give credit to</strong> our sponsors who helped pay for this new building.</p> 
<p>I'll <strong>give her credit</strong> for her beautiful handwriting, but the answers she gave in the test were all wrong!</p> 
<p><strong>Give me credit</strong> - I worked all night to get the project finished!</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>So to give someone credit means to give them praise. I get the word <strong>credit</strong> now Rob. This has nothing to do with money, so I'll put away my credit cards... I'm not going to give you financial credit <em>or</em> credit in terms of praise.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No praise? Why's that?</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>You didn't walk the dog because you haven't got one, the car is still dirty, and I did all the shopping! So don't take the credit for things you haven't done!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>OK. Well, here's another phrase for you - <strong>give credit where it's due</strong>...</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Meaning?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>You should at least acknowledge the things I <em>have</em> done - like turning up at the studio today to record this programme!</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Of course, Rob, you are a credit to the BBC!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Ahh, thanks Li. Err... any chance I could borrow your credit card now?</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Welcome to The English We Speak: I'm Neil.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>And I'm Feifei.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>You know what, Feifei, I just love living here in London. I mean, the culture, the parks, the restaurants – it's got everything.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yeah, it's not bad, though to be fair it's not the cheapest place to live.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>You're right. Though most world capital cities are quite pricey to live in, to be fair.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Actually, to be fair, I think there are a lot of reasons to move out of the big city – you know, more space, better air, fewer people, and… nature!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Feifei, I think we've given good arguments on both sides, to be fair! And I hope we've demonstrated today's phrase – which is: to be fair.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>It's a phrase you'll hear a lot, especially in British English. It's used when you want to explain more than one side of an issue.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Let's listen to these examples:</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>We played well in the first half, but to be fair we were awful in the second half.</p> 
<p>Now, Luke. We know that wasn't your best exam result, but to be fair, you had very little time to prepare.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So – it's a phrase that we use to give balance in a discussion. And it comes just before or after making a point, or giving an opinion.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>But these days, especially in spoken English, people sometimes just use it when giving an opinion – whether or not it's really about fairness.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes, for example: To be fair, The Beatles were the best band of all time.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I think Italian food is the finest there is, to be fair.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So be careful when listening out for this phrase – sometimes it's just a 'filler' phrase, something people say a lot with no real meaning. It might not always mean what you expect it to!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>To be fair, that's why we make these programmes – to help people understand real English.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>And they are some of the best English learning materials available, to be fair.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Though, to be fair, other programmes are available!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Bye for now.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Neil and …</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Hi everyone. I’m Feifei and I've just …err… well…</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Feifei is here with me… Feifei, what's going on?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Yes, and today we are here, with you, dear learner of the wonderful English language…</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />What are you looking for?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />The script, Neil. I misplaced it somewhere…</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Just wing it!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Wing it? Wing, like a bird? Yes, the air is fresh and I flap my wings…</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />What are you doing? What are you doing?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />You told me to pretend I was a bird. Or to tell the story of a bird or… I know lots of bird jokes.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />No, that's not it. In English 'to wing' something means to improvise. This informal expression is thought to come from the theatre and it refers to performances given by actors who had to learn their lines quickly while waiting in the wings.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Ah! The wings are the space on each side of the stage, where actors wait before coming onto the stage. Sometimes someone gives them their lines from there as support.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />That's right. Let's hear how this expression is used:</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />Mary spent all weekend partying instead of studying. When I asked her why she wasn't concerned about the exam, she told me she'd just wing it.</p> 
<p>The minister is a great orator. He's never had a speech ready, he just wings it and people love it.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />So a theatrical expression for you. Now Feifei, do you know lots of jokes about birds? Tell me one.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Why did the little bird get in trouble at school?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Mmmm… no idea…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Because he was caught tweeting during the test.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Yes, very funny…</p> 
<p><strong>Both</strong><br />Bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Plates… OK. Spoons… all packed. That's one box full. The kitchen is finished, Neil!&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>All packed? Well done. Now let's move on to the bedroom.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>OK… I'm exhausted. In today's The English We Speak, Neil and I are moving house, and there's just so much packing to do. The house is full of cardboard boxes!<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>I know, I know Feifei. Listen, let's just finish this room and then we can sit down, relax and see what's on the box.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Neil, the last thing I want to do is look at any more boxes! I need a break.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Oh, of course. What I meant was: see what's on TV! 'On the box' is a slang expression meaning 'on TV'.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ok, why didn't you just say 'on TV'?! Anyway, let's play some examples while we finish packing.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Good idea.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>A: See anything good on the box last night?<br />B: Yeah! There was this great new series about spies.</p> 
<p>A: What are you up to tonight?<br />B: Not much, just gonna relax in front of the box.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes – you can also relax 'in front of the box', which means in front of the television. And which reminds me, Feifei: where is the box, I mean, our TV?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh, oh yes. I, err… packed it away already. But I don't remember which box I put it in.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>You mean the box, is in… a box? But we've packed 20 boxes already. Which one is it in?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Sorry! Let's just finish packing and then go out for dinner.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes, I've had enough of these boxes too, bye.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Neil and joining me is Feifei…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hiya.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Feifei, can you explain to our listeners why I'm sharpening an axe in the studio.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, I can – because in this programme, we've got an expression for you which contains the word 'axe'. It can have three different meanings: 1 - to have an opinion you want other people to accept.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>2 - to be angry or upset about something.&nbsp; to have a hidden plan.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>And 3 – to have a hidden plan.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>The expression is 'to have an axe to grind'. If you can imagine in the past, if someone did something bad to you, you might want to get revenge – and hurt the person. So you might need a sharp weapon – like an axe!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>That's horrible.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>In modern use, you can say that someone 'has an axe to grind' but it doesn't mean they're going to attack you with an axe!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Let's hear some examples of the different meanings of this expression.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Oh no here comes Roger. He's got an axe to grind about smoking, so you'd better put that cigarette out or he'll be talking to you for hours about your health.</p> 
<p>Don't suggest getting dinner from Yummy Chicken. Jim's had an axe to grind since they fired him last month.</p> 
<p>These local politicians have always got an axe to grind. You know they're hiding something from you.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So, in the first example, the expression 'to have an axe to grind' means to have an opinion you want people to accept. Roger is anti-smoking and he tells smokers just what he thinks of them. He has an axe to grind</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>In the second, Jim got fired by Yummy Chicken so he's upset and angry with the company. He wants some kind of revenge. He's got an axe to grind.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>And in the third one, the politicians are keeping secrets from people. There's something they want to do that they aren't telling you. They have an axe to grind. We should say that this use isn't very common in British English.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well now that's explained, Neil, I think you should put that axe away before someone gets hurt.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Good idea. It's very sharp now – feel it.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Argh! I'll have an axe to grind if you don't put that weapon away!</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello, I'm Neil…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>… and I'm Feifei and this is The English We Speak.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So do you want a cup of coffee then, Feifei?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, but you know the rules – no drinking coffee in the studio!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well that is the rule but nobody's looking so maybe we could sneak two cups in?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Sneak? Yes ok, you keep an eye out for the boss and I'll grab the coffee from the kitchen.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>…ok, <strong>the coast is clear</strong>!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Eh? <strong>The coast is clear</strong> – how do you know that? We're nowhere near the seaside.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>We don't need to be – it's just a saying. <strong>The coast is clear</strong> means it's safe to do something because nobody is watching – so we won't get caught.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ah, got you! So we're being a bit naughty, Neil?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes, that's right – hopefully nobody will ever find out what we're doing! Let's hear some more examples of this phrase…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I really wanted to know what my birthday present was, so when <strong>the coast was clear</strong>, I unwrapped it – I guess I've spoilt my surprise now!</p> 
<p><strong>The coast is clear</strong> so make a run for it before you get caught!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ok – so that's <strong>the coast is clear</strong> which means it's safe to do something which isn't allowed while nobody is watching. Right Neil, is the coast still clear?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes, but quick before someone comes. Quick… someone's coming!</p> 
<p><strong>Debbie<br /></strong>Oh hello Feifei… are you making coffee for the team? Thanks - I'll take those from you shall I? You wouldn't want to be caught drinking those in the studio now, would you? You know the rules! See ya.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Err, see you later, Debbie. Oh dear Neil, it looks like <strong>the coast wasn't clear</strong>.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>I think we got away with it. Anyway, that's the end of the programme. What shall we do now?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Coffee?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yeah. Good idea, let's go.</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Hello, I’m Neil and welcome to The English We Speak, which this week comes from a train.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Hi I'm Feifei. That's right, we've got on a train in order to teach you a useful English expression, which has become very common - particularly in a work environment.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />I love trains, Feifei – racing through the countryside, looking out of the window. Ah, it's great – you can't beat it! Oh – are you OK, Feifei? You look a bit… green.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Well it's OK for you, Neil, but I've got the backward-facing seat. It makes me feel sick. Going forward, can you avoid booking me the backward-facing seat?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Of course! Going forward I'll get you a forward-facing seat.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />(sounding sick) 'Going forward' is another way of saying 'in the future'.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />That's right. You'll hear 'going forward' used at business meetings when a person wants someone to change the way they do something in the future.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Here are some examples.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />A: Did you get the files I emailed over?<br />B: Yes I did, but going forward can you send hard copies in the post? We need them for our records.</p> 
<p>Boss: I've noticed you chatting on your mobile quite a lot during the working day. Going forward, can you keep the private conversations to your lunch breaks?</p> 
<p>A: Going forward we will only have an online version of our newspaper. The days of print are dead.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />So there you go. People speaking in an office environment use 'going forward' to mean in the future, from this point.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />I quite like doing The English We Speak recordings from the train. Going forward, shall we record all our programmes from vehicles?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Hmm, not sure about that. I get terrible travel sickness.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Well, going forward, I recommend you take these pills (hands bottle of pills over).</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Urgh…</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Goodbye!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello. Neil here with you. And this is Feifei.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>The word we are going to focus on today is the verb 'to downsize'. That's the word companies use to describe cutting a number of jobs and making employees redundant. 'Downsizing' is the noun.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes. When they make workers redundant the companies become smaller in size. They downsize. </p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>You might have heard or read this verb during the economic downturn of the last few years. As most people were short of money, they decided to save the money they did have and it had an impact on businesses all over the world. </p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>And some people have started applying the term to their own situations. If you've had to sell your house and move to a smaller flat, for example, you might say you were 'downsizing'.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>'To downsize' is today's expression in The English We Speak. Let's hear some examples of how it's used.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p> 
<p><em>The growth of online sales in the UK has forced many retail businesses to downsize. Some of them have reduced their number of outlets in the high street.</em></p> 
<p><em>Now that I am going to university, my parents have decided to downsize. They are selling the house, moving to a flat and using some of the money to travel the world.</em></p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>And if you don't mind me saying, Neil, I think you would benefit from downsizing.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>What do you mean? I don't own a company and I'm not selling my house or anything.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>No but I've noticed you've… well, you know, you really enjoy your food, don't you? </p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Are you calling me fat!?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh no, no, no… well, yes. A little.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>How dare you! And anyway, we don't use 'downsize' for bodies, so you're confusing our audience!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Sorry, Neil.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>I am a bit fat, actually…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well, maybe if the company downsizes, you won't be able to afford all those meat pies.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>That's what I like about you, Feifei. You always look on the bright side.</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello. I'm Neil. In this programme, we're going to talk about movies. Now, what kind of movies do you like, Feifei?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I love romcoms, Neil! 'Romcom' is a word which takes the first two halves of the words 'romantic' and 'comedy'. And what about you, Neil, what sort of movies do you like the most? </p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well, I can't resist a 'whodunnit'. 'Whodunnit' is short for 'who has done it'. The point of these films is for the audience to try to guess who committed a serious crime – usually murder.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ah, you like detective movies! In a 'whodunnit' you can try to beat the detective and work out who committed the crime. That's the fun of it! Sherlock Holmes is a perfect example. </p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes, 'romcom' and 'whodunnit' are today's expressions in The English We Speak. And ... there's one more. See if you can guess this one now Feifei: 'Hello. I'm a robot sent from the future to prevent war and destruction!' </p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>A sci-fi movie! 'Sci-fi is a word which takes the first two halves of the words 'science' and 'fiction.' These films usually feature robots, aliens and inventions from the future. I love sci-fi too. But sometimes it's scary!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well, there's no need to be scared of BBC Learning English - because we explain everything to you so clearly. Let's hear some examples of today's three movie-related expressions.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p> 
<p><em>My favourite <strong>sci-fi</strong> movie is Star Wars. I can't wait for the next film in the series!</em></p> 
<p><em>I'm catching a movie with my friends after work. We're going to watch the latest <strong>romcom</strong>.</em></p> 
<p><em>Alfred Hitchcock was the master of the <strong>whodunnit</strong>. Nobody makes better films in that genre than he did!</em></p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>That's it! I am fetching the popcorn! </p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>And I'm going to get some drinks! </p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Let's catch a movie! A sci-fi?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes, indeed! We're going to catch a movie… I am a robot who came from the future to catch a movie with you, Feifei. &nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>You deserve an Oscar! Let's go! Bye!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Neil…&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> …and I'm Feifei. So, Neil, did you hear anything?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>About what, Feifei?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Rob's new job. He must have told you something?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>No. He didn't even mention it.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>How strange. Not even a little clue?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>No, <strong>not a sausage</strong>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well, I'm sure we'll find out soon enough. In the meantime – let's explain that wonderful phrase you just used.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> In this programme we are teaching you the very cute but slightly old-fashioned phrase: <strong>not a sausage</strong>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> We use it to mean 'nothing at all'. It's generally used for emphasis or to show mild surprise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>It's informal and friendly. Let's listen to some examples to get a better sense of how it's used:&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>A: Did you find any good deals?<br />B: No, <strong>not a sausage</strong>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A: Did the boss say anything about my project?<br />B: No, sorry, <strong>not a sausage</strong>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A: Are there any sandwiches left?<br />B: I'm afraid not. <strong>Not a sausage</strong>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>That last one might have sounded confusing: No sandwiches left?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong><strong>Not a sausage</strong>! Yes, confusingly, we were asking about another kind of food – and the answer was still <strong>not a sausage</strong>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>You know what? All this talk of sausages is making me hungry.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Indeed. I'm meeting Rob for lunch – fancy joining?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Great. Hopefully he will finally <strong>spill the beans</strong> about this mysterious new job.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Ooh – <strong>to spill the beans</strong> – meaning to reveal your secrets. It's often used when you share a secret you didn't mean to share!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Another great phrase. So, what do you fancy for lunch?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well, it has to be a full English breakfast. With beans and… sausages!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>But of course! Bye everyone!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Bye.</p>"
"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />Hi and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Li and with me today is my colleague Neil.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Hello everyone. How was your Christmas, Li? Did you receive lots of nice presents?</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />Yes, loads. Nothing that was really expensive. Everything was cheap and cheerful.</p> 
<p>Neil<br />Oh, that's a nice phrase you used. When people say that something is cheap and cheerful, they mean the product doesn't cost much but it serves its purpose. The customer is happy with it!</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />So it is a positive phrase. Let's hear some examples of how it is used:</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />She enjoys shopping for cheap and cheerful presents.</p> 
<p>He made a lot of money from designing cheap and cheerful toys for children.</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />Some people design very clever little gifts. Look at this nice bracelet. It's actually a USB stick!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Oh, that reminds me of the smart watch my wife bought me online. In less than a week the battery has completely gone! It's useless.</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />Oh dear! If the quality is bad, I would use another phrase: 'cheap and nasty'! Let's hear a couple of examples:</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />Everything in this shop is cheap and nasty. Don't buy anything.</p> 
<p>My boyfriend is very stingy. The hotel where we stayed was cheap and nasty. I wouldn't recommend it.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />To be honest I don't like online shopping because you can easily be fooled by their wonderful-looking pictures.</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />I know. When people want to save some money by buying something cheap and cheerful they often end up wasting their money because the goods can turn out to be cheap and nasty.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />No one likes a product that is cheap and nasty, but I hope everyone likes the two phrases we have taught today.</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />Cheers!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Bye!&nbsp;</p>"
"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>OK Li, here it is - a nice bottle of red wine, some glasses... Let's celebrate your promotion... err... Li? ... Li, where are you?</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Down here, Neil! Down here!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>What on earth are you doing under the table?!</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>You have always said you can drink me under the table.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well, yes, I did say that...</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Well, here I am. Give me my wine please. &nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Li, in English, when you say you can drink someone under the table, you mean that if you and your friend both drink the same amount of alcohol, your friend will be very drunk, but you will be fine. In other words, you're saying that you've got a much higher tolerance of alcohol than another person.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Oh, that's what you meant! That's a relief! It was getting very hot and uncomfortable under the table.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>'To drink someone under the table' is today's expression in The English We Speak. Let's hear some examples of how it's used.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I do like a gin and tonic after a hard day at work but Alan can drink me under the table!</p> 
<p>When Beth realised she could drink anyone under the table she decided to stop drinking alcohol and go into rehab.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Oh OK. I get it now. There are so many funny expressions in the English language, Neil. It's fun to learn!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Yes! I'll drink to that! We have loads of these expressions... loads and loads!</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /> </strong>Oh dear. Sometimes I want to drink, just to forget that there's so much to learn!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Come on, Li. You've just been promoted. Let's celebrate with a toast.</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /> </strong>Cheers!</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p>Note: this is not a word-for-word transcript</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello, and welcome to The English We Speak. I’m Neil and… er… here with me…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Here with you is… Feifei. What are you looking for, Neil?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>I'm looking for my script...</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Your script?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yeah… and… my pen… I had it a moment ago… where's it gone? </p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>What's going on with you, Neil? You're all over the place today!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes, I am! That's a good expression: all over the place!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>It can mean that someone is disorganised and confused – they are all over the place. </p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes, and it can also mean that things are left in many places in an untidy way – your things are all over the place! Here are some examples of how this expression is used:</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Don't expect Simon to help you with your report. He’s all over the place right now - he can't even finish his own work.</p> 
<p>What a windy day. My hair's all over the place!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Well Feifei, I'm afraid I'm a bit disorganised today. You know I woke up late, I missed my bus and… well the day's just been a bit difficult. I <em>am</em> all over the place… and… where is it…?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong>&nbsp;<br />What are you looking for now?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>I still haven't found my script.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Is it this one?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes, that's it! Great!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>And here's your pen. It was on the floor.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Good. I'm ready to start the programme now.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>The programme's finished, Neil. It's done. &nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Oh, is it? So… we can go now? I could do with a coffee, Feifei. </p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes – it will do you good. Let's go. </p> 
<p><strong>Both <br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>And I'm Neil.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>And Neil, this might be the last ever time we see each other! All ready for your new job at… where was it again?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>A sweet factory.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Quite a big change from radio production.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yeah, well they pay very well. And I love sweets. I'll just <strong>suck it and see</strong>.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Suck… the sweets?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>No, you know what I mean!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, just kidding. The phrase <strong>suck it and see</strong> is used when you do something new and you're not sure whether you will like it or not – like a new job.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Here are some examples:</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I'm really not confident riding a bike in the centre of town. But all my friends do it, so I guess I'll just <strong>suck it and see</strong>.</p> 
<p>I decided to dye my hair blonde, but I'm still not sure about it. I'll <strong>suck it and see</strong>. I can always dye it black again!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well, you'll be pleased to hear Neil isn't really leaving.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>I realised I can explore my passion for sweets without actually working in a sweet factory. In fact, I have some right here.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ooh, lovely. Very bright colours. Mind if I…?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Please, try one.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>What flavours are they?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>I've got no idea. You'll just have to…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong><strong>Suck it and see</strong>! Mmm…</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>As Feifei is busy, I'll say goodbye for both of us. Bye.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Mmm…&nbsp;</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Feifei.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>And I'm Neil. Feifei – what do you think of my new phone?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Let's have a look – hmm… it looks… unusual.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>It's great. This guy sold it to me. He said it was a top-secret new model – it's not been released in the shops yet. Here, look…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>How do I… unlock it?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>You just… err… it's frozen. Let me just… no.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Who did you say you bought it from?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>A guy on the street.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I hate to say it Neil, but I think he <strong>pulled a fast one</strong> on you!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>But he… oh no.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Sorry. To <strong>pull a fast one</strong> means to deceive or play a trick on someone. We say you <strong>pull a fast one</strong> on or with somebody. The phone seller <strong>pulled a fast one</strong> on Neil. Listen to these examples:</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>The shopkeeper tried to <strong>pull a fast one</strong> on me. He gave me a &pound;5 note as change instead of a &pound;20 note.</p> 
<p>Don't you try and <strong>pull a fast one</strong> with me! I know you're not really sick. Get back to work.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So, that's it. All that money wasted. What an idiot. Oh, is that my phone?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Sorry, it's mine. Hello? Yes… No, I don't think so… Thanks!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Who was it?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>The guy called to say I've won a million pounds. All I have to do is give him my bank details and he'll pay me.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Someone else trying to <strong>pull a fast</strong> one!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Sadly, yes! I could do with a million pounds. I'd even buy you a new phone, Neil.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>You're too kind.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>And that's it for this edition of The English We Speak. Bye.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Bye.</p>"

<p><strong>Neil<br /> </strong>Not exactly, but I'm dying for a game of squash after work. I've brought all my gear, I've booked the court, but I have no one to play against. Are you game, Li?</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /> </strong>Well, I thought you knew this expression. The word 'game' doesn't just refer to sports or activities. If someone asks you if 'you are game,' they want to know whether you are willing to try something; whether you are interested in doing something fun or unusual.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /> </strong>I see. So you can use the word 'game' as an adjective as well as a noun?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /> </strong>That's right. Let's look at some examples:</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /> </strong>So many people in England are fans of football; they all love the game.</p> 
<p>Sam is brilliant at board games.</p> 
<p>A: I'm going to have a fancy dress party next Saturday. Would you like to come?<br /> B: Hey thanks! Yes, I'd love to. I'm game for a laugh.</p> 
<p>A: Hey Brian, I'm organising a football match between the managers and the workers, do you want to play?<br />B: Sure, count me in. I'm game.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /> </strong>So, how about playing squash this evening: I've got two rackets here. Are you game?</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /> </strong>Oh, well, I'm not sure. I've not played squash for a long time.Sorry no, I don't think I am game!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /> </strong>That's a pity. Maybe another time. But at least we have taught a useful English expression.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /> </strong>Yes we have, Neil. Enjoy your game. Bye for now!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Li</strong><br />Hello everyone, I'm Li. Welcome to the English We Speak. With me today is Neil.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Hello everyone.</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />Hi Neil, you look very happy today, what are you up to?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />I'm quite excited about my website: greatmindsshakehands.com. I've been designing it for months and it's nearly complete.</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />Wow, I like the sound of it. I didn't know you could design websites, Neil.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Well, it's for fun really. My website will be a public site where people can share ideas, you know, like-minded people. I want to launch it next week but first I must test the water.</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />Test the water, test what water? Does your website depend on water? I'm very confused!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />No Li, to test the water means to test the idea, try it out and see if it works.</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />I see. 'Test the water' is the phrase for the English We Speak today. Let's hear some examples of how people use it.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Woman A)</strong> <br />Have you started on your new book?</p> 
<p><strong>Woman B)<br /></strong>Yes, I've written three chapters and I've sent it to the publishers to test the water.</p> 
<p><strong>Woman A)</strong><br />Oh, what perfume are you wearing? It's lovely.</p> 
<p><strong>Woman B)</strong><br />Oh thanks. It's just a sample a company sent me. They're testing the water to see if people like it.</p> 
<p><strong>Woman A)</strong><br />How is your Shakespeare project going?</p> 
<p><strong>Woman B)</strong><br />It's early days; we're still testing the water.</p> 
<p><strong>Woman A)</strong><br />Well, good luck with it.</p> 
<p><strong>Woman B)</strong> <br />Thanks.</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />So Neil, how much testing have you done, have you got good feedback?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Well, my wife loves it, but most other people say they don't understand how to use it.</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />It sounds like it's not user-friendly.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />You're right. I think I need to make a few changes and then I'll test the water again.</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />I'm happy to be your guinea pig when you're ready.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />'Guinea pig', I think that's an expression for another programme. For now, it's goodbye from both of us.</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />Bye.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Goodbye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Hello and welcome to The English We Speak from BBC Learning English, I'm Neil and with me is Feifei.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Now Feifei, if you just put on your headphones you'll be able to hear what I'm saying.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, I know that.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>And you need to push that thing there – we call it a fader – we push that up and speak into the microphone.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ah, yes Neil I already know that.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>You see, Feifei, you have to be careful not to be too close to the microphone when you speak, because the pressure of your breath will create this sound - we call that a 'pop' and the recording will sound bad and our listeners will complain.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Neil! I've been working in radio for over 10 years! I know how to use the studio! Stop mansplaining.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Feifei, I was only doing it to introduce that word – mansplaining. It's a new word. It's made up of two parts – 'man' and 'explaining'. Mansplaining is when a man explains something to a woman as if they are stupid or knows less about a subject simply because she is a woman.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Here are some examples.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>So there was this guy mansplaining the offside rule to me. I've been playing football since I was 4 years old!</p> 
<p>Man: Push your foot down a bit harder on the clutch before you try to change gear. It'll make it much smoother.<br />Woman: Quit the mansplaining. I'm a taxi driver, OK?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Mansplaining. A man's explanation to a woman, which shows he thinks he knows more than her just because he's a man.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>And did you know Feifei that it's also a verb – to mansplain? Yes, language changes all the time, Feifei. New words come and old words change meaning. That's something all language learners need to know…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Neil! Stop! Mansplaining!</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />Hello, this is The English We Speak, with me Li… and Neil! … Neil?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Ah! Yes! Oh, hi Li, hi everyone!</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>What's taking all your attention? You can't stop looking at your smartphone!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Li, it's the stock exchange. I'm waiting to see if my shares have gone up. I want to be rich!</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />Yeah. But you have to remember that the stock market can be very volatile. It means the value of shares can go down as well as up. How do you know if the market is good for investors?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Well, experts say it's a bull market when the price of shares on the stock market is rising. And they say it's a bear market when the price of shares on the stock market is falling.</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />So a bull market is on the up and a bear market is when the price of shares is going down. Interesting. I wonder why…</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />It's easy to understand. Think about the way these animals attack. The bull thrusts its horns up into the air…</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />Oh, yes, that's frightening…</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />It is. And the bear, on the other hand, swipes its paws down, so the shares go down. Do you get it?</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />Yes, now I do. That makes it very clear. Let's hear some examples of how these expressions are used.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />Stocks rose in early trading. It was a bull market which stunned even the most pessimistic analysts. The financial crisis might be over.</p> 
<p>The index of the UK's biggest 100 companies, the FTSE 100, has fallen 15% in the last few months. However, we can only call it a bear market when the index drops 20% or more.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />So you see, a bear market for when values are falling, and a bull market for when they're rising.</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />Neil, you are not a big investor and you are not exactly an expert in high finances, are you?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Well… er…no, not really.</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />Stop dreaming. If you like animals so much, let's spend the afternoon at the zoo.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Well, that is a good idea! But could we stop by my stock broker's office on the way?</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />You are really hooked on this, aren't you? Let's go. Bye!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Bye!</p>"
"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p> 
 <p class=""bbctext""><strong>Yang Li</strong><br />Hello and welcome to the English We Speak from BBC Learning English. I'm Li. Neil... Hey, where is Neil? Although he's great presenter he's often late. Oh, here he comes!</p> 
 <p class=""bbctext""><strong>Neil</strong><strong><br /></strong>Sorry, sorry Li, I'm here now. Sorry, I'm a bit late.</p> 
 <p class=""bbctext""><strong>Yang Li</strong><br />Wow Neil, you look so different today: a suit and tie - what's happening?</p> 
 <p class=""bbctext""><strong>Neil</strong><strong><br /></strong>Well, I have to present our video: 'The Perfect English Gentleman' it's called.</p> 
 <p class=""bbctext""><strong>Yang Li</strong><br />That sounds fun. Don't you want to do it?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p class=""bbctext""><strong>Neil</strong><strong><br /></strong>Not really.</p> 
 <p class=""bbctext""><strong>Yang Li</strong><br />Why not? You are a great presenter. Everyone loves your voice.</p> 
 <p class=""bbctext""><strong>Neil</strong><strong><br /></strong>Well, it's not my voice that's the problem. Look at this massive, broken nose and spotty skin, my missing teeth, and long greasy hair... Li, I'm pretty ugly. I kept saying to my boss that I have a face for radio, but he insisted I present the video. What can I do?</p> 
 <p class=""bbctext""><strong>Yang Li</strong><br />Did you say you have a face for radio? But you don't need to show your face as a radio presenter, do you?</p> 
 <p class=""bbctext""><strong>Neil</strong><strong><br /></strong>That's exactly the point, Li. If you say someone's got a good face for radio, it's an indirect way of saying they are not very good looking!</p> 
 <p class=""bbctext""><strong>Yang Li</strong><br />I see. I like this phrase 'a face for radio' - an indirect way of saying someone is not very attractive. Here are some examples:</p> 
 <p class=""bbctext""><strong>Examples</strong><br />Man: Jane looked beautiful at her wedding.<br />Woman: Really? She must have had a good make-up artist because, to be honest, she's got a face for radio.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p class=""bbctext"">Man: No one's going to choose me at this speed-dating event.<br />Woman: Why on earth not? You're such a warm-hearted guy.<br />Man: Thanks. But you have to admit, I've got a face for radio.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p class=""bbctext""><strong>Yang Li</strong><br />So that's 'a face for radio' - our expression today. Hey Neil, I think I have got a solution for your video presenting problem... How about this for a good opening line? Do you want to hear it?</p> 
 <p class=""bbctext""><strong>Neil</strong><strong><br /></strong>Go on then.</p> 
 <p class=""bbctext""><strong>Yang Li</strong><br />(clearing her throat):&nbsp; 'This modern English gentleman has got a face for radio. Just shut your eyes, relax and listen...'</p> 
 <p class=""bbctext""><strong>Neil</strong><strong><br /></strong>Now you're making fun of me, Li!</p> 
 <p class=""bbctext""><strong>Yang Li</strong><br />OK, seriously, I think you will be just as good on video as you are in front of a microphone. You have a unique way of saying things which is clear, funny and engaging. What face could beat that!</p> 
 <p class=""bbctext""><strong>Neil</strong><strong><br /></strong>Thanks Li. I feel a lot more confident now! Just pass me that mirror... Actually I'm not that bad looking, am I?</p> 
 <p class=""bbctext""><strong>Yang Li</strong><br />No, you're not. You've got a face for TV and a voice for radio!</p> 
 <p class=""bbctext""><strong>Neil</strong><strong><br /></strong>Hey, thanks Li, you've made my day!</p> 
 <p class=""bbctext""><strong>Both</strong><br />Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil<br /> </strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak with me Neil...</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>...and me, Feifei. In this programme, we've got an expression which means 'to be very rich'.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> And, as usual, in order to demonstrate the meaning of something, I'm going to make a fool of myself. Now, Feifei, please describe what I'm doing.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> OK, so now Neil is rolling around on the floor covered in... money.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />So, Feifei, how much money does someone need to roll in it?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Lots!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> And so we have an expression in English - 'to be rolling in it'. It means to be extremely rich.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> That's right. Imagine a person has so much money they can literally roll around in it and you can understand this expression. Now get up Neil.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />OK. Let's hear some examples.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Carlos is always moaning about lack of money but his parents are rolling in it, so he should just ask them for some.</p> 
<p>Since tuition fees have been introduced, you need to be rolling in it to afford university.</p> 
<p>My neighbours must be rolling in it - they're having a swimming pool and tennis court built in their garden.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So, there we are - we say someone is 'rolling in it' if they're very rich.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I'd love to be rolling in it.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>OK then - come and join me!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /> </strong>No, I mean that I'd like to be rich - but that does look quite fun actually... woah!</p>"
"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello, welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Feifei...</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>...and I'm Neil. Hello. We're out shopping today, aren't we, Feifei?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Yes, Neil needs to buy a new bed - his old bed has broken. So Neil, look at all these beds - there are so many to choose from but which one do you want to buy?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well, that one there is massive but it wouldn't fit through my front door!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Hmm, that one there is quite cheap but... it doesn't look very well made.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hey look at this one... a water bed! Listen to the sound it makes!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh, there are too many beds to choose from!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><strong><br /></strong>Well, Feifei, I'll have to sleep on it!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /> </strong>Neil! You can't sleep on that water bed - you haven't bought it yet - and anyway, you haven't brought your pyjamas!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Relax Feifei - I'm not going to sleep here in the shop - that would be embarrassing! When someone says they're going to sleep on it, they mean they're going to spend some time thinking about something before making a final decision.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Phew! So you make your final decision later - not now? &nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>That's right! So I'm going to think about which is the best bed to buy and come back in the morning, OK? Let's hear some other examples of the phrase 'to sleep on it'...</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>We couldn't decide which car to buy so we decided to sleep on it - we didn't want to buy the wrong one!</p> 
<p>Thanks for your job offer but I need some time to think about it. Let me sleep on it and I'll give you an answer tomorrow.</p> 
<p>He told me he'd have to sleep on it before he could agree to my request for a pay rise.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>To sleep on it... hmm... but why 'sleep' Neil?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Because usually you think about your decision overnight - you literally go to sleep before waking up the next day and deciding what to do, when you've had more rest.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>It sounds like a good idea but hold on Neil...&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>What's wrong?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> You can't 'sleep on it' overnight because you haven't got a bed to sleep on!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /> </strong>Well, let's not <em>lose sleep over it</em> - you've got a spare bed haven't you?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /> </strong>What?!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /> </strong>It's another idiom Feifei but I'll explain it another time. Come on let's go.</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /> </strong>Bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Neil and joining me today is Li.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Hello everyone. The expression that Neil and I will talk about today is &quot;out for the count&quot;.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>This expression comes from the sport of boxing and describes a boxer who has been knocked unconscious who can't stand up within a count of ten seconds. The boxer is said to be &quot;out for the count&quot; and loses the match.&nbsp; But the expression can also be used in another way...</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Oh, how?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well, I had a really active weekend. I went hiking in Wales with my wife and our two children.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Hiking in Wales, that sounds like hard work.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well not to my kids. They loved it, they were racing each other, running up and down the hills…then we went to the zoo where they had more fun.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>So you had a nice day out then?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Definitely. The evening was even nicer for us, me and my wife as there was no reading of bedtime stories and no computer games. By 7 o'clock, the kids were in bed, and the next thing we knew, they were out for the count!</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Oh I think I've got it. Do you mean they were so tired from all the exercise that they fell asleep immediately their heads touched the pillows?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes, that's right. Let's hear some examples how this expression is used:</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p> 
<p><em>Jack had so much to drink last night that when he got home he was out for the count.</em></p> 
<p><em>There was some trouble outside my house last night but I didn't hear it: I was so tired I was out for the count.</em></p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Oh, how I wish I could fall asleep quickly – but I often have to take a sleeping pill.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>That's not good. You should try doing some exercise to make you tired: how about jogging?</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Oh no, it's boring, it's too monotonous.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well, how about something relaxing like yoga?</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Yoga, no, I'm not very flexible, I never have been.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well, what about boxing? It's exciting and you could be knocked unconscious - out for the count!</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Very funny!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Anyway you have learned a good expression and it's time to say goodbye.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Hello, this is The English We Speak, with me Feifei…</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />… and me Neil. Hello!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Neil, what a nice mobile phone you have with you! Wow! Very flashy! Gold colour!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />It's brilliant! The battery lasts a long time. It's got loads of memory - it has plenty of room for apps, pictures, videos… And the camera is great too!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />It must have cost a fortune!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Not at all, it was a steal!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Neil!!!! Oh, you shouldn't have done that! You're such a nice guy. Why would you do something like that? You could have taken out a loan to buy it or something, but…</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />What do you mean?</p> 
<p>(Sound of a police car siren)</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />They are here! They've come for you!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />No that was just a sound effect. I'm just having a joke with you – I'm not going to be arrested! In English, when you say something is 'a steal' you mean it's a bargain – so cheap that it’s almost as if you haven't paid anything for it.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Oh, you're so naughty!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Sorry Feifei, it was just a joke. Let's hear examples of how this expression is used.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I got this designer shirt in the sales. At &pound;100 cheaper than the original price it's a steal!</p> 
<p>This is the latest model, sir. You won't find this new computer cheaper in any other shop in the high street. It's a steal!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />See?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Yes. 'It's a steal' means it's a bargain.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />So, as I was saying, my phone was so cheap. My phone!!! Where is it?! I had it right here where has it gone?!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Yeah – where is it? … It was right there…</p> 
<p>(Sound of a police car siren)</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Yes! Now I really do need to call the police.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />No, you don't. Your phone is here! I hid it when you got distracted.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Nice one Feifei – revenge for my phone joke at the beginning. And for the listeners - don't steal anything. 'It's a steal' is just an expression.</p> 
<p><strong>Both</strong><br />Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>…Hello and welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Neil. (conspiratorially) Feifei will be joining me in just a second. She's a little bit… sensitive, so I'm going to try to deliberately upset her - just to teach you an expression in English!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hi Neil</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Oh hi Feifei! What do you think of the new Justin Bieber album?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh it's just great. I love it!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Really? (Pause) I think it's rubbish. You must have terrible taste to like Justin Bieber.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Neil that's so rude!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> It's not rude – it's just a difference of opinion. Honestly Feifei, you're such a snowflake.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh you mean beautiful and totally unique?!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Err, no… I mean you melt easily. You can call someone who gets offended or upset too easily a 'snowflake'. Here are some examples:</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>A so-called friend of mine deleted a comment I made on his social media page just because I didn't agree with him. What a snowflake.</p> 
<p>There are so many places you can express yourself these days but at the same time everyone gets offended so easily. You can see why it's called 'generation snowflake'.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Generation snowflake. This expression refers to young adults who are too sensitive to handle criticism of their opinions.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> This is pretty insulting, Neil.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>It IS pretty insulting, Feifei – but you're only upset because you're such a snowflake… Though, of course you're also unique and beautiful…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh I see – trying to be nice in case you offend me? Who's the snowflake now, Neil!?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well it's just better if we all get along, isn't it? Bye!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Neil and joining me is Feifei… and Fred... my goat.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hi everyone. Neil, why have you brought this… goat into the studio? It smells.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Fred doesn't smell! I've brought my goat into the studio to teach our listeners an expression you can use when something annoys you.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Well, having smelly animals in the studio annoys me.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Well, in that case, Feifei, you can say, 'Smelly animals in the studio get my goat.'</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> To get somebody's goat – an expression you can use when something annoys you.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>That's right. You can say something 'gets your goat' if it annoys you. You know what, Feifei? It gets my goat when people say my pet Fred is smelly.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Ha! Here are some examples of people using the expression 'get somebody's goat'.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>These queues at the post office really get my goat. I've been waiting for half an hour!</p> 
<p>Argh, I don't believe it – I've got a parking ticket! Traffic wardens really get my goat!</p> 
<p>These calls from people selling insurance get my goat. They've rung seven times already this morning.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>To get somebody's goat – an expression you can use when something annoys you.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Notice that we often use 'really' with this expression. Train delays <em>really</em> get my goat.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>It seems to me quite a lot of things get your goat, Feifei.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Not really, Neil – apart from Fred.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Are you saying my goat gets your goat?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Yes! Your goat <em>really</em> gets my goat!&nbsp;</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>(Tango music playing) Hello and welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Neil and joining me is Feifei...</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Hi there. In this programme we've got an expression that means two people are involved in a tricky situation and both must accept blame and responsibility. Neil, what on earth are you doing?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Dancing! (Tango music playing)&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, I can see that but... on your own. You look pretty ridiculous if you don't mind my saying.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Well, Feifei, that's because it takes two to tango!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Yes it does take two to tango - and that is our expression for this programme.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> But the meaning's not as simple as you might think. Let's listen to some examples and then explain a little more.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>The ref should have sent both players off. I know Smith kicked Cooper but it takes two to tango.</p> 
<p>Everyone blames Charlie for their break up but Lizzy was just as bad. It takes two to tango.</p> 
<p>They should arrest the dodgy agent as well as the manager. After all it takes two to tango.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So, as you can see, 'It takes two to tango' is used to talk about bad or difficult situations.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, it's used to say that two people - not just one - are responsible for that bad situation.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> (Tango music playing) So, Feifei, won't you join me for this dance?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>You're not exactly a great dancer, Neil. Though, I have to admit, I'm pretty terrible too.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Who cares?! It takes two to tango!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Argh! You stepped on my toes!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Sorry!</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Hi Neil. How are you? You're looking quite proud of yourself…</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yeah, I'm great thanks. You know, I've managed to finish off my part of the script of our drama – you know the BBC Learning English Christmas drama.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Oh great! And did you remember to book the band for tomorrow's recording? The big boss is coming, you know. He's really looking forward to it?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Oh no I forgot! I knew there was something else I was supposed to do! Now I'm really going to have to face the music.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Face the music? How can you face the music if you haven't booked a band?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>I thought you knew this expression, Li. To face the music is another way of saying you have to accept the consequence of your mistakes. &nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Oh I see. The boss was expecting you to do something and you haven't done it. Now you have to face the music – accept the consequences of your mistake.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>To face the music is today’s expression for The English We Speak. Listen to some examples:&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p> 
<p><em>Whoever keeps missing these deadlines will have to face the music.</em></p> 
<p><em>After two years of stealing from the family who hired her, the nanny was caught stealing red-handed. Now she has to face the music.</em></p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So Li, you're quite a good musician, aren't you?</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Well, I can play the guitar a bit…</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Fantastic! Bring your guitar in tomorrow for the recording. You play the music to stop me facing the music!</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Well… OK, but I'm not very good…</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>You will be fantastic I’m sure. Thanks Li!</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>OK. Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello I'm Feifei and this is The English We Speak.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>And hello, I'm Neil. Today Feifei, I'm going to teach you a piece of authentic English that describes me. Any guesses what it might be?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hmmm... 'Lazy-bones'?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Ha! No, one that describes my many talents.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Err… 'Full of yourself'?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>No Feifei – think about my skills – all the things I do in the office, for example.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Sorry Neil – I have no idea.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>It's <strong>jack-of-all-trades</strong>.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>But your name's not Jack!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>It doesn't have to be for this phrase. A <strong>jack-of-all-trades</strong> is someone who can do many kinds of jobs – you could say they're multi-skilled.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ok. Yes, I know this phrase but it just doesn't describe you!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Look, let me tell you what I can do, while we hear some more examples. OK?!</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>If you need any work doing to your house, get my Dad round – he's a <strong>jack-of-all-trades</strong>!</p> 
<p>Jane's got a great business – she runs a cafe where she makes and sells the cakes, she does the marketing and her own accounting – she really is a <strong>jack-of-all-trades</strong>.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So that's <strong>jack-of-all-trades –</strong>&nbsp;a phrase that describes someone – a man or a woman –&nbsp;who can do many different types of work. We could call them an all-rounder. But sorry Neil – making the tea and presenting The English We Speak does not make you a <strong>jack-of-all-trades</strong>.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So you think I am a jack-of-some-trades? Don't forget I wrote this script, I can edit, I can make coffee as well as tea.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>But some people say '<strong>jack-of-all-trades</strong>, master of none' – which means you can do many things but you're not an expert in any of them! A real <strong>jack-of-all-trades</strong> can do many different jobs – all to a good standard.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well… Right, well I'm off.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Where are you going?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>To find this guy Jack – to see if he really exists.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh dear. Bye!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Helen and joining me today is Neil.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></strong>Hello everyone. </p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>So Neil, where did you go last weekend? <br /><strong><br />Neil<br /></strong>I went to a car boot sale near my home. There were lots of sellers getting rid of unwanted Christmas presents.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>So did you manage to pick up any bargains?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Plenty, I got presents for my kids to last the rest of the year. And I picked up this little gem. Look!</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>What is it?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>It’s an old silver English coin. </p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Is it real? It looks quite new to me.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>It does, doesn’t it? I had a close look and it’s in good nick.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Good Nick? Who's Nick?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Oh, I don’t mean Nick as a person’s name. When British people say ‘it’s in good nick’, we mean ‘it’s in good condition’, especially if it’s something that’s very old but still looks new. Here are a few examples:</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I picked up a set of silver plates from an antique shop and they were in pretty good nick.<br />&nbsp;<br />My grandpa loves his 1960s motorbike and has worked very hard to kept it in good nick.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>I know it sounds a bit strange to use a word that’s like a person’s name in this phrase, but it’s very authentic colloquial British English. ‘Nick’ here is slang for ‘condition’.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>I see. Can we use the phrase to describe anything else in good condition? </p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Absolutely, how about my grandmother, she’s 96 and still does her own shopping, she’s in good nick. </p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>That’s impressive. I hope I'll be in good nick when I get to her age. </p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Keep fit and eat well!</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Neil and joining me is Feifei…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> I've got a medical experiment to perform on you in this programme, Feifei.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Righhhhht…</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Come on – it's for our listeners. We've got an expression which means to react to something without thinking about it carefully first. So, cross one leg over the other, like that.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>What are you doing with that hammer?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Keep calm – it's OK, I'm not going to hurt you. And I'll just tap your knee… And… it worked!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes Neil, well done. You've just tested my reflexes. When you hit my knee with the hammer, my leg kicked automatically. I didn't even think about it.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>It was a knee-jerk reaction. And in English we can say that someone has a knee-jerk reaction when they act after an event without thinking carefully.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Let's hear some examples of 'knee-jerk reaction'.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>After the terrorist attack, the government should be careful to avoid a knee-jerk reaction. A declaration of war could lead to even bigger problems later.</p> 
<p>He left his wife after he saw her having a drink with another man but it was a knee-jerk reaction. He'll be back.</p> 
<p>Putting up interest rates because of inflation is a knee-jerk reaction. They haven't thought of the other consequences.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>A knee-jerk reaction. Acting automatically, without thinking about the consequences.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Let's try that again with the other knee. Here we go… (Smacking sfx) Argh – you kicked me in the face!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Sorry Neil – it was just a knee-jerk reaction.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Ow…</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil and with me today is Helen (crashing noises). Um, Helen what are you doing?</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Oh I'm just stamping on this clock. </p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes, I can see that you are really… destroying that clock. My question is… why?</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Well, don't you remember you told me that you were going to be a little late for the recording session?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes, I had to delay things by an hour.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>And I asked you what I should do while I was waiting.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes that's right.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>And you told me that I should just kill time. So that's what I'm doing… killing time.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well I did tell you to kill time, but I didn't mean destroy a clock. In English, when you say you are 'killing time', it means you are doing something that isn't really important just to occupy yourself before the start of your next plan or arrangement.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Yeah, that's right. Killing time has nothing to do with violence towards clocks. It's an expression which means to do something which isn't really important just to keep you occupied until the start of your next plan or arrangement. Here are some examples.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p> 
<p><em>I turned up an hour early for my flight, so I just looked at the duty free to kill some time.</em></p> 
<p><em>I had an hour between work and meeting my friends so I killed time in a department store.</em></p> 
<p><em>I always arrive hours early for job interviews. I'd rather have to kill time than deal with the stress of being late!</em></p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So Helen, you can stop smashing up that poor clock now. </p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>But you know what? I'm quite enjoying it.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>It looks like you are enjoying it… and it looks quite fun. Do you mind if I…</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Not at all… join me. (smashing)</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Actually, this is the most fun I've ever had killing time!</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Me too! Join us again soon for The English We Speak.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Bye! (smash)</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Neil and joining me is Feifei.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Hi everyone.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>In this programme we have an expression which means 'to make a great effort to achieve something'.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Neil, why are you wearing that running gear in the studio? I'm not sure that shorts and a vest are appropriate for the workplace! As for those sweatbands…</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Well, Feifei, it's because I'm desperate to get fit. You see, I'm running a marathon at the end of the month and I've barely started training. I'm really going to have to bust a gut to be ready on time.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Yes, you really do need to start training but surely busting&nbsp;a gut is not going to help!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> I'm not going to bust my gut literally! To bust a gut means 'to make a huge effort to achieve something'. Imagine working so hard that your stomach – or gut – actually breaks!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Urgh! Here are some examples of the expression 'to bust a gut':</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>We're going to have to bust a gut to get this report done by tomorrow. We're only half-way through and it's already 7pm.</p> 
<p>The problem with today's millionaire footballers is they're not prepared to bust a gut for their national team.</p> 
<p>There are train strikes and the traffic is terrible. I had to bust a gut to get here on time today.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>To bust a gut – to make a great effort to achieve something.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>As you can see from the examples, we can use 'to bust a gut' to talk about non-physical activities as well.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes so come on Feifei. We need to bust a gut to get this programme finished so I can go out for a training run.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Alright, alright, we're done now – go and bust a gut.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> I'm off – bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. In this programme we have an expression which you can use when you are under a lot of pressure. I'm Neil and joining me is Feifei.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Feifei, if you don't mind me saying, you're looking a little… informal today.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well it's true I wouldn't normally come to work in my beachwear but you did warn me about the temperature.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>The temperature? To be honest the temperature feels pretty normal in here today and… well, no one else is wearing a bikini.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So why did you text me to say, 'Just to warn you, the heat is on'?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Ahhh I see. I meant that we've got to record and publish the programme by midday – so we're under pressure to get it done. The expression 'the heat is on' is not actually connected to the temperature… Sorry.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>(embarrassed) Right. OK. Let's hear some examples while I wrap myself in a towel:</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>The deadline's tomorrow and we haven't even started! The heat's really on now.</p> 
<p>The heat is on for United. If they don't win their last 5 matches they'll lose their place in the Premier League.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So, 'the heat is on' is an expression you can use to describe a high-pressure situation.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes and the heat might really be on for you now, Feifei.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> What do you mean?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well, swimwear is against the office dress code. Look out! Here come the BBC fashion police.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Quick – throw me my flip-flops and I'll run!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Off you go. Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hello, I'm Rob…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>… and I'm Feifei and this is The English We Speak. Hold on… Rob, are you eating?!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I am. Would you like a crisp? They're cheese and onion flavour.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh go on then – oh, I see you've eaten most of them, but I'll have the last one, shall I?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Actually Fefei, there weren't many crisps to start with – it's this 'shrinkflation'.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Shrinkflation – I guess that's the opposite of 'inflation'?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>That's correct – inflation is where prices rise, or the size of things get bigger – they inflate – like a balloon. But with shrinkflation things get smaller – but not the physical size of things, it's the quantity of something.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I see. So the crisp packet is the same size, but the number of crisps in side has been reduced.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>That’s right. Let's hear some examples of other people using the work 'shrinkflation'…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I paid the same price for this chocolate bar as I always have, but when I unwrapped it, it was smaller – I guess that's shrinkflation!</p> 
<p>It appears lots of brands are practising shrinkflation these days, probably to cut costs and maximise their profits.</p> 
<p>I don't believe it! There used to be 20 biscuits in the packet, but now shrinkflation means there are only 16!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So shrinkflation is where the quantity of something is reduced. Why does this happen Rob?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well, it's a marketing trick – it's so a manufacturer does not put up the price of a product, but just reduces the cost of making it by putting less inside – but we think we're getting the same amount.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Clever! It's the same these days with chocolate bars, packets of cereals…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>… and BBC Learning English programmes.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>What?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes, even this programme is affected by shrinkflation – there's less in it – even though our listeners might think they're getting the same amount. Come on it's time to go.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Really? This programme seems to go on for longer than ever.</p> 
<p><strong>Both</strong><br /> Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hello, I'm Rob…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>… and I'm Feifei and this is The English We Speak.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>… and today we're outdoors, in the park, having a picnic.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, a picnic – it's very nice, thanks for preparing it Rob.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh no problem…. Well actually, it was a problem…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei&nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh, I thought preparing a picnic would be easy.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No. First I had to find some money to buy some food, then I had to walk to the supermarket because my car isn't working, then I had to prepare the food, then I had to go to work…. and then I had to…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh I get it, it was an effort.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>What I'm saying is it was no picnic!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Huh? It is Rob, look, sandwiches, crisps, salad, strawberries…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>That's a picnic but making it was 'no picnic' – I mean there was nothing easy or pleasant about it.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I get it! Let's hear some more examples of situations that are 'no picnic'…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Having no job and trying to pay the bills is no picnic.</p> 
<p>It's no picnic going on a camping holiday with the kids – they moan all the time!</p> 
<p>Living on the fifth floor without a lift is no picnic; I have to carry everything up the stairs.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So when you say something is 'no picnic' you mean it's a difficult or unpleasant situation. Well Rob, it may have been difficult to prepare but it was worth the effort – the food is delicious.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh thanks very much.</p> 
<p>(FX: Thunderstorm begins)</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh no, rain! I think we'd better take cover. Quick!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh dear, it seems that this is literally no picnic.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Come on let's drive home.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br /> We can't. My car's not working remember?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh yes. Bye.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Neil.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello, I'm Feifei. All well, Neil?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Not great, Feifei.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>What's up?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>I'm just so done with writing this report.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>You're done with it? You've finished?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>I wish. The opposite. Lots more to do.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So you're not done yet?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Sadly no. If you say you're 'so done with' something – it means you are irritated and bored by it! Often it's a task that you don't want to do.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Indeed. For example, I could say: &quot;I'm so done with recording with Neil.&quot;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>You could say it, Feifei. But it wouldn't be true!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Of course it's not true. Let's hear some examples.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I need a new job. I'm so done with delivering pizza.</p> 
<p>I need to get to bed earlier. I'm so done with feeling like a zombie every day.</p> 
<p>I'm so done with learning Hungarian. The grammar is so hard!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So Neil, do you need some help with the report?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>That's kind. I just need to sit down, focus, and write the thing. It's just boring.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>If you like, we can swap. I'm making an incredibly dull spreadsheet right now.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Wow. Sounds great.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I'm so done with it.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Tell you what. Let's work hard all afternoon and then treat ourselves to dinner.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Done! Which means, of course, that I agree to your suggestion.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Perfect. Bye for now.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>See you later!</p>"
"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei and with me is Rob.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hello everyone. Hi Feifei, how are you?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I'm very well, Rob, thank you. Which cool phrase have you brought to share with us?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I'd like to introduce the phrase 'to hot-desk' and the idea behind hot-desking in modern offices.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I know this one, Rob. To hot-desk or hot-desking is an increasingly popular way of working to save office space.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes, not like before, where everyone had their own desk, in a hot-desking office there are certain number of desks and computers available for people to use, and anyone who needs them can use them.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>This way, companies can save space by reducing the overall number of desks it needs to provide because not everyone is at work every day.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>That's right. Throughout the year, there are always people on leave, away from the office or off sick. It's more common to see hot-desking in big organisations.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Let's hear some examples of people talking about hot-desking.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>BBC New Broadcasting House is a hot-desking environment. People just sit wherever there is a free computer.</p> 
<p>Hot desks should be kept clean and tidy at all times because you don't know who will use them next.</p> 
<p>Many modern office workers are expected to hot-desk.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>So we heard people using 'hot desk' in three different ways.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes. Remember hot-desking is the noun form of the verb 'to hot-desk'.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>When you write 'to hot-desk', don't forget 'hot' and 'desk' needs to be hyphenated.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>The actual desk we use to do hot-desking is called a 'hot desk' - without the hyphen between the two words.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>OK, I think that's enough 'hot-desking' for now.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh wait, Rob. I haven't got a desk today, I need to go and find a hot desk! Bye!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Good luck! Bye bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Rob&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Delete! Delete! Delete!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Rob? Why are you so annoyed? And what are you deleting.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Can't you see, Feifei? I'm checking and deleting my emails and … all this phishing!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>I thought you liked fishing, Rob. You always show us pictures of all the big fish you've caught.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>No. Fishing with an 'F' is good but phishing with a 'ph' is not!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>So you're deleting all the 'ph's? All the spelling mistakes?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>It's not a spelling mistake. Phishing – with 'ph' - is one of those words that's become popular as we use the internet more and more. It's the name of a particular kind of fraud on the internet.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Fraud?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Yes. It's what we say when someone sends you an email pretending to be a reputable company or person hoping you'll respond and give them your personal information. They want things like your bank account number, password, that kind of thing.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Oh! So the email is a bait!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Yes, exactly. 'Phishing' with 'ph' is today's expression in The English We Speak. Let's hear some examples of how it's used.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br clear=""none"" /></strong><em>Our bank never sends emails to clients asking them to reply to a message confirming their password. I'm afraid you've been a victim of phishing, sir.</em></p> 
<p><em>I've just received an email informing me that I won the lottery. They want my bank details to deposit the prize. But I've never entered the lottery. This must be phishing!</em></p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>So now you know what kind of phishing I was talking about!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Yes. They wanted your bank details, but we're not taking their bait, are we?<strong>&nbsp; </strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>No, we're not. Definitely not!<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Hmmm, I think I have some of these phishing emails in my inbox too.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>So let's get rid of them all! Come on!</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Delete! Delete! Delete! Bye!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Delete!</p>"
"<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Rob and I've won yet another card game! Yes!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello everyone. I’m Feifei and I've just lost to him again...</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>It's not surprising. You've been very distracted all morning.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>There's a promotion coming up and I wonder if I'll get it.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well, you work hard Feifei. I'm sure a promotion is on the cards.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>It's on the cards?! But I haven't been paying much attention to them! Which cards?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No, it's not actually written on any cards. It's an expression. In British English, we say something 'is ON the cards' - or 'IN the cards' in American English - when we mean that something is likely to happen.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So you mean that it's possible and even likely that I'll get a promotion because I work hard?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes. Here are some examples of how this expression is used:</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Wage rises are on the cards in the UK. There are now signs that things are getting better for ordinary British workers.</p> 
<p>My son might be ready to settle down. He's had lots of girlfriends but now he's going steady with a colleague and a wedding might be on the cards.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Great! So I'm likely to get that promotion. It's on the cards!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes. And there's something else on the cards today.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh really, what is it?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I'm going to win another round of this game! Look, I've got three aces now!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>OK. You deserve it. You are a good player and have luck on your side. Another win is definitely on the cards!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Great! I'm on a roll!</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I love this shop, Rob! It has everything you need and then things you don't even know you need! &nbsp;Look at this suitcase! Real leather. Very smart. I'm getting the beige one. Take the black one for yourself, Rob.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I can't buy anything at the moment, Feifei. I haven't got any money.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>You should save some money so you can buy things like this. Here - this one is a bit smaller and costs less… Oh, mine is big and luxurious though…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I did save some&nbsp;money but I lent it to a friend last month and I'm still waiting to be paid back.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh, Rob. You shouldn't lend money to just anybody… Oh! I love that handbag too…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Really?! Yes, last month someone came to me and said she needed some cash desperately for the rent.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh… Oh, that's right! It was me… Sorry, Rob. I completely forgot…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well, finally the penny dropped!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Where? Where? You can't be dropping your pennies if you need cash! Let me help you to find them.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>It's not on the floor, Feifei. In English when we say 'the penny dropped' we mean somebody has finally realised or understood something.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well, so let's hear some examples of how this expression is used.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong><em>Susan keeps postponing the wedding, Joe. When is the penny going to drop? She doesn't love you!</em></p> 
<p><em>If your boss doesn't appreciate you, why not leave a job advert from another company on your desk? That will make the penny drop!</em></p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>What an interesting expression. I'll pay you back, Rob. I promise.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Thank you. I'm glad because I want to buy one of these suitcases and they cost a pretty penny.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh! Enough penny expressions for today, Rob. Bye!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Bye bye!</p>

It's fun and – best of all – it's free.</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Hello, I'm Feifei and this is The English We Speak. Joining me is Rob.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Hello everyone.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Did you enjoy Jane and Tim's wedding yesterday?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Yes, it was good wasn't it – especially the party afterwards – all that dancing and drinking.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />I did notice! I'm really happy for them but I do hope that Jane will help Tim change his bad habits – Tim used to be messy, forgetful and always late for everything!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />I don't think he'll change – a leopard doesn't change his spots.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />A leopard doesn't change its spots? I think I know that Rob, but what has a leopard got to do with Tim?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Quite a lot Feifei. The phrase – a leopard doesn't change its spots OR a leopard can't change its spots – means he won't change. He will always be the same person and his bad habits are here to stay.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Oh I see. So his bad habits will never change – they will always stay the same. So Rob, you are comparing a leopard, who can never change its spotty appearance, with someone who will never change the way they behave?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />You've got it. Let's hear some examples of how people use the phrase…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />I told Karen she had to study more if she wants to pass her exams but a leopard can't change its spots – she won't do it.</p> 
<p>Freddie promised he wouldn't get into trouble at school but I don't believe him – a leopard can't change its spots.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />A leopard can't change its spots – and someone can't change their habits. So Rob, you don't think Jane will be able to change Tim?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />No – he's stubborn – maybe he's going to have to change Jane – she is very neat and tidy and always turns up on time – maybe he could teach her to relax more – chill out.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Hmmm – I don't know if she would change either. Rob, could we say a tiger never changes its stripes?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Ha ha – yes we could say that – and it would mean the same thing – in that she won't change. Oh dear, I'm not sure if their marriage is going to last!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />No… or maybe it will. You know what they say? Opposites attract!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Yes they do Feifei, you're right. Bye for now.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Goodbye.</p>"
"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello, it's Feifei and Rob here with today's The English We Speak.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Feifei, keep your eyes on the road! Look where you're going.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>OK, OK! Rob is making me drive around while we present today's programme. Rob, why <em>exactly</em> am I driving my car?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well, I really wanted you to understand the phrase we're going to learn today. But I'm going to leave it all to you.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So what are you going to do then?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh nothing. I'm just going to a take a back seat today. You carry on, I'll just watch.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Take a back seat? Hmmm - so you're going to let me take control - do all the work - while you sit there and watch?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes - look, I'm just sitting here - on the back seat</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh I get it! 'To take a back seat' is an idiom that means to give up control and let someone else take responsibility.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>That's it Feifei. Let's hear from some other people who are 'taking a back seat'…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Mary was happy to take a back seat and let Jim run the meeting.</p> 
<p>I'm going to take a back seat this year and let you decide where we go on holiday.</p> 
<p>Now he's getting older he's decided to take a back seat in running the company.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So, to take a backseat means to choose not to take control and let someone else be in charge. Rob, does this mean you're just being lazy? &nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Of course not, Feifei. It just means I'm letting you have a turn at being in charge - I trust you - although... What are you doing?!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Letting you take the back seat while I show you how to really drive!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Feifei! Watch out for that roundabout... and that traffic light... aren't you driving a bit fast?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Rob - don't be such a back seat driver!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>A what?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>A back seat driver - someone who offers unwanted advice - someone who tells the driver how to drive. But we'll leave that expression for another day!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>OK OK - but you are going really fast - can I take the front seat now?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Stay where you are!</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye.</p>"
"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak with me Rob…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>…and me Feifei. Hello.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>In this programme, we're talking about an expression that's appeared in the age of the internet. And it's connected to social media. So Feifei do you communicate with other people a lot on social media?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, I do. I love chatting with my friends and meeting new people… some people are mean though. They write very negative messages attacking others… it's nasty!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>It is. And it's something we call cyberbullying. That's a form of bullying in which people harass and harm other people online deliberately. And unlike the traditional bully, the electronic bully can remain anonymous. So we don't know who they are.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Cyberbullying includes things like spreading lies and rumours online, sending or forwarding unpleasant messages via instant messaging, text or on social networks.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes. It's becoming very common among teenagers these days. There are campaigns against cyberbullying and some places have adopted laws to prevent it. Let's hear examples of how this expression is used.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Kate is a victim of cyberbullying. It's so bad she doesn't want to leave the house. Someone from school has put messages on social media saying she's ugly and she should die. It's terrible!</p> 
<p>Experts say people should protect themselves from cyberbullying by not taking everything to heart.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well, this last example includes some good advice.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Indeed. Experts advise you not to give out your own or friends' personal information and know how to block or report people who behave in an improper way.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>And when you send messages to people, be careful about what you write and post online. And don't share an unkind personal comment or image. Remember that though you think you have just a computer in front of you, on the other side of the screen there is a real human being.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>So be safe and happy online. Enjoy social media.</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hello, Li.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Hello, Rob.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>On the internet again?</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Yes. It seems we can't survive without spending hours on the computer every day.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hey, have you noticed how many new words and phrases have been created or have changed their meaning thanks to the development of the internet?</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>One thing I'm sure about. If someone tells you they're sending you something via 'snail mail', don't expect to open an envelope and find lots of snails coming out of it.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>And your letters won't be delivered by snails either. It would take years!</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>That's funny when you think about it. Well, not if you are a snail, for sure!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>'Snail mail' is the traditional letter delivering service in which you have a postman and a post box. It's different from email or electronic mail, when the message sent on the computer travels quickly to its destination.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>This is one of the expressions in today's The English We Speak:</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /> </strong><em>I'm sending my auntie Marge this lovely birthday card via snail mail. She lives in Japan.</em></p> 
<p><em>I much prefer using email these days. All I get by snail mail are these marketing leaflets!</em></p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well, the verb 'to post' and the noun 'post' have also gained new meanings in the internet age.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>If you write an opinion on a social media website - you 'post' a comment - your comment is… well, 'a post'!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Before, you had to go to the post office to… post your letters. Here are some more examples of this new meaning of 'post'.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /> </strong><em>This website's all about how trendy it is to wear fur. I don't like it at all. I think I'll post a comment!</em></p> 
<p><em>Mary has a blog about food and she publishes new posts every day.</em></p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>So, there are no snails in your snail mail and… your 'hard copy' is… guess what?</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Not hard at all!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes. 'Hard copy' is what we call the paper version of a document you write on your computer or of a digital picture you take.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Paper is flexible, but the paper document is called 'hard copy'. Let's hear some examples here in The English We Speak.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /> </strong><em>I'll give you a hard copy of my report, Mary. You can read it on the bus, on your way home.&nbsp; </em></p> 
<p><em>I have a digital copy of my wedding picture as a screensaver at work but I much prefer my hard copy in a frame. It's much nicer. </em></p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>There you go. 'Hard copy', 'to post' or 'a post' and 'snail mail', all come about because of computers and the internet!&nbsp; New words and phrases are appearing every day and we have to keep up.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>That's it from us for today. Bye bye.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Bye.</p>"
"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello everyone. Hello Rob. I'm here.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh, hello Feifei. Now... what are you doing here?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>You told me to come by. Here I am and... well, why do you need me here?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well, Feifei, I wanted to... I needed to... well... you had to come here because...</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Because?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I don't know! My mind's gone blank!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>You've forgotten?!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes. When you say 'my mind's gone blank' it means that suddenly you've completely forgotten what you were about to do or say. Here are some examples of how to use this phrase.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I didn't do well in the job interview. When they asked me why I wanted to work there my mind went blank. I wasn't sure why I'd applied for that particular job at all!</p> 
<p>Alan failed the exam. He studied hard but when he got into the classroom to take it he was so nervous that his mind went blank. But he is a good student so his teacher might give him a second chance.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hmmm... that is a useful expression. Sometimes my mind goes blank too. English can be a difficult language. So many words but... well, that's the English we speak...</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes! Yes! That's it! I remember it now!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>What?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I called you here for us to present The English We Speak!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Great, Rob! So I can leave now.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Why do you want to leave?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Because the programme's finished, Rob, it's done. &nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>How come?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>'My mind's gone blank' was today's expression in The English We Speak!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Ah... I see. OK. Bye! &nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Rob </strong></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak from BBC Learning English. I'm Rob.</p>
<p><strong>Helen</strong></p>
<p>Hello, I'm Helen. This is the programme where we try to help you understand language often heard in English conversations.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong></p>
<p>Well, I went to a presentation this morning and I heard a word that made me laugh.</p>
<p><strong>Helen</strong></p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong></p>
<p>See if you can guess, Helen. Let's play a word game. Are you ready?</p>
<p><strong>Helen</strong></p>
<p>Yes I am.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong></p>
<p>OK. Well, It's made up of two words and the first word is a cute little animal.</p>
<p><strong>Helen</strong></p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong></p>
<p>And if you kiss this animal, it may turn into a prince.</p>
<p><strong>Helen</strong></p>
<p>I know this one. If you kiss a frog, it turns into a prince. The first word is 'frog'.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong></p>
<p>Well done. The second word is the type of walk that soldiers do.</p>
<p><strong>Helen</strong></p>
<p>Easy - marching.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong></p>
<p>You got it. I heard the word 'frogmarch' this morning. And do you know what we call a lot of frogs together?</p>
<p><strong>Helen</strong></p>
<p>A school of frogs?</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>Helen</strong></p>
<p>A herd of frogs?</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong></p>
<p>No, it's an 'army' of frogs. I just have this cartoon picture in my mind of an army of frogs all wearing boots and marching down the river.</p>
<p><strong>Helen</strong></p>
<p>Oh that's hilarious. But what does 'frogmarch' really mean? Surely it's not a way of marching.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong></p>
<p>No, 'to frogmarch' means to force someone who is unwilling to move forward or to walk somewhere, often by holding their arms tightly. Here are some examples.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<p>The drunken suspect was handcuffed by the police and frogmarched to the waiting police van.</p>
<p>In major sporting events, if you disrupt the game, you risk being frogmarched out of the stadium by security guards.</p>
<p><strong>Helen</strong></p>
<p>Ouch, that's pretty harsh, isn't it? So how did you hear it used?</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong></p>
<p>The presenter told us that his lecture on social dynamics was a must for everyone and so we either all had to sign up voluntarily or he would frogmarch us there himself.</p>
<p><strong>Helen</strong></p>
<p>Oh, that's a threat.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong></p>
<p>Exactly, so of course we all signed up.</p>
<p><strong>Helen</strong></p>
<p>Very effective. The next time I want full attendance, I'll know exactly what to say.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong></p>
<p>Frogmarching someone? Well, make sure you have enough people to do the job. It usually takes at least two people to frogmarch one person. Bye bye.</p>
<p><strong>Helen</strong></p>
<p>Bye.</p>

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak with me Feifei…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>…and me Rob. Hello. But I'm afraid I won't be here for long Feifei.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Why? What's happened, Rob?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I have so much to do. I have to write some texts, I am presenting this and two other programmes, and … yes, I have to upload material to our website…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>That's a lot to do, and you look stressed.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>And it's not just that… I have to take my son to school, my cat to the vet, buy my wife a birthday present...</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Rob, you need some 'me time'!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes, I do! That would be brilliant! Me time is an expression which means time we have for ourselves to do just what we want. I really do need some me time.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Let's hear some examples of how to use the expression 'me time'.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I've just sent my mum to a spa in the countryside. She's been taking care of the whole family and is really in need of some me time!</p> 
<p>A: Oh, six in the morning! I'm going to be late for work!<br />B: Ignore the alarm clock today. It's Sunday! Stay in bed till late and have some me time.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>You know, Rob, these examples have inspired me so much that I'll let you to have some me time for the rest of the programme.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Really?!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes. What do you like to do to relax?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well… I'd like to …</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>What I'd like, I'd really really like is… to take a nap. And now I'm going to do just that. OK. Thanks Feifei. Bye everyone!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Rob? Rob?... Well, let's give Rob some me time. Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello I'm Feifei and welcome to The English We Speak – and joining me is Rob.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hello everyone.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So Rob, I hear you have a new a hobby?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes that's right – it's very exciting – let me show you…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Arghh! Bees! I don't like them – shut the door! So you're new hobby is bee keeping?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes I'm a bee keeper – and I love it - but there is a sting in the tail.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Of course there's a sting in the tail – bees sting – and it hurts, that's why I don't like bees.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>They only sting when they're angry Feifei – and anyway, when I said 'there's a sting in the tail' I wasn't referring to the bees. I meant something unpleasant comes with something that is meant to be pleasurable.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, as I said – looking after bees means you're likely to get stung.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>That's true – but what I meant was bee keeping is fun but I wasn't expecting it to cost so much money – I had to buy all these hives and these special protective clothes.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, you do look silly! So you're saying bee keeping is fun but the unexpected cost of it is the sting in the tail?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Exactly. Let's hear some examples while I go and get some honey…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>We had a great holiday but it had a sting in the tail – when we got home we discovered our house had been broken into.</p> 
<p>I love her new book – the story is funny and romantic – but there's a sting in the tail when someone dies.</p> 
<p>Yeah, we all got a pay rise this month, but there's a sting in the tail – we're expected to work longer hours.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So that's 'a sting in the tail' – a phrase that means something unpleasant and sometimes unexpected happens when doing something good or fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>OK Feifei, one of the good things about bee keeping is you get this delicious honey – and that's free - go on Feifei, try some.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hmmm honey, delicious!&nbsp; Oh no, you've brought something else with you… it's a bee!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Don't panic – I'll try to catch it… ouch! That hurt.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh dear – it looks like bee keeping has more than one sting in the tail!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Very funny!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Welcome to The English We Speak with me Feifei and... Rob... Rob? Where's Rob?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />(Door opens) Oh hi Feifei... you couldn't lend me &pound;10, could you?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Rob! You're supposed to be presenting this programme. Anyway, what do you need &pound;10 for? And what's that... stuff all over your clothes?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well, I was running to get to the studio and I bumped into a woman.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Right... So, what do you need &pound;10 for?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well, you see, she dropped a big box she was carrying and said I would have to pay for the damage - and if I didn't, her daughter would be really upset!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh! Rob, you are in 'a sticky situation'.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><strong><br /></strong>Well, that's true. You mean I'm in a situation that is difficult to get out of?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><strong><br /></strong>Exactly! Rob, here's &pound;10 -&nbsp;now you can go and un-stick the situation!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob </strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Thanks Feifei. I think we should hear some examples of this phrase while I go and pay the woman...</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I'm in a sticky situation: I said I'd go to the cinema with Pete but I've also promised to go for a drink with John.</p> 
<p>It was a sticky situation - neither side would agree on who caused the accident.</p> 
<p>We're in a sticky situation - we've got to catch the train but we haven't got enough money to buy a ticket.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So a sticky situation is a difficult, awkward or sensitive situation. (Door opens again) Ah, Rob, you're back...</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>...yes. She's happy now and is going back to the bakery again.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>The bakery? Why? What was in that box she was carrying?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>It was a big birthday cake for her daughter.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Oh no - you were in a sticky situation in more ways than one!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I suppose I was.</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Hello and welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Feifei…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />… and hello I'm Rob.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Rob, thanks for giving me a lift home from the station tonight.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />No problem Feifei. Happy to help… and look we're almost home… just turn this corner.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Great - I would have got very wet walking home in this rain.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />That's OK… but I was wondering if you could do something for me now?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Oh! Rob, did you just give me a lift home so that I would do something for you?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Well… err… you know what they say… 'one good turn deserves another'.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />'One good turn deserves another'? Are we talking about driving? There's no need to 'turn another corner', we're already at my house.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />No Feifei – I mean when someone does something to help you, you should do something helpful in return.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Oh, is that right! We had better hear some more examples of this phrase…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />A: Do you mind doing the washing up? I did do all the cooking and one good turn does deserve another!<br />B: Oh, OK then.</p> 
<p>Please can you help me with my homework, I did yours last week and you know what they say: one good turn deserves another!</p> 
<p>He helped me fix my car, so I was happy to let him borrow it if he needed to – one good turn deserves another.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />So one good turn deserves another – do someone a favour and they should return the favour. Hmm, I've been thinking Rob, you're right – you did me a kind favour and I should help you – so how can I help?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Well, if you're sure Feifei – I wondered if you could help me paint my house this weekend?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Help you paint your house?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Not all of it – just the living room, the kitchen, the bathroom and the bedroom.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />That's not fair! Rob, I'm sure one good turn deserves another of equal value – giving me a lift home isn't the same as painting all you house!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Oh, so the answer is 'no' then?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />No! Bye.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Erm… bye. And you can walk next time!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>"
"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello Rob. You look so busy, what are all these papers?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><strong><br /></strong>Oh, Feifei, I have to get a permit to build an extension to my house. It's a very small bit of building work but I have to fill in all these forms.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>What is this one for?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Well, this one here is for my local council. I need to apply for planning permission. And then they want lots of supporting documents to make sure it fits in with building regulations.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><strong><br /> </strong>It sounds exhausting.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>It is. I hate red tape. If I could cut through this red tape it would be brilliant!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So your problem is red tape? Say no more, Rob! The solution is in my bag! Ah, here they are!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>A pair of scissors and blue tape?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes. You use the scissors to cut through your red tape and... if you don't like red tape, use blue. I love the colour blue!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Thank you, Feifei. You're a good friend. But in English we call the rules and processes required to get official permits - which usually seem to be pointless - 'red tape'.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ah, bureaucracy! So let's hear some examples of how this expression is used.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Small firms won't be subject to new regulations under a government plan to cut red tape and boost the economy.</p> 
<p>Andrea almost gave up studying abroad. The amount of red tape to get a visa was unbelievable!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I think most people hate bureaucracy, Rob. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I'm not surprised. Some people say this expression might come from the 16th century, when bundles of documents were held together with red tape. I hate all these forms!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well, it's the 21st century now and we still have red tape. Good luck with your red tape, Rob. I'm off to paint the town red!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh, no more idioms with red for me today please.</p> 
<p><strong>Both</strong><br /> Bye.</p>"
"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to&nbsp;The English We Speak. I'm Rob and joining me today is Helen.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Hello everyone. Hey Rob, I hear you have a holiday coming up soon.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh yes, we booked a trip to China to visit the home of pandas.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Do you mean Chengdu?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I do, yes. We are stopping there for a few days and then to Hong Kong for two weeks.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>You know Chengdu is my home town? I grew up there.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh, I didn't know that. Ha! So you must know the place like the back of your hand.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>The back of my hand? Well I know my hands pretty well, but they are just my hands - very ordinary.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh, it’s a very common expression Helen. We use it to say that we know somewhere very well, or to talk about an extremely familiar place. You hear people say it all the time. Here are a few examples.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>He knows the building like the back of his hand.</p> 
<p>She lived in the village all her life, and knows the area like the back of her hand.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>So, is this phrase only used when talking about places? Or you can use it to talk about other things?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well, it can used to describe things we know very well. It's not just limited to places. Here are some more examples:</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Jenny knows that book like the back of her hand. She has read it at least twenty times.</p> 
<p>Max knows the Bond films like the back of his hand; he could recite the whole script of all of them.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>So Helen, since you lived in Chengdu for many years, have you got any recommendations for good places to visit in Chengdu?</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Actually, the city has changed so much; I would be lost there like any other visitor. But my cousin still lives there. He definitely knows the city like the back of his hand.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well maybe I should give him a call.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>I’m sure he’ll be happy to help.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Great!</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Have a good trip then.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Thanks.</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hi everyone, I'm Feifei, and this is The English We Speak and with me is… is… Rob.<br />Are you ok Rob?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No… I haven't finished writing the script for this programme – I still don't know how it's going to end.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So what! Rob, it's not important.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>What?! A script is not important – how am I going to make this programme word-perfect, without any mistakes? What will the audience think of me?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>At the moment, they probably think you are a little crazy – you're over-reacting Rob – you're making a mountain out of a molehill.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Making a mountain out of a molehill! I won't be making any mountains, I haven't got time.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>No Rob – it's just a saying! The phrase 'to make a mountain out of molehill' means you're making a big issue out of a small issue. You are over-reacting! So calm down Rob – it's not a big issue not having a script, is it?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>[silence]</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Rob?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I don't know what to say – it's not on the script!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh dear – we'd better hear some other examples of this phrase…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I only asked him to do the shopping and now he's going on about how he has no time to go to the pub – he's making a mountain out of a molehill.</p> 
<p>It's only a 2000-word essay - stop making a mountain out of a molehill!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So – making a mountain out of a molehill means making a small problem seem like a big one. And Rob, not finishing a script for this programme is a <em>small</em> problem.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>If you say so Feifei.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Just do what we always do – make it up!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>OK, I'll try – hold on, what's that?</p> 
<p>[DIGGING/SQUEAKING FX]</p> 
<p>Look! A real mole has buried into the studio – so now we have a real molehill to make a mountain out of.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>You would <em>never</em> have written that in a script Rob!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob.<br /></strong>True. Bye!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak with me Feifei...</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>...and me Rob. Hello.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Erm, Rob, are you OK? You've got some cuts on your face.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh well, yes, I've had a bit of a bad morning.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I was cycling into the office and some idiot ran out in the road, right in front of me.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Crikey - did you hit him?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No - but it was a close shave.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> A close shave? Did he have a razor?!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No Feifei - that would have hurt. This is an expression that describes a dangerous or unpleasant situation that has only just been avoided. It almost happened... but it didn't.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Lucky for you! So you're saying you nearly had an accident but you didn't?<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br /> Exactly. Let's hear some more examples of this phrase...</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>We ran to catch the train - it was a close shave but we just managed to get on.</p> 
<p>I had a close shave when a fast car just missed me as I was crossing the road.</p> 
<p>It was close shave but I don't think my mum saw us smoking.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So, a close shave describes a situation where you have a narrow escape from something bad. So you had a narrow escape this morning Rob?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br /> I did. Why don't people look when they cross the road?! I could have ended up falling off my bike and being hit by a bus.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /> </strong>But hold on Rob - if you didn't fall off your bike, why have you got those cuts on your face?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh... these! Well, I had a shave this morning and used a blunt razor.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ouch! So you really did have 'a close shave'!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Ha ha. You're as sharp as a razor Feifei! I mean intelligent or sharp-witted.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Unlike your razor.</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Hi everyone, I'm Li. Rob will be here in a few minutes but while I'm waiting for him I must try to find my Travelcard. I couldn't find it this morning. I hope I haven't lost it.</p> 
<p><em>(Sound of Li emptying her handbag... Then the door opens and Rob enters the room)</em>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hi Li, sorry I'm late.<em> (Rob looks at Li) </em>Li, what are you doing? You've emptied your handbag all over the floor!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Oh, hi Rob, I wasn't expecting you to be here so soon. Oh dear, this must look terrible, but believe me, there's method to my madness.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>You've made a mess all over the floor and you're telling me you've gone mad!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>No, I haven't gone mad, well I hope not! The phrase 'there's method to my madness' means that although what I'm doing looks like madness I'm doing it deliberately; I have a reason for doing it.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I'm only joking Li. Of course I know this phrase. 'There's method to my madness' or you could say 'there's method in my madness', means you are doing something that looks strange but you have a plan and really, you are doing something very sensible.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Yes, that's exactly right. I've emptied my handbag over the floor because it will be easier and quicker to find my Travelcard. Then I'll re-pack my handbag.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>A good idea. That's the phrase for The English We Speak today. Let's hear some examples of how it's used.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I'm driving to my friend's house today but I'm going to take the long route, avoiding the motorway. There's method to my madness, I think the motorway will be very busy and the longer route will be quicker.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A: What are you doing putting all the books on the floor?<br />B: There's method to my madness. I'm taking a photo of the books I'm putting away. The photos will help me locate the books more easily.<br />A: Oh, that's clever.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>So Li, have you found your Travelcard?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Yes, it must have been at the bottom of my handbag. You see, there was method to my madness.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well done Li. Well, I'm going now. I'll leave you to tidy up your mess!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Thanks Rob.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Bye everyone!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Hi, Feifei. I'm glad you've come to watch me train for the pie-eating competition. I'm going to be the new champion! I'm so sure of it – no one's going to beat me, I'm the best!</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>How can you be so sure you are going to win?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Because I love eating.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>But you're so thin. I can't imagine ten of these huge pies fitting inside your skinny body.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Don't worry, they will – I'll eat them all and very quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>So let me start the clock. Are you ready?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Yes!</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Here we go!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Okay. Right, let me try some of these… (eating pies). Lovely! Lovely!</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Well, two down … eight to go.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Okay, a bit more …(eating more pies)</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>That's four now … five and …</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>No! No! I can't eat anymore!</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Yes, I'm full up!</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>If you can't finish these, you're going to have to eat humble pie.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Humble pie? I won't have room for any type of pie. I'm stuffed! But I see what you mean. I have to admit that I was wrong when I said I could eat all those pies.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Yes, in English, when we say someone has to 'eat humble pie', we mean they have to admit they can't do something they boasted about. It's a bit humiliating for them.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Yes. That person then has to act in an apologetic way. 'To eat humble pie' is today's expression in The English We Speak. Let's hear some examples of how it's used.</p>
<p><strong>Examples<br clear=""none"" /> </strong><em>The factory owner had to eat humble pie after a lot of customers complained about his product.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>Peter is so arrogant. He said he could finish the work much quicker than anybody else in the office. I hope he has to eat humble pie. </em></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>So, I can't eat ten pies in a few minutes after all. We still have all these pies, which are very tasty actually. You can have some, Feifei.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Thank you. Mmm, not bad. This is an interesting expression, Rob. I wonder where it came from.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Well, some people say it might have come from 'umbles', which is an old word for animal organs like kidneys, intestines, etc. In the past, rich people might have considered eating an 'umbles pie' as a punishment. But who knows?</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Well, Rob, I don't think eating all those pies is a punishment. We just have to eat one at a time and enjoy each one.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Good idea! Okay. Shall we start now?</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Here it goes. Okay. Bye bye!</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Bye!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Lovely!</p>"
"<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Hello everyone, I'm Li. Welcome to the English We Speak. With me today is Rob.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hello everyone.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Rob, you look worried, what's on your mind?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh, I'm just concerned about a good friend. He's been asking me for advice about saving money.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Well that's very kind of you, but does he have a problem?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>He's one of those people that just can't save money. Every time he gets paid he goes out and spends it all.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>I've heard of people like that. I'd say that money burns a hole in his pocket.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>That's exactly right, money does burn a hole in his pocket. Whenever he has money he has to spend it.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>That's the phrase for the English We Speak today. Let's hear some examples of how people use it.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>A: Why have you never got any money?<br />B: Well, I have a bad habit of spending my money as soon as I get it. Money burns a hole in my pocket.</p> 
<p>A: I find saving money so difficult. I like to buy the latest gadgets.<br />B: The trouble with you is that money burns a hole in your pocket.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>I also have a friend who is tempted to spend every penny.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well, the phrase can also be used in a slightly different way.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>What way?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>If something unexpected costs a lot of money, you can also say 'it's burnt a hole in your pocket'. Let's hear an example.</p> 
<p><strong>Example<br /></strong>A: My daughter is getting married next year.</p> 
<p>B: Oh that's fantastic news.</p> 
<p>A: Yes, it is. But I think the cost of the wedding will burn a hole in my pocket.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>You'd better start saving money now for your daughter.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes, that's right. Well, unless, of course, she marries a rich guy.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Well, fingers crossed. You still look worried Rob. Are you thinking about your friend or your daughter?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh, I'm thinking about friend. I think he might need professional help.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Or maybe he needs a girlfriend, someone who can stop him spending.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No. I think that will just make him spend even more.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>I know, I was only joking. Bye.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Bye bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak with me, Feifei and…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>…and me, Rob. Now excuse me Feifei, I just need to reach over and get a tissue before I….. SNEEZE!&nbsp; Oh excuse me!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Are you getting a cold?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh excuse me, I've just got to get this.&nbsp; <em>Hi mum, I've told you not to call me at work. I'll call you tonight. OK? Bye. </em>Sorry about that.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Err Rob, are you going to do any work?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Excuse me! I am working very hard to explain today's piece of authentic English.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Excuse me? Say that again.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes – that's it – our phrase today is two words with many different meanings – 'excuse me'.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I see – so when you sneeze or make a rude noise you can apologise by saying 'excuse me!'</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Exactly. And when I wanted you to move so that I could reach for the tissues, I said 'excuse me' to politely ask you to move so that I could reach them. A bit like this…</p> 
<p><strong>Example<br /></strong>Excuse me, could you move down the bus please so that I can get on. Thanks!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>And what about that phone call?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Ah yes, I said 'excuse me' as a polite way of apologising for the interruption.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So you were being polite and then you were being rude when you said 'excuse me!'&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I was expressing shock and disbelief that you thought I wasn't working. A bit like this…</p> 
<p><strong>Example<br /></strong>Excuse me! How can you say I don't do any housework – I cleaned the bathroom yesterday.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>And then you said 'excuse me?' because you didn't understand what I said earlier – as usual – and you wanted me to repeat it.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Excuse me! That's not fair. Any other uses?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes. Here's another one…</p> 
<p><strong>Example<br /></strong>Excuse me, do you know the way to the railway station?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>OK, that's 'excuse me' to get someone's attention. Well Rob, now I've got <em>your</em> attention, you'll have to 'excuse me' because I've got to go.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>A very good use of 'excuse me' Feifei – politely saying you have to go. So, can you think of any more…? Feifei? Feifei? Oh she really has gone.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>And I'm Rob. So Feifei, have you got any holiday plans?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes I have actually. Three weeks in Australia.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Australia – wonderful! If I had the money, I'd go there <strong>at the drop of a hat</strong>.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>What? <strong>At the drop of a hat</strong>? Here, take my hat.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Your hat?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, you said you'd go <strong>at the drop of hat</strong>, so here's my hat, now drop it – and then you can go. &nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I wish it was that simple. When I said <strong>at the drop of a hat</strong> I meant 'mmediately'. If I had enough money, I would go to Australia immediately – without delay.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I see. So in other words, you would go to Australia without hesitation.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Exactly. Let's hear some more examples…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>My husband just can't stop spending - he buys clothes <strong>at the drop of a hat</strong>!</p> 
<p>If I knew what to do next, I'd quit my job <strong>at the drop of a hat</strong>. Until then, I'll stay where I am.</p> 
<p>My wife's expecting a baby so I might have to rush to the hospital <strong>at the drop of a hat</strong>.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>To do something <strong>at a drop of a hat</strong> means to do something immediately without even thinking about it. Well Rob, I'll send you a postcard when I get to Australia but it may take a while.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Why's that?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well I'm going skiing in France first.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh, well that's somewhere where you really don't want to drop your hat – it'll be freezing!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So you don't fancy coming with me then?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Skiing? No, that's something I wouldn't do <strong>at the drop of a hat</strong>. I'll think about it. But have fun.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Thanks.</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Hello, I'm Rob…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />… and I'm Feifei and this is The English We Speak.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />So Feifei, what are you doing this weekend?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />I thought I'd do some sightseeing in London – I never get time to see my home city, so that's what I'm going to do.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Good idea. You mean the Tower of London, St Paul's Cathedral, Westminster Abbey…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />….yes and especially Big Ben. I've always wanted to stand underneath and hear the clock strike 12.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Do you know what, I might the do same thing. When you're there, give us a bell and I'll come and meet you.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />'Give us a bell'? There is no way I can give you a bell – do you know how heavy it is?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Errr, I don't want a bell from the clock tower. I just meant, give me a call – on your phone. Give us a bell!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Why didn't you just say that!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />'A bell' originates from the days when phones had a bell that rang when someone called it. So when I say 'a bell', I mean 'a call'. So will you 'give us a bell'?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Let me just think about that, while we hear some more examples…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />When you get there, give us a bell and tell us what it's like.</p> 
<p>Just give us a bell and I'll tell you how to get here.</p> 
<p>After our blind date, he told me to give him a bell but every time I call it his phone diverts to voicemail.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />That's give me – or give us – a bell, meaning phone me! But Rob, you said give US a call – are you going to be with someone else?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />No. In informal English we tend to say 'us' even when there's just one of us – just me. But of course 'us' can mean more than one person.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Right. But this weekend you want me to call you because you'll be on your own and you've got nothing else to do – so you want to spend the day sightseeing with me?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Yes. Just give us a bell and I'll be there.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Hmmm, well sorry I can't – I haven't got your number.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Well, I could give you a bell – what's your number again?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Ah, saved by the bell – sorry, got to go, maybe next time. See ya.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Oh. Bye</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>"
"<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Li…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />And hello, I'm Rob</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />Sorry, I didn't hear that.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />If I just take this head off… can you hear me better now? Hello!</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />That's better but why are you wearing a life-size monkey costume Rob?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Well my friend said I should wear it to his son's birthday party this morning – his son loves monkeys and it would make his birthday really special if he saw one!</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />Well, that's very kind of you Rob – and how did the party go?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Well that's the problem. As you can see, I dressed up like a monkey, travelled across London on the bus and there was no party!</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />Ha ha – no party! It looks like your friend has been 'making a monkey out of you'!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Making a monkey out of me? Yes, that's a very good phrase. You mean he's trying to make me look foolish or to humiliate me.</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />He's certainly done that!<br />Let's hear some examples of the phrase in action…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />Mary made a monkey out me by telling to me to ask her best friend out on a date – she said no!</p> 
<p>My boyfriend's always making a monkey out of himself by getting drunk at parties.</p> 
<p>Sid made a monkey out of Paul by telling him to wear a suit to the party – everyone else was wearing jeans!</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />So 'making a monkey out of someone' is not a nice thing to do. You can also say 'making a fool out of someone'. So Rob, you're angry because he's made a fool out of you?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Yes that's right! This phrase doesn't just apply to people who dress up like monkeys. It can apply to any situation where somewhere has been made to look foolish or ridiculous – like me.<br />But Li, this phrase compares someone to a monkey because monkeys look like they are fooling around. Isn't that right?</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />No. In the Chinese culture, a monkey is seen as a clever animal and is often compared to a clever person.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Oh really? Well, in that case I might wear this monkey costume for a little bit longer. How does it make me look? Clever, smart?</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />Quite smart and quite handsome too.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Oh thank you very much!</p> 
<p><strong>Li</strong><br />Bye.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Bye.</p>"
"<p><em>(Helen bumps into Rob in her local laundrette.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Helen<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Hello Rob. I didn't know I would find you here. I love this launderette. The washing machines are very efficient.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>I hope so. I bought a very expensive washing machine for my house but when I put my clothes in, they ended up dirtier!</p>
<p><strong>Helen<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Well, apparently there's some oil leaking in the motor and it stained all the washing! So I'm trying to wash them again here in this launderette!</p>
<p><strong>Helen<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Oh, I can see all the yellowish stains … This white shirt … it's an expensive, designer one …</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Yes, it is. That was my best shirt. It's probably ruined now! If this stain doesn't come out, I'll sue the washing machine manufacturers! I'll take them to the cleaners!</p>
<p><strong>Helen<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Calm down, Rob! It's the shirt that has to be taken to the cleaners!</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Not exactly, Helen. In English, when we say we're going to 'take someone to the cleaners', we mean we're going to take a lot of money from them.</p>
<p><strong>Helen<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>So you want to ask the company to give you a lot of money – maybe all they've got – to compensate you for the loss of your very expensive shirt.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Yes! I'm very angry with them. Anyway, you can use the phrase in a sports context, too, when one team defeats another one by a large number of points. 'Take to the cleaners' is today's expression in The English We Speak. It used to mean getting money from someone else in a dishonest way but now it can just mean getting a lot of money from someone else.</p>
<p><strong>Helen<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Shall we listen to some examples of how this phrase is used?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Examples<br clear=""none"" /> </strong><em>My husband cheated on me with my best friend! I'm going to get the best divorce lawyer in town and take him to the cleaners!</em></p>
<p><em>My team has the best players and we'll take you to the cleaners in this Sunday's match!</em></p>
<p><strong>Helen<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>No need to sue the company, Rob. Call your washing machine manufacturer and ask them to replace it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>But I'm angry!</p>
<p><strong>Helen<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Don't be. I can take you to the cleaners, but not in the sense of this idiom. I can take you to the cleaners next door – the people who remove stains from clothes. They're very good.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Okay. Well, do you think they might be able to remove this stain?</p>
<p><strong>Helen<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Of course they can. Come on, Rob.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Okay. Come on, take me to the cleaners! Thanks, Helen.</p>
<p><strong>Helen<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>You're welcome. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none"" /> </strong>Bye.</p>"

<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello, this is The English We Speak with me Feifei...<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>And me Rob. Hello!<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So Rob, what's that thing you've got there?<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Oh this? It's a barrel [tapping on wooden barrel]...<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />A barrel?! I see.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>And do you want to know what's inside?<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Not really.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />OK - well, if I just open the lid here you'll be able to hear [Opens lid and sounds of laughing] - funny, isn't it?!<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>[not impressed] You have 'a barrel of laughs' - hmm, and that is supposed to be funny?<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>It's supposed to illustrate today's piece of authentic real English. It's hilarious, isn't it? And do you know what - the phrase 'a barrel of laughs' can be used to describe me - someone who is fun and always joking around.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Really? Someone who is funny is 'a barrel of laughs'? But this doesn't describe you Rob - you're not funny.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Oh? What?! I think we'd better hear some examples of this phrase in action - and I'll show you how funny I really am...<strong>&nbsp;<br /><br /></strong><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I shall miss having John in the office. He was a such a barrel of laughs.</p> 
<p>What a barrel of laughs that bus driver was. He made the long journey much more fun with his funny announcements!</p> 
<p>Since I split up with my boyfriend, life hasn't been a barrel of laughs.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So if someone is a 'barrel of laughs', they are fun - and an enjoyable person to be around.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yeah, exactly&nbsp;- the phrase can also describe a thing such as TV show. But come on Feifei, you have to agree, this barrel full of laughs is so funny! Listen to this! [Opens lid again: laughter].<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hmm, it's a cheap joke but it's not funny. I know what you can do if you want to make me laugh...<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh yes - go on, what is it?<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Why don't you see if you can fit inside the barrel?<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh, right, OK. Well, that sounds like a laugh. OK, then, here goes... [Sound of Rob getting in] ... Alright, I'm in.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Wow Rob - you actually fit in the barrel! That's so funny!<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hey Feifei what are you doing?<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Making you into a real life 'barrel of laughs'<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>That's not funny.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>It's hilarious! See you later.</p>"
"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello, this is The English We Speak, with me Feifei…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>[singing badly] And me Rob. Hello!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Err Rob, what is that terrible noise?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Noise? This is my best singing voice - I need it for my new job.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />You didn't tell me you were leaving the BBC and going to a new job.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I'm not - I've got a new part-time job in the evenings to earn a bit of extra cash [tries singing again].</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Hmm - and this second job involves singing, does it?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Yes, that's right. I'm going to be a cabaret singer in a nightclub. Good news, isn't it?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well, Rob, don't give up the day job!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh - that's an expression which means someone's not very good at doing something and isn't likely ever to be successful at doing it.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Yes - but it's used in a humorous and light-hearted way Rob. Sorry, I was trying to be nice.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />OK. Well, I think we'd better hear some examples of this phrase in action while I continue to practice my singing [starts singing again].</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Oh no!</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I wouldn't give up the day job - you're never going to be an actor!</p> 
<p>Do you really want to be a writer? I've read your first book and my advice is 'don't give up the day job'!</p> 
<p>Don't give up the day job Pete - you're never going to earn a living as a singer!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So 'don't give up the day job' means you should continue doing your normal job, rather than trying to turn your hobby into a career. So Rob, have you got the message?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh yes, I should stick to what I'm good at - so I'll concentrate on doing the day job shall I?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, good idea.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>OK, so why we don't we sing together and entertain our listeners [starts singing]?!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh Rob, perhaps you should give up the <em>day</em> job as well.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh thanks.</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hello, I'm Rob…&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>… And I'm Feifei and this is The English We Speak. Hey, happy birthday for last week Rob.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Thanks Feifei, yes 21 years old – where has the time gone?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Are you sure – you don't act like a 21-year-old.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>What are you saying, Feifei?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei <br /> </strong>Well, errr, look at your clothes – they're not very trendy, they're a bit boring!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Boring?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes… and come on, you're not very youthful.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Youthful?! Just because I haven't got any tattoos – who wants a tattoo anyway, they look silly, don't they? And they damage the skin as well…&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> There you go – old fashioned attitudes – no way're you 21!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br /> So you're saying I am a <strong>fuddy-duddy</strong>?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> A <strong>fuddy-duddy</strong> – that's an informal phrase to describe someone who is boring, dull and has old-fashioned attitudes. Let's hear some examples of this phrase.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Ling thinks I’m an old <strong>fuddy-duddy</strong> because I don’t drive a flashy sports car.</p> 
<p>My dad's a bit of a <strong>fuddy-duddy </strong>- he still listens to music on cassette tapes.</p> 
<p>The bank has lost many customers over the years, probably due to its <strong>fuddy-duddy</strong> image.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So a <strong>fuddy-duddy</strong> is someone who is old-fashioned and sometimes pompous. But Rob, being a <strong>fuddy-duddy</strong> isn't all bad.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh yes? Boring, old-fashioned – how can that be a good thing?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well, you make us all laugh.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes but for the wrong reasons – I'm off.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh dear, it seems like a <strong>fuddy-duddy</strong> doesn't even a sense of humour. Where are you going?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br /> To get a tattoo done.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>It'll hurt. Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei and joining me today is Rob.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Hi everyone. Ah Feifei, what a lovely day it is today.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>What? It's raining. You seem to be in a good mood.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes. I've done all my work and the boss has given me the rest of the day off… so I'm off. Bye.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hold on Rob! Could you at least stay and present this programme?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh OK then. I suppose there's no rush to go shopping and spend the bonus he's given me is there?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh come on Rob. This doesn't sound like our boss. You're telling me a barefaced lie.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Barefaced? No no, this really is my hairy face – look!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>No – the word 'barefaced' can literally mean 'having no beard' but we also use the word to mean 'without any disguise' or 'being deliberately bold and shameless'. So Rob is a 'barefaced liar' because he's obviously telling a lie without any embarrasment. Sorry Rob, I think you're lying but let's hear some more examples of this phrase…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>The company's claim that profits had jumped by ten per cent was obviously a barefaced lie.</p> 
<p>John was at the pub last night bragging about his goal-scoring again – but we all know he's a barefaced liar.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Someone being barefaced means doing something without shame, and Rob – you are being a deliberate and outrageous liar aren't you?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh well, yes, I suppose so -&nbsp;I was doing it to show you how great I am.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well it didn't work – and I'm going to show you my 'bear' face now.</p> 
<p>[BEAR ROAR FX]</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Wow that's a real 'bear' face but at least you haven't got a beard – although if you did have one, maybe you'd look less… fat?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Huh! Barefaced cheek!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Time to go I think. Bye.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hello, I'm Rob…&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>… and I'm Feifei and this is The English We Speak.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Now Feifei, did you try out that new cafe on the way to work today?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, I did – I was really impressed – the new cafe has a great range of food and friendly staff. So have you tried it Rob?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yeah, I've been there twice now – but, well, it's <strong>no great shakes</strong>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong><strong>No great shakes</strong>?! That's the best thing about it, they sell amazing banana milkshakes… mmmm&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No, no, no. I wasn't talking about the shakes – I was referring to the cafe generally – there's nowhere to sit, the queues are long, and they didn't put enough froth on my skinny cappuccino – so it's <strong>no great shakes</strong> – in other words, it's not very good.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh so <strong>no great shakes</strong> is an expression that means it's not very good. So you're not impressed?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br /> I'm afraid not. And <strong>no great shakes</strong> also means 'ordinary' which describes this cafe. Let's hear some more examples of this phrase in action…&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p> 
<p>My sister puts on a good dinner party but she's <strong>no great shakes</strong> when it comes to cooking!&nbsp;</p> 
<p>That new singer has a great voice but he's <strong>no great shakes</strong> at playing the guitar.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The film sequel is <strong>no great shakes</strong> compared with the first one – there was no story and the special effects were awful!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So that's the expression <strong>no great shakes</strong> which means not very good or not very impressive. But Rob, maybe if you <em>did</em> try the banana milkshake it might change your opinion about the cafe? Look, I've got one here…&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Mmmm, thanks, yeah… It's not bad, actually. This is a great shake. OK, well, perhaps I'll give it a second chance…&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Where are you going?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong> <br /> To buy a milkshake!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>You do know they cost four pounds?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br /> What? Four pounds! Yes well, as I was saying, that cafe really is <strong>no great shakes</strong>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>If you say so Rob. Bye.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Bye.</p>"
"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak with me Li…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>…and me Rob. I suppose we had better explain an authentic English phrase then.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Oh cheer up Rob – why are you sounding so miserable?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well I wasn't going to say anything but… well, I've got problems… financial problems.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>I'm sorry to hear that, what's happened?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I had to get my car fixed, I had to get a plumber round to fix a leaking pipe, I received a huge tax bill and then to add to it all, I lost my wallet yesterday – I'm doing my best to keep the wolf from the door.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>A wolf?! You really have got problems if you've got to keep a wolf out of your house!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Not a real wolf. When people say they're trying to keep the wolf from the door they mean they've only just got enough money to survive.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Oh I see! So you just have enough money to eat and live?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes, it's not a good position to be in. Let's hear more examples of the phrase in action…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I'm going to have to sell my car if I'm to keep the wolf from the door.</p> 
<p>It's tough being a student, I study all day then have to do an evening job just to keep the wolf from the door.</p> 
<p>We've only just saved enough money to keep the wolf from the door.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>So if you keep the wolf from the door, you just have enough money to survive. OK Rob, I get it… with all your bills to pay you really are struggling to keep the wolf from the door – so what are you going to do?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I need to ask a good friend to lend me some money.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>You want to borrow some money? You'll need to find a really good friend then?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes a <em>really</em> good friend – like you Li? I know you have some spare cash.</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Sorry Rob, I've just spent that on a <em>really</em> nice holiday.</p> 
<p>(Sound of wolf knocking at the door)</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Huh! What's that?</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>It sounds like the wolf is <em>really</em> at the door. Go on then, here's ten pounds.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>(disappointed) Oh thanks!</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello. I'm Feifei and this is The English We Speak.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>… and hello, it's Rob here. Good weekend Feifei?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Amazing – the weather was great so I went on a trip to the seaside. And you were going camping weren't you?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I was but it turned out to be a bit of a <strong>wet weekend</strong>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei <br /> </strong>Oh no, you mean it rained? That's unlucky, the sun was out all weekend here.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh well the weather was fine – but I didn't go. The car broke down again so I stayed at home, doing DIY <em>all</em> weekend – boring!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So a <strong>wet weekend</strong> doesn't have to involve rain?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br /> Nope. A <strong>wet weekend</strong> means a boring and disappointing time.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />And it doesn't&nbsp;have to be at the weekend either?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br /> Correct. This phrase just means the situation is boring just like a <strong>wet weekend</strong> is. You can also use the expression to describe boring people. Here are some examples…&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>That was a <strong>wet weekend</strong>, my friends were coming to stay but cancelled at the last minute.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My cousin's a bit of a <strong>wet weekend</strong>, he's got no personality and&nbsp;nothing to say.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I had to do my accounts yesterday – it was like a <strong>wet weekend</strong> in a paint factory!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei&nbsp;<br /></strong>So a <strong>wet weekend</strong> describes a boring or disappointing experience or person. Well I'm glad to say that you're not a <strong>wet weekend</strong> Rob – I like your sense of adventure, so when are you going to go camping again?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Next weekend.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei&nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh really. Have you seen the weather forecast?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong> <br /> No.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Rain <em>all</em> weekend…. Oh what's wrong? You have a face like a <strong>wet weekend</strong>!<br /> <br /> <strong>Rob</strong><br /> A face like a <strong>wet weekend</strong>? You mean I look unhappy? Well I'm not, if it rains, I'm coming round to yours for dinner!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh no. Bye.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Helen and joining me today is Sian.</p> 
<p><strong>Sian</strong><br />Hi everyone. It’s nice to take things slowly after the weekend.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Have you been running around a lot?</p> 
<p><strong>Sian</strong><br />Well, I did a 10K charity run with my nephew for his school.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />And how did it go? Were you prepared for it?</p> 
<p><strong>Sian</strong><br />I have to say the kids did much better than me. I was almost the last one to finish the race.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />And how long did that take you?</p> 
<p><strong>Sian</strong><br />Maybe six hours!</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Em. That is slow. What about the young runners?</p> 
<p><strong>Sian</strong><br />They were gone in the blink of an eye.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Do you mean they were fast?</p> 
<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>That’s right. When we say something happens in the blink of an eye, it means 'very fast', 'very quickly'. It’s a common expression in English to give a sense of fast speed. Here are a few examples:</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />My new computer can download a large video in the blink of an eye.</p> 
<p>We were so tired after the party; everyone was fast asleep in the blink of an eye.</p> 
<p>Sarah couldn’t believe that the first two years of university went in the blink of an eye.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />So this expression 'in the blink of an eye' doesn’t only refer to running speed, it can also describe when time goes quickly.</p> 
<p><strong>Sian</strong><br />That’s right. It’s often used when changes are happening very fast. And it can be shortened to 'in a blink'.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />A 70-story skyscraper just rose from the ground in a blink.</p> 
<p>I couldn't believe the transformation in Sarah; she went from a shy sixteen-year-old with braces to an outspoken youth MP in a blink.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Well, in the blink of an eye. We’ve finished our programme.</p> 
<p><strong>Sian</strong><br />That went really quickly. Goodbye.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Goodbye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Sian &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak from BBC Learning English. I'm Sian.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Hi everyone, I'm Feifei.</p> 
<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>What on earth are you looking for Feifei? Why are you taking everything out of your bag?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I'm just looking for a stamp – I know I've got one in here somewhere. I just can't seem to find it.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>A stamp? What do you want a stamp for?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I've written a letter to my family and I want to get it in the post before midday.</p> 
<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>You've written a letter? That's a bit old-school isn't it?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>'Old-school'? Who are you calling 'old-school'? I'm younger than you!</p> 
<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>Yeah but writing letters is quite old-school, you know – it's a bit old-fashioned. Most people just email or send instant messages nowadays.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yeah, but it's so nice to get a real letter in the post! So 'old-school' basically describes something that's from an earlier time - something old-fashioned. Let's hear some examples:</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Woah! That haircut is so old-school!</p> 
<p>You want to go roller-skating tonight? Man, that's so old-school!</p> 
<p>Our new teacher is a bit old-school in his approach, but he always gets good results.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So 'old-school' is used as a bit of an insult, right?</p> 
<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>No, it doesn't have to be. It can also be used a compliment – to talk about something from the past that you admire. Or to describe something you feel nostalgic about.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I love your new coat – it's so old-school!</p> 
<p>Look at these old-school computer games, aren't they awesome?!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Exactly, I think it's a good thing to be old-school. If only I could find that stamp.</p> 
<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>Why don't you just fax it?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Well, that really would be old-school Sian. Get with the times!</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei and joining me is Sian. If she ever arrives. Where is she?</p> 
<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>Hi everyone. Sorry I'm late Feifei.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>That's OK, you're here now. How was your trip to France?</p> 
<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>The holiday was lovely thanks – but it's not so great being back! I've returned to a shedload of emails. That's why I'm so late.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>A 'what' load of emails? – did you forget how to speak English on your holiday Sian!?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>Of course not! 'A shedload' just means 'a lot'. So, 'a shedload of something' is 'a very large amount or number of something'.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hmmm, so I can say 'I've got shedloads of money'?</p> 
<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>Yes – that's right. Lucky you! We can also use the singular form 'a shedload', as in 'you've got a shedload of money'. Let's hear some more examples.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Jim gets paid shedloads of money, so don't worry, I'm sure he can afford it.</p> 
<p>We don't need to go out for dinner tonight; we've got a shedload of food in the fridge!</p> 
<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>We can also use 'shedload' or 'shedloads' without 'of' if it's clear what we're talking about. Like in these examples.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>He spent shedloads on his new car.</p> 
<p>I can't go anywhere. I've got shedloads to do today.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Great, so shall we go and get some lunch now?</p> 
<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>I told you I've got all those emails to get through.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes - but you've got shedloads of time! There's no rush.</p> 
<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>OK, but as you've got shedloads of money, you're paying!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I didn't say that.</p> 
<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>Yes you did, you said it a few minutes ago – we all heard you!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>But it was just an example… Oh never mind. Come on - lunch is on me!</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Hello and welcome to The English We Speak from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Hello, I'm Helen. Neil, can I ask you about something?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Yeah, sure. What’s on your mind?</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Well, Theodora and Alma are my best friends, but they are not talking to each other because of a straw.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />They are not getting on because of a straw? Are you sure you heard it right?</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Yes, Alma said to me when Theodora didn't come to her party, it was the last straw. I don't understand. What could a straw do?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Oh, Alma was just using an expression. What she really meant was, things were not going well between them because of things that had happened in the past.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Well Theodora did miss quite a few of our gatherings.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />When Theodora didn't come to Alma's party, that was the final thing that made Alma really angry, giving up on their friendship.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Oh, I see, so the last straw means the last thing or event that caused the total melt down.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />That's right, we often hear the phrase 'the last straw', when people are talking about repeated problems or issues that aren't getting better, then the smallest thing happens, people finally lose their composure and explode.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />I see.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Let’s hear how it's used.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />A: I've never seen you so angry.<br />B: I have had such a bad day. I woke up late and rushed out of the house, then missed my bus by seconds, got in to work and was told there would be no pay rise this year. When the dinner lady said I put too much salad on my plate, it was the last straw.</p> 
<p>The paper factory has struggled to stay open in the last few years; the new tax charge was the last straw, forcing it to shut down after 30 years in business.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Just so you know. Some people also say 'the final straw', and it means the same as 'the last straw'.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Thanks for the clarification. I do hope my friends can resolve their differences. Friendship is worth saving.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Absolutely.</p> 
<p><strong>Both</strong><br />Bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Hello and welcome to The English We Speak – I'm Feifei…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />And hello, I'm Rob.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Hey Rob, have you seen Finn today?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Yes, I saw him just a few moments ago… same old Finn.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />But when I saw him he was very cheerful… smiling and he was singing too!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Nothing wrong with singing at work.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />I know… but he just seems…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Full of the joys of spring?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Full of the joys of spring? Erm, I don't think so – it's winter Rob – cold and wet.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No Feifei! The season might be winter but Finn's behaviour, or his mood, is cheerful and lively –&nbsp;like springtime – you know, bright, sunny, flowers growing, new animals being born, birds flying around…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Mmm... that does sound like spring. It's a nice phrase. It means someone is happy?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Happy – that's right. Shall we hear some more examples?</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />Emily's full of the joys of spring today – her boyfriend has just asked her to marry him!</p> 
<p>Raj seems full of the joys of spring today – he must have some good news about his exam results.</p> 
<p>I'm full of the joys of spring today – I've just won &pound;1,000 in the lottery – now, what shall I spend it on?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />So if someone is full of the joys of spring they are in a good mood. So Rob, why is Finn in such a good mood?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />He's happy because he's going on holiday tomorrow – swapping our cold winter for two weeks in the sun, on the beach in Thailand!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Lucky Finn! But hold on Rob… there's a strike at the airport tomorrow. All flights are cancelled. Does he know that?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />I don't think so. Shall we tell him?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />I don't know. That will make him 'empty of the joys of spring'…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>…and full of the misery of winter!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Is that another idiom?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />No, I just made that one up. Come on, I'll go and tell him.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Bye.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello, I'm Neil…&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>… and I'm Feifei and this is The English We Speak.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Do you know someone asked me for an autograph the other day?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Your autograph!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes, they thought I was someone famous – which of course, I'm not.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well you are sort of famous – being a presenter of The English We Speak.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Oh yeah! Maybe I am. People want to take a selfie with me, buying me presents, me at the Oscars winning awards, fans everywhere, cameras flashing…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Neil, Neil wake up – I think he's daydreaming. Don't get carried away. You know if you <em>were</em> famous, you'd get lots of public attention – <strong>it</strong> <strong>comes with the territory</strong>.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>You're right Feifei – the paparazzi would be following me everywhere – I wouldn't like that – but you used a good phrase there – <strong>it comes with the territory</strong>.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Yes. When something <strong>comes or goes with the territory</strong> it means it's something that is expected as part of the position or situation.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Let's hear some examples…&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong></p> 
<p>The job involves a lot of travelling, but I guess that <strong>comes with the territory</strong>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If you're gonna play rugby, you're gonna get hurt – injuries <strong>go with the territory</strong>!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So the expression <strong>it comes with the territory</strong> means something is to be expected as part of a certain situation. Let's face it Neil, perhaps it's a good thing that we're not famous.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>I guess so. I'll just carry on teaching English and making tea for everyone.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well in our job, tea making <strong>comes with the territory</strong>.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong> <br /> You're right – I think I'll go back to daydreaming. Bye.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Bye.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>And I'm Neil.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>In this programme, we're talking about… 'about'!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>About 'about'?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>About 'about'!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>This is getting silly! We are indeed talking about the word 'about' – but not as it's usually used.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Indeed. Let's demonstrate. Is Mark about today?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes, I saw him this morning.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So – when I asked: &quot;Is Mark about today?&quot; I wasn't asking if Mark was somehow related to the concept of 'today' I just meant 'Is Mark here'?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>'About' means 'here', or 'somewhere near here'.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Mark's about. Mark's near here. By the way, who's Mark?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>No idea. But I know he's near here!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well, that's reassuring. Time for some more examples about 'about'.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Hi, is Sue about? Just need to give her some files.</p> 
<p>Will you be about this evening? I want to ask a big favour.</p> 
<p>There's no one about. It's a bit scary.</p> 
<p>Don't talk like that. There are children about.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>There we are. 'About' meaning in or close to an area.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>You know, there's another word that behaves like this.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>You're talking about… 'around'!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Indeed. We could ask: &quot;Is Mark around?&quot;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>And we know the answer to that: you saw him this morning.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Except… you didn't really see him did you? Because Mark doesn't exist…</p> 
<p><strong>Mark<br /></strong>Hi – I'm Mark.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Ah, Mark!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>We were just talking <em>about </em>you!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>We were just talking about 'about'.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>And 'around'.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil, Feifei, Mark<br /></strong>Bye.</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello, I'm Feifei and it's time again for The English We Speak and with me today is Rob…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hello everyone!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Rob, what is that awful smell of fish?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Ah, you mean these smoked kippers?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Smoked kippers? Why have you got smoked kippers in the studio?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>To illustrate today's phrase. And this long pan is a kettle. It's not the thing you boil water in.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh right. So what is the fish-related phrase then?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>The phrase is <strong>a different kettle of fish</strong> – we say it to mean a situation or subject that is being discussed is completely different from the one you are talking about.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>A strange phrase indeed. So we could say writing English is <strong>a very different kettle of fish</strong> from speaking it?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes, we can – it means it's a different thing - let's hear some more examples…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I loved the first film but the sequel was<strong> a different kettle of fish.</strong></p> 
<p>Heating a ready meal in the microwave is one thing but preparing a freshly cooked meal is <strong>a different kettle of fish</strong>.</p> 
<p>Camping on the beach would be amazing but camping in the rain would be <strong>a different kettle of fish</strong>!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So, when something is a different kettle of fish it means to be completely different from something or someone else that has been talked about. I've got it Rob!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Good. You can also say <strong>to be</strong> <strong>another</strong> <strong>kettle of fish</strong>. So then Feifei, how about coming round to my house and eating some of this fish?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Rob, going to your house is one thing but trying your cooking is <strong>a different kettle of fish</strong>!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Don't you like fish?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Fish is ok – it's your cooking that isn't.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I shall eat alone then! Come on fishy-wishys...</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Neil Neil Neil Neil Neil...</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>And I'm Feifei Feifei Feifei Feifei... What is going on on on on on? It sounds like we're in an echo chamber chamber chamber chamber.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>And that, Feifei, is our expression in this The English We Speak. Now, if you say something in an echo chamber, what happens?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /> </strong>You hear the same thing back again again again again...</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Exactly. An echo chamber is a room designed to create an echo – usually as an effect in an audio recording or a film. But it has a modern use which describes a situation where people only hear, see or read opinions they agree with.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> I see. Just like an echo, they only hear the same thing they've just said.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>That's right. Let's hear some more examples of echo chamber used in this way.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Social media's a dangerous echo chamber – you never get a variety of opinion because all your friends think the same way.</p> 
<p>A: How on earth did SHE win The Z Factor? Literally no one liked her on my social media feed.</p> 
<p>B: Yeah well you should try moving away from your echo chamber and listening to people who don't agree with you!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Echo chamber. A situation in which people only hear their own opinions repeated back to them.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>It's often used as a criticism of social media. Because people choose their friends and follow things they already like, their opinions don't get challenged. So you only hear things you agree with with with with with with...</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes…</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Bye bye bye bye...</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Bye bye bye bye...</p>"
"<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Hello, I’m Finn.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hi, I’m Feifei. Sorry I’m late - Peter and Dave are having an argument in the kitchen. I was trying to calm them down.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Oh, really? What are they arguing about?</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Something about who spilled the milk - it was getting very heated.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Oh, no. Who started the argument?</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hmm, I don’t really know, I think it’s six of one, half a dozen of the other.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Good expression, Feifei.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Thank you, Finn. I learnt this phrase just the other day. I think I can use it in this situation, can’t I?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Yes, indeed you can. We normally use ‘six of one, half a dozen of the other’ when we think there is very little difference between two choices. We also use it when two people are equally responsible for something. Now, let’s hear some examples.</p>
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>
<p>A: I don’t know whether to give my mum flowers or chocolates for Mother’s Day.</p>
<p>B: It’s six of one, half a dozen of the other.</p>
<p>A: Do you think we should take the third ring road instead of the second ring road?</p>
<p>B: Oh, I don’t know, it’s six of one, half a dozen of the other.</p>
<p>A: They keep blaming each other - whose fault was it really?</p>
<p>B: Oh, it was six of one, half a dozen of the other.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So remember you can use ‘six of one, half a dozen of the other’ when two choices are very similar and it doesn’t really matter which one you choose.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Yes, that’s right. Ah, sorry Feifei, wait a sec, I need to go now.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>I’m going to dinner with Sophia. Quick, help me decide – should I wear this blue shirt? Or this pink one?</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>You know what I am about to say, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>The pink one?</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>No, they are very similar. It’s six of one, half a dozen of the other…</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Oh, you’re not helping! I’m off, bye.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Wait…</p>"
"<p><strong>Dan</strong><br /> Hello and welcome to The English We Speak from BBC Learning English, I'm Dan and with me is Feifei.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello.What are all these cds and records for Dan?</p> 
<p><strong>Dan<br /></strong>I’m trying to make a mash-up. It’s going to be so cool.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>A mash-up? What’s that?</p> 
<p><strong>Dan<br /></strong>You know, when you combine two or more existing pieces of media to create something new. You get them all the time on YouTube. My mash-up is going to be a song.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh I see. I think I saw one or two online. Someone had taken a bunch of old movie trailers and mashed them up to create a new one.</p> 
<p><strong>Dan<br /></strong>Yes, that's it. They’ve become very popular recently. And it doesn’t have to be a song or movie, people mash-up everything…even pictures and books!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Let's hear some examples.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p> 
<p><strong>A: </strong>Wow, great new track! Who made it?<strong><br /> B: </strong>It’s a mash-up that I got online. I didn’t know you could mix jazz and rock!</p> 
<p>So I’ve got these two great pieces of film. One’s a romance and one’s a horror film. I’m going to mash them up to make a romantic horror!</p> 
<p><strong>Dan</strong><strong><br /> </strong>A mash-up. A new combination of two already made pieces of material.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So what will your mash-up be, then?</p> 
<p><strong>Dan<br /></strong>I’m combining punk, reggae and military band music. Tell me what you think. Listen!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>It’s certainly very….interesting. Maybe don’t quit your day job just yet?</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p> 
<p><strong>Dan<br /></strong>Oh! Wait! This is the best part!</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei<br /> </strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>…and I'm Rob.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Rob… are you in a rush to go home today?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br /> Err no Feifei. Why, do you want to go for a drink?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Well sort of. A friend of mine is visiting and I'd like to go for a drink her. You could join us later if you like? &nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br /> Oh I see! I've got your number!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Err yes – you have – so you can call me and meet us later. OK?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br /> No – I mean I know what you're trying to do. You want to go to the pub now and leave me to present the rest of this programme?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Well…&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I know what you're up to! Well you can't go until we've heard some more examples…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>So I'll cook and you wash up? Hmm, I've got your number; you're just going to watch TV all evening.</p> 
<p>You can't fool me, I've got your number – you're never going to pay me back.</p> 
<p>Watch out, he's got your number – he knows what you're up to.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>OK Rob – if you say 'I've got your number' it means you understand what someone it trying to do or why they are behaving in a certain way.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Exactly – it's not about having your telephone number. I knew when you asked me if I was rushing home you were after something.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>What - so I could sneak out early to go for a drink? Honestly, who do you think I am?!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Well it sounded like you were planning something… but maybe I misunderstood you. You wouldn't leave me here alone, would you, Feifei? Feifei? Feifei? Oh she's gone. Now where did I put her phone number… Bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei and joining me today is Rob…. Errr Rob, wake up!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh yeah hi everyone.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>What's wrong Rob?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>It's the kids. My house is a mess – toys, pencils, paints everywhere - and I've been trying to get them to clear everything up.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>And I guess you haven't been successful?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>That's right. I shouted at them until I was blue in the face – but the house is still a mess.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Rob, you don't look blue to me – just your normal colour.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I know that – what I mean is, I'm wasting my time because it won't happen – whatever I say I won't get the result I want…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>… which is a tidy house. Hmm, so saying something 'until you're blue in the face' means telling someone something is a waste of time because nothing will happen or change.</p> 
<p>Oh dear Rob, it sounds like you have no control over your kids.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>You're probably right. But I'm not alone - let's hear some other people who are 'blue in the face'…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I've told him to get here on time until I'm blue in the face but still he continues to arrive late.</p> 
<p>He told her not to break the speed limit on the motorway until he was blue in the face but she still did it and guess what? She got a speeding ticket!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So saying 'until I'm blue in the face' means even though you keep saying something, nobody will listen to you. I know what that's like Rob.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Really?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes. Every time you make me a coffee I always ask you to put two sugars in it – but you never do!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Err, pardon Feifei? Sorry I wasn't listening. I'm so tired.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Why are you so tired Rob? All you did was ask the kids to tidy up.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes but because they didn't listen to me, I had to tidy everything up.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Actually I can see that… you really are blue in the face – look you've got blue paint there…and there… and there…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Arghhh! Those damn kids!</p> 
<p><strong>Feiefi<br /></strong>Calm down Rob. Your face is turning red!</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei and joining me is Sian.</p> 
<p><strong>Sian &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Hi everyone.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Are you OK Sian?</p> 
<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>Yes, of course I am! Can we just get on with the programme?!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Um Sian, have you had your breakfast today?</p> 
<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>No I haven't. I overslept and then the bus was late and, uh, it's just not been a good day so far!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hmmm, maybe we should do the programme once you've eaten something. Here have this chocolate bar.</p> 
<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>Oh I'm sorry, I know I'm a bit hangry this morning. I do tend to get moody when I don't eat. My husband's always complaining about it!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hangry? Don't you mean 'angry'?</p> 
<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>No, 'hangry'. 'Hangry' describes someone who is angry – or irritable – as a result of being hungry. Like me today – I'm feeling a bit annoyed because I haven't eaten breakfast!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>You certainly are! So 'hangry' is a combination of 'angry' and 'hungry'?</p> 
<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>Yes, that's right. Let's hear a few examples.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>A: This food is taking forever to arrive. I'm not coming to this restaurant again.<br />B: Oh dear, someone's getting hangry! Let's get you some food quickly!&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My boyfriend is a nightmare whenever he misses a meal; he gets so hangry!</p> 
<p>People tend to get a bit hangry when their blood sugar level drops.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Interesting. You wouldn't catch me getting 'hangry' though, I'm always very chilled.</p> 
<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>Is that right Feifei? You know, I'm feeling much happier after eating that chocolate bar. Shall we do the programme again? I feel ready now.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>No! come on that will do. I'm starving!</p> 
<p><strong>Sian<br /></strong>Oh dear, it seems like you're a bit hangry too Feifei! Let's get you to the cafe now.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Good idea! Let's go.</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Hello, Feifei. Already here, I see, to present The English We Speak.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Actually, I haven't left the studio for a while, Neil. I need to go and eat something. Could you let me off the hook please?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Come on, Feifei, you have to present the programme with me. And today's expression is…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />I need to go to the toilet. Could you let me off the hook?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />In English, to let someone off the hook means to free them from an obligation. You want to be let off the hook, don't you? You don't want to present the programme today.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />It can also mean to release someone from a difficult situation. I do need you to let me off the hook.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Let's hear some examples of how the expression 'to let someone off the hook' is used.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />I haven't studied much but my teacher let me off the hook today. She's decided to postpone the test as long as I hit the books this week.</p> 
<p>The team's supporters didn't let them off the hook. They booed the players off the pitch after they were beaten four-nil.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />That's it then Feifei. You're off the hook now.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />No, I'm not.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Why not?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />My woollen jumper is caught on this hook on the wall just behind me and if I move I'll ruin it. Could you…</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Yeah! Why didn't you say? Let me help you.</p> 
<p>(Neil moves to release Feifei's jumper.)</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Oh be careful. I don't want it ripped!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />I am being careful here… ah… yep, there you go now you're free. You're off the hook in every sense!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Thanks, Neil.</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello, I'm Neil…&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>… and I'm Feifei and this is The English We Speak.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>What's in that bag, Feifei?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh this – it's a box of the best washing powder there is – Dazzlebright non-bio washing powder!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>And why will I need that?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well, at the meeting earlier – when John suggested we all wore suits to work – you said his idea <strong>won't wash</strong> with the team – so here's some washing powder to help you make it wash.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>It's a kind thought – but I won't need it. When I said <strong>it won't wash</strong> I meant his idea is unconvincing and won't work.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Ah – So you don't need my washing powder then?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> No thanks. You see, this phrase originally referred to <em>fabrics</em> that were not good quality and wouldn't last long when they were washed. But now it's about someone's <em>idea</em> or suggestion not lasting very long because people won't believe it or accept it.</p> 
<p>Let's hear some examples…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p> 
<p>Your excuses for not finishing your essay <strong>won't wash</strong> with me – you've missed your deadline and that's that.</p> 
<p>The boss's idea to work an extra hour everyday <strong>won't wash</strong> with the team – they'll be furious.</p> 
<p>Just saying you've got a cold <strong>won't wash</strong> with your fans – they've paid a lot of money to come and see you perform.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>That's the expression <strong>it won't wash</strong> which really means it won't work – or nobody will believe you. Of course, I do know this phrase Neil.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So why did you bring in the washing powder?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well I know how scruffy our team members are – and if we do have to start wearing suits, they will all need a good wash. Erm, did you have curry last night?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong> <br /> Yeah – why do you ask?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>There's a big yellow stain on your jumper – just there. Here, why not test out my Dazzlebright washing powder – 'it makes your old clothes look like new!'</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Hmm, thanks.</p> 
<p><strong>Both</strong><br /> Bye.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>"
"<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Welcome to The English We Speak with me Rob and …. oh… oh… Feifei… Feifei, where are you?</p>
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Hi… hi… over here… come quickly.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Oh… oh… what seems to be the problem?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />I think there's been a murder!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />What?! Really – a murder, here? How can you be so sure?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Well, last night I was speaking to my friend and we were talking about Jenny from our office…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Oh yes Jenny, I haven't seen her around for a while … so?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />My friend said Jenny has probably met someone, got married and moved to Australia – but then she said something very strange, she said it was 'a stab in the dark'.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />'A stab in the dark'? Ha - so you think she’s been murdered?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Well possibly – she hasn't been seen for a long time and then someone was stabbed – and in the dark – so she must have been murdered at night. Oh dear, I think we should call the police!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />No, don't call them yet. That phrase isn't as bad as you think. There's not been a murder. When you say you are 'taking a stab in the dark' it means you don't really know the truth and you are just guessing.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Really? Oh phew. That is good news.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Ok. Let's hear the phrase in action…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br /><em>It might be a stab in the dark but I think my football team is in a good place to win the league this season.</em></p> 
<p><em>I don't know how many people came to see the show, but I'll take a stab in the dark and say about 300.</em></p> 
<p><em>John thought we could sell our old car for &pound;500 – but really he was taking a stab in the dark!</em></p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />So the phrase 'to take a stab in the dark' does not involve stabbing people! But Rob, if we're not sure what did happen to Jenny, it’s still a bit of mystery.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Well maybe she didn't move to Australia… maybe she just got a new job… but I'm just taking a shot in the dark.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />A shot in the dark! Now you're talking about her being shot in the dark?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />No no no no - a shot - or a stab in the dark means the same thing – it means I'm guessing – I don't really know.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Well guess no longer – look, here she comes!</p> 
<p><strong>Jenny</strong><br />Hello you two.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Jenny!</p> 
<p><strong>Jenny</strong><br />Why are you looking so worried – has someone died?!!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Bye!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Bye bye!</p>"
"<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />&nbsp;Hello and welcome to The English We Speak from BBC Learning English, I'm Neil and with me is Feifei.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /> </strong>Hello. You seem a bit tired Neil. Late night?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Yeah I had to go to this old university reunion thing - which was fine - but by the time all the goodbyes and air kisses were over it was really late.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Air kisses? You were kissing the air?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> You know, those kisses people give each other where their lips never actually touch each other's? They just make the noise.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Ah yes I know. When you meet up with people you know at a social event and to greet and say goodbye you pretend to kiss.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> That's it. Usually you touch cheeks on either side and make a kissing noise but the lips never touch. Sometimes the cheeks don't touch either. And that is an air kiss.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> Let's hear some examples.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I always feel so awkward at parties. I hate all those air kisses and small talk. Urgh, so phoney!</p> 
<p>Charles, so wonderful to see you, mwah! Mwah! Charles?! No lips, please. Let's stick to air kisses.</p> 
<p>Woman: So, go on, tell me - did you kiss her?<br />Man: Well, I air-kissed her. Does that count?<br />Woman: No it does not!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> An air kiss. A type of greeting and farewell between friends at social events.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> A kiss in which the two people's lips do not touch!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> That's it – cheek to cheek and a big kissing noise into the air. Mwah! Shall we end with an air kiss to our audience? After all, they are our friends.</p> 
<p><strong>Both</strong><br /> Bye! Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello I'm Feifei and this is The English We Speak.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>And hello I'm Neil.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Neil, I wonder if you could help me. I'm trying to find something on this map.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Oh yes, map reading – I'm good at that. What are you trying to find?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well, I went to a gig last night and saw this new singer – he was amazing.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Thanks for inviting me! Anyway, what's that got to with a map?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Well, afterwards everyone was talking about it and saying the gig was so good that it will 'put him on the map'. But… I just can't find him on here.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Put the map away Feifei – you won't find him there. When we say someone will be 'put on the map' it means they will become famous or become more prominent – but not on a map!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Right! Actually Neil, I've heard about a new restaurant I ate at being 'put on the map'.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes, <em>something</em> as well as someone can be put on the map – or in other words, become famous, popular or well known. You must have eaten at a good quality restaurant for it to be put on the map!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>I did! Let's tuck into some examples shall we?</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Her first exhibition at the Tate gallery has put her on the map as a serious modern artist. .</p> 
<p>This great tasting food has really put this new restaurant on the map.</p> 
<p>Hosting the Olympics has put this city on the map as a great place to come for a holiday.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So that's to put someone or something on the map – to become famous, popular or more prominent. I suppose it suggests that becoming famous means you are now important enough for your name to be seen or heard by everyone.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>That's right. In the old days when a place was too small and unimportant it wasn't shown on a map – but when it became more important it was 'put on the map'.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Right. Anyway Neil, let me look at that map again…</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>OK.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Look! That singer I saw really is on the map – right there.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Really? What was he called?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>'Man-chester'</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Manchester. Of course!</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye.</p>"
"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to Authentic Real English. I'm Helen and joining me today is Neil.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></strong>Hello everyone. You know my friend Jeff the documentary maker?</p> 
<p><strong>Helen</strong><br />Oh yeah.<br /><br /><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well he had this great story he was about to make a film about - the most expensive wedding in the UK. </p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>So what happened? Has he finished it?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>He was due to film the wedding on Saturday. Then yesterday, he got a call from the bride.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Don't tell me the wedding is off. &nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>It is. After all that hard work, everything just went down the pan.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Went down the pan? What pan? </p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>It's an expression we use informally to say something disastrous has happened. It's not the cooking pan we are referring to here. It's actually the toilet!</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>The toilet! Oh yuck!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Just imagine, when you flush the toilet, everything gets washed down the pipe. That's what I mean – 'down the pan', everything's gone! Total disaster! Here are a few examples:</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Jason had great dreams of becoming a football player, but they went down the pan when he broke his leg.</p> 
<p>I'm afraid all that careful preparation we did for Jemma's surprise birthday party went down the pan when her brother told her about it.</p> 
<p>He was ready to move into his new home, but everything went down the pan when the fire destroyed the house last night.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>I get it. If things are going completely wrong and a lot of effort is wasted we can use the phrase 'down the pan'.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>That's right. Er, Helen, I think you forgot to press the record button on this programme.</p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Oh no. What a disaster. Neil, would you mind re-recording this?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>(Sigh). Helen, that's my tea break down the pan.</p>"
"<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hello, I'm Rob…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>… and I'm Feifei and this is The English We Speak.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>So it should have been Neil presenting with you today but he's gone on holiday so you've got me instead.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes I know – Neil's on holiday for two whole weeks!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Oh lucky Neil. Two weeks doing nothing - sitting on the beach in the sun, eating ice-cream. Wonderful!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei <br /> </strong>Oh Neil won't be sitting on any beaches. He's going to help teach English at a school in Spain.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>What! He's gone to Spain to do the <em>same</em> work he does here – that's a bit of a busman's holiday.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>But his job isn't driving buses Rob.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br /> No Feifei – a busman's holiday is a holiday where you do the same thing you do at work instead of just having a rest.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br /> I see. A busman's holiday is not about going on a bus. It's a strange choice for Neil isn't it Rob?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br /> It is but he's not the only one – listen to these examples…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>The taxi driver said he was going on a driving holiday around Europe – it sounds like a busman's holiday to me!</p> 
<p>My mini-break turned into a bit of a busman's holiday when I had to use my plumbing skills to fix a leak in the hotel.</p> 
<p>I decided to take a break from playing in the band and go on holiday but it turned into a busman's holiday when I ended up busking to raise enough money for my plane ticket home.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So that's a busman's holiday, where you go on holiday to do the same or similar work that you do at home. If I went on holiday, doing my job would be the last thing I'd do.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes me too but think about what Neil actually does in his job….</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>He drinks tea… sits around chatting… goes shopping…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong> <br /> Exactly – and he'll be doing the same in Spain.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Now that sounds like my kind of busman's holiday! When can I go?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br /> Let's finish the programme first.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>OK. Bye!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br /> Bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Hello and welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Feifei…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />…and hello, I'm Rob. Now Feifei, I've got a confession to make…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />OK, so what is this confession?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Well, I haven't chosen a piece of authentic real English to explain today.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Oh. Do you have any choices?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Well here is the list of phrases… have a look, what do you think?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Hmmm, let me see…. Shall we take 'pot luck'?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />'Pot luck' – So you mean one at random and see what happens?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />No, I mean let's pick 'pot luck' as a phrase – look, it's there on your list.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Feifei you are a genius. You have just explained an authentic English phrase – job done.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Don't sound so surprised!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Well our phrase is pot luck which describes a situation in which one must take a chance that whatever is available will prove to be good or acceptable.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Yes, pot luck describes a situation that isn't planned or prepared, you just take a chance and hope that the result will be good or acceptable. Let's take pot luck Rob and hope these examples will show this phrase in action…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />We didn't know which restaurant to eat at, so took pot luck and chose the one recommended in the guide book.</p> 
<p>If you can't decide which book to pick, take pot luck, I'm sure they'll all be good to read.</p> 
<p>I'm going to take pot luck, and I'm sure the course I choose will be the right one for me.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />So if you take pot luck at something, you take a chance that whatever is available will prove to be good or acceptable. It's a bit like presenting this programme with you Rob!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Not exactly Feifei – I am the only presenter available so you don't get any choice about who you present with – there is no luck involved.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />True – that's not pot luck, that's bad luck – is that on your list of phrases?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Let me have a look… no, but next time let's choose our English phrase before we come to the studio so we won't be taking pot luck anymore.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Yes let's. See ya.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Bye.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>"
"<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Rob and joining me today is Feifei.</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello everyone. Hey, what about that new guy who's started in the office?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Brian?</p>
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, he's very funny – always telling jokes – and yesterday he started juggling with three oranges – he was very good.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hmm, he might be funny but I haven't seen him do much work – I think he's a bit of a wild card.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>A wild card? You mean he's like a playing card – a heart, a spade or maybe a diamond?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>No, no, although the expression does come from playing cards – here, it means he is unpredictable: he's someone we don't know much about so we're not sure how he's going to behave in the future.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh do you think so? Well yes Rob, Brian is unpredictable!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Let's hear some more examples of this phrase…<br /><br /><strong>Examples<br /></strong>We're taking a gamble, she's a wild card, but let's hope she delivers what she promises.</p> 
<p>Jack is too much of a wild card to get a place on our team.</p> 
<p>The wild card in this competition is Chelsea: nobody really knows which way the score will go.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Right, have you got that? A wild card can describe someone who is unpredictable or they behave in an unexpected way. But although Brian is a wild card, I wish he'd settle down and do some work instead of joking around all the time.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh do you wish you were a bit like him?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Not at all – anyway what kind of card would you call me?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>You're my favourite card – you're an ace!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Ace! Gosh thanks Feifei, you're such a card!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>See you next time.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>"
"<p><em>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</em></p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Rob and joining me today is Liz.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Hi... everyone - err, Rob, my name is Li, not Liz.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>I'm sorry Li, I'm not really on the ball this morning. &nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Nice phrase though. Why don't you go for a coffee and then you will be on the ball for The English We Speak?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>OK.<em>&nbsp;</em></p> 
<p><em>(A little later)</em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Right, lovely, OK, that's better. I've had a nice cup of coffee and I'm ready to explain the meaning for today's The English We Speak. So, here you go. When you are 'on the ball', it means you are alert and quick to react to things.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>It comes from sports, doesn't it?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Yes. And there's another phrase: 'to keep your eye on the ball' which has a very similar meaning.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>I guess we can use it for any situation which is changing quickly so you need to be focused and sharp.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Indeed. Let's hear some examples:</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p> 
<p>The interviewer raised tough questions but Ma Yun was on the ball.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Financial management is not a job that everyone can do. You have to keep your eye on the ball at all times.<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>And if you want to learn English well you can stay on the ball with <a href=""http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/"">bbclearningenglish.com</a>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Best of luck.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Li<br /></strong>Bye.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Bye bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />…and hello, I'm Rob.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Hey Rob, do you know what's going on in the office today? The boss has been shouting, Helen's crying and Neil doesn't look very happy either.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Beats me. Ouch. What did you do that for?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />You said 'beat me'.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />No, no – I mean it beats me… ouch!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />You are strange Rob.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />No Feifei. I said 'it beats me' to mean I don't know or I don't understand something.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />I knew that Rob – I just liked hitting you with this stick!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Ha! Very funny. Shall we hear some examples?</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />It beats me how Stephanie ever got that promotion.</p> 
<p>A: Can you believe that Dave and Andrea are still married! He's always bossing her around.<br />B: It beats me why she stays with him.</p> 
<p>It beats me how Jen can afford a new sports car when she only works part-time.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />So that is 'it beats me' – a phrase used for saying that you do not know or understand something. So there's no beating involved!</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Definitely not. So now I can safely say, it beats me what's going on in the office – I haven't got a clue.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Well the situation seemed very tense and the boss was shouting something about mice.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Mice... ah yes, well in that case, it could be that I left my lunch on my desk overnight and it's possible the mice have found it and eaten it? They do get everywhere.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Mice! In our office? I hate mice…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Ouch… why are you beating me again? I think it's time to go. Bye.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />And I'm… Rob.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Errr… sorry Rob. What did you say?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />I said, I'm… Rob.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Right, and why have you brought a donkey into the studio?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />To help with today's authentic English phrase – which is… donkey's years.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />So is this about age and how I look like a donkey?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Not exactly Feifei. The phrase comes from rhyming slang – donkey's years rhymes with donkey's ears, yes?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Yes. 'Donkey's years' does rhyme with 'donkey's ears' – so you're saying my ears are like a donkey's?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />No. Unlike your ears, donkey's ears are long and when we say we haven't done something for 'donkey's years' we mean we haven't done something for a long time.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Right. Good, so it's got nothing do with me looking like a donkey?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Absolutely not. Let's hear the phrase in action…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />I'm so bored; I've been doing this job for donkey's years!</p> 
<p>I haven't driven a car for donkey's years; I hope I can remember what to do.</p> 
<p>We've got to go to Lily's party; I haven't seen her for donkey's years so it'll be great to catch up.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />That's 'donkey's years' – when we haven't done something for donkey's years, we haven't done it for a very long time. So Rob, I could say we haven't been to the cinema for donkey's years?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Yes and you'd be correct. We haven't. Shall we go now?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />OK. But does your donkey have to come too?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Oh look, he's very excited!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Yuk! I can see…. What's that on the floor?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Ooooh yes! Perhaps we'll leave him shall we, clear that up later. Perhaps he could present some more programmes while we're away.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Ha – that is donkey work! Bye</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Bye.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>"
"<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Hello welcome to The English We Speak from BBC Learning English. I’m Rob.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Oh hello…I'm Feifei.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Err Feifei, what are you doing?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Cleaning… this place is so dirty… in fact Rob, have you got any soap I could borrow?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Feifei, this isn't like you. You don't normally take cleaning so seriously.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Well, I'm cleaning up because my boss told me to. He said I've got to 'clean up my act'.</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Oh Feifei, you can put down that cloth – he didn't literally mean do the cleaning. He wants you to improve your behaviour or your performance. Have you not been working very hard?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Who me? I always work hard… although I have had a lot of things to do at home… and I did make a few mistakes last week… and when I get stressed I start to shout at people…</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Oh yes, I did hear you. Well I'm sure I can help you clean up your act – if you're sure you know what that means?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Yes. Apparently I need to improve my behaviour! Let's hear some more examples of the phrase in action…</p> 
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />I used to drink a lot of alcohol but when I got ill, I decided to clean up my act and now I only drink cola!</p> 
<p>He turned up late for work every day looking a real mess, so they told him to clean up his act or face losing his job.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Cleaning up my act means I have to work harder… so it's got nothing to do with cleaning or acting Rob?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />No – acting here means behaviour – although your acting on this programme is excellent! So come on then, when are you going to start cleaning up your act?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Right now. I've decided to clean up my act and start work earlier and always get you to check my work so there are no mistakes! So Rob, would you mind checking this script for The English We Speak?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Sure. Let's have a look… perfect! You can tell the boss you've started with a clean slate.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />A clean slate - what does that mean?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />I'll tell you another time. Ooops, I've knocked my coffee over…</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei</strong><br />Oh dear Rob. It looks like you've got to clean up the studio. Do you need this cloth?</p> 
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br />Thanks!</p>

"<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Helen and joining me today is Neil.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></strong>Hello everyone. <br /></p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Neil, tell me about your first ever job. <br /><strong><br />Neil<br /></strong>I worked in a supermarket stacking shelves when I was sixteen. <br /></p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>How was it?<br /></p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>It was quite boring: just moving things from one place to another. But I was very happy when I got my first week's pay.<br /></p> 
<p><strong>Helen<br /></strong>And how long did you stay in your first job?<br /></p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Not very long: about three months during the summer holiday. If I'd stayed there any longer, I would have gone potty.<br /><strong><br />Helen<br /></strong>What? Potty? Did you have to get permission to use the toilet?<br /><br /><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Oh no, nothing like that. Nobody needed permission to go to the toilet. <br /><br /><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Well, you said you would have gone potty. &nbsp;My baby son has to be reminded about his potty every day.<br /><strong><br />Neil<br /></strong>No, they are two very different things. If someone is potty or is going potty, that means they are crazy or going crazy. Here are a few examples:<br /><br /><strong>Examples<br /></strong>My boss wants me to work on New Year’s day for no extra money. He must be potty.<br /><br />She’s potty to sell off her car so cheaply. <br /><br /><strong>Neil <br /></strong>There is another meaning to ‘potty’. If someone is really keen on something we can use the phrase ‘to be potty about something’. For example, I really like Japanese comic books, so I’m potty about them.<br /><br /><strong>Helen<br /></strong>I see. I’m potty about miniature owls: I've got nearly one hundred of them at home.<br /><br /><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well, I am glad we cleared up the meaning of that. It wouldn't do us any good if people heard us arguing over potties. <br /><br /><strong>Helen<br /></strong>Oh no. They’d think we've gone potty.<br /><br /><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye.</p>"
"<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>And I'm Neil.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>And Neil – you look different. I just can't tell what it is…</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Oh, you mean my hair? My pink hair?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Yes, why on earth did you do that?!</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Ah, you know me Feifei. I did it for the lolz!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Right. Well, it is pretty… funny.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Thanks. It's my birthday today and I thought I'd do something fun. If you do something 'for the lolz', it means you do it for fun.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>And as Neil is demonstrating, it's often something a bit silly or crazy. Oh, and happy birthday by the way.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Younger every year. Now, lolz is a close relation of another slang term: LOL.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>LOL stands for 'laughing out loud'. We use it when texting or on social media after a joke or something funny. For example, Neil, your hair looks amazing, LOL.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Why is that a joke? My hair does look great. Anyway. Lolz can be used in the same way.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Your hair looks amazing, lolz.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Thanks. Or we can use it in the phrase 'for the lolz' as I mentioned earlier.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Shall we play some examples?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Or I could play my banjo, for the lolz?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Maybe later! Listen to these examples.</p> 
<p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>A: You're putting so many chillies on your pizza?! Why?<br />B: For the lolz. Going to be hot!</p> 
<p>I collect teapots. Everyone tells me it's pointless but I do it for the lolz.</p> 
<p>I'm going to convince everyone I'm an astronaut, just for the lolz.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>So – lots of lolz examples there. So, how long will your hair stay pink, Neil?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>It's permanent. Unless I dye it again.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Seriously?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Just kidding. Anyway, Feifei, I've got an idea.</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Oh yeah?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Why don't you… walk through the office singing Happy Birthday to me?</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>But… Why?</p> 
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>For the lolz, of course!</p> 
<p><strong>Feifei<br /></strong>Of course.</p> 
<p><strong>Neil</strong><strong> + Feifei<br /></strong>Bye.</p>"
