 <p>Within hours after the people of Greece voted against the terms of a financial <strong>bailout</strong>, the country's combative finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, has <strong>resigned</strong>.</p>

The German economy minister, Sigmar Gabriel, accused the government in Athens of leading the Greek people down a path of <strong>abandonment</strong> and hopelessness.
