"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Lady Bracknell is visiting Jack's house in the country. She won't allow Jack to marry Gwendolen, and Jack, who is Cecily's&nbsp;<strong>guardian</strong>, won't allow Cecily to marry Algernon.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Come here, dear child.&nbsp;How old are you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily<br /></strong>Eighteen.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Well, you'll soon be able to decide yourself who to marry.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Excuse me, Lady Bracknell, but Miss Cardew doesn't&nbsp;<strong>come of age</strong>&nbsp;until she is 35, only then can she marry who she likes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Oh, that's not a problem.&nbsp;Thirty-five is a very attractive age.&nbsp;London society is full of women who have remained 35 for years. Lady Dumbleton, for example, she's been 35 ever since she turned 40, a long time ago.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />But I can't wait that long. I hate waiting even five minutes for someone. Waiting, even to be married, is just not possible.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Well, what shall we do, Cecily?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />I don't know, Algernon.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />My dear Mr Worthing, as Miss Cardew says she cannot wait till she is 35 – which seems to indicate she is a little impatient – could you change your mind?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />My dear Lady Bracknell, the moment you agree to my marriage with Gwendolen, I will happily allow your nephew to become engaged to Cecily.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />That is impossible. Look at the time! Gwendolen, dear, we've already missed five trains.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>But they'll miss the next one, too, because Reverend Chasuble arrives to announce that everything is ready for the&nbsp;<strong>christenings</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Christenings, sir!&nbsp;Isn't that a little&nbsp;<strong>premature</strong>?</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />Both these gentlemen have said they want to be christened this afternoon.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />At their age?&nbsp;That's ridiculous!&nbsp;Algernon, Lord Bracknell would be very unhappy if he knew this was how you wasted your time and money.</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />So, no christenings this afternoon?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />It would be no use to either of us, Reverend Chasuble, at the moment.</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />Well, I'll return to the church straight away. It seems Miss Prism has been waiting there for me for an hour and a half.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Miss Prism!&nbsp;Did you say Miss Prism?</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />Yes, Lady Bracknell.&nbsp;I'm going to see her now.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Wait a moment. Is this Miss Prism an unattractive woman, connected with education?</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />She's very well educated indeed.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />It's obviously the same person.&nbsp;And what position does she have in your house?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Miss Prism, Lady Bracknell, is Miss Cardew's&nbsp;<strong>governess</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />I must see her at once.</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />Well, she's here now! Look, she's coming up the garden path.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Miss Prism arrives. When she sees Lady Bracknell, she goes white.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Prism! Come here!&nbsp;Where is that baby? Twenty-eight years ago, Prism,&nbsp;<strong>you left my house with a pram in which a male baby was sleeping</strong>. You never came back.&nbsp;<strong>The police found the pram</strong>.It contained a novel but no baby! Prism!&nbsp;What happened to that baby?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />Lady Bracknell, I really don't know.&nbsp;I wish I did.&nbsp;This is what happened. I took the baby out in its pram as usual.&nbsp;<strong>I also took with me a large, old handbag in which I was intending to put the novel that I had written</strong>.&nbsp;In a moment&nbsp;<strong>when I wasn't thinking,</strong>&nbsp;<strong>I put the novel in the pram, and placed the baby in the bag</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />But where did you put the bag?</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />I left it in the&nbsp;<strong>cloakroom</strong>&nbsp;of a railway station in London.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Which railway station?</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />Victoria.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />I must just go to my room.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>He rushes off. After several minutes, Jack&nbsp;returns carrying a black leather bag.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Is this the bag, Miss Prism?</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />Yes, here are my&nbsp;<strong>initials</strong>.&nbsp;I'm so pleased to get it back so&nbsp;<strong>unexpectedly</strong>.&nbsp;It has been very&nbsp;<strong>inconvenient</strong>&nbsp;not to have it all these years.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Miss Prism, it's not just the bag that has been given back to you. I was the baby in it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />You?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Yes… mother!</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />Mr Worthing, there is some mistake!&nbsp;Lady Bracknell&nbsp;can tell you who you really are.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Lady Bracknell, I hate to be&nbsp;<strong>inquisitive</strong>, but could you tell me who I am?</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />I'm afraid you are the son of my poor sister, Mrs Moncrieff. You are Algernon's elder brother.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Algy's elder brother! Then I do have a brother. I always said I had a brother! Algy, you'll have to treat me with more respect in future. You have never behaved like a brother to me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I did my best.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />My darling!&nbsp;But what is your christian name, now that you have become someone else?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Good heavens! I had forgotten about that.&nbsp;Lady Bracknell,&nbsp;<strong>when Miss Prism left me in the bag, had I been christened already</strong>?</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Your parents gave you everything, including a christening.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Well, what name was I given?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />You were the eldest son, so you were given your father's name.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Yes, but what was his name?</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />I cannot remember the General's full name.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Algy!&nbsp;Can't you remember what our father's name was?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />My dear fellow, I was one when he died.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />His name would appear in the army lists, wouldn't it, Lady Bracknell?</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />That's true.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />I have the lists of the last 40 years here.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />He rushes to the bookcase and pulls the books out.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>Generals… Mallam, Migsby, Moncrieff! General 1869, his full name was… Jack Ernest! … I always told you, Gwendolen, my name was Ernest, didn't I? Well, it is Ernest after all.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Ernest! My own Ernest!&nbsp;I felt from the beginning that you could have no other name!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Gwendolen, it is a terrible thing for a man to suddenly find out that all his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth.&nbsp;Can you forgive me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />I can.&nbsp;For I'm sure you will change.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />My darling!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And Jack&nbsp;<strong>embraces</strong>&nbsp;Gwendolen. Algernon does the same with Cecily. Even Reverend Chasuble embraces someone – Miss Prism, much to her delight.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Gwendolen!&nbsp;At last!</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />My nephew, you are showing a lack of seriousness.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />No, it's the opposite, Lady Bracknell. I've now realised for the first time in my life the extreme Importance of Being&nbsp;<strong>Earnest</strong>.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Gwendolen and Cecily are angry with Jack and Algernon now they know their real names – neither of them are called Ernest. The two women are inside the house. The men come in trying to look and sound cheerful.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack and Algernon<br /></strong>[whistling Daisy, Daisy]</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />I'm sure they're feeling sorry. Let's not say anything.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Certainly not. Mr Moncrieff, why did you pretend to be my&nbsp;<strong>guardian</strong>'s brother?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />So that I had the opportunity to meet you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />That seems a satisfactory explanation, doesn't it Gwendolen?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Yes, if you can believe him.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />I don't.&nbsp;But his answer was so beautiful.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />True.&nbsp;In matters of great importance, it's style, not truth that is essential.&nbsp;Mr Worthing, why did you pretend to have a brother?&nbsp;Was it so you could come to London to see me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Do you have any doubts, dear Gwendolen?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />I have serious doubts.&nbsp;But I intend to ignore them.&nbsp;Cecily, should we forgive them?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Yes.&nbsp;I mean no.&nbsp;<strong>Probably</strong>&nbsp;not. What about their names?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />True!&nbsp;I had forgotten!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong>&nbsp;<strong>and</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Cecily</strong><br />Your names are still a huge problem!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong>&nbsp;<strong>and&nbsp;Algernon</strong><br />Our names!&nbsp;Is that all?&nbsp;But we are going to be&nbsp;<strong>christened&nbsp;</strong>with a different name this afternoon.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />You are prepared to do this terrible thing for me, Jack?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />I am.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />To please me you are ready to face this awful experience, Algernon?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I am!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />How can people talk about the equality of the sexes!&nbsp;Men have moments of physical&nbsp;<strong>courage</strong>&nbsp;which we women know&nbsp;<strong>absolutely</strong>&nbsp;nothing about.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Jack, darling!</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Cecily, darling!&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And they fall into each other's arms. Merriman comes in and coughs&nbsp;<strong>loudly</strong>. He announces a visitor.</p> 
 <p><strong>Merriman</strong><br />Ahem!&nbsp;Ahem!&nbsp;Lady Bracknell!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Good heavens!</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Gwendolen!&nbsp;What does this mean?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br /><strong>Simply</strong>&nbsp;that I am engaged to Mr Worthing, mamma.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Mr Worthing, I followed my daughter by train. Gwendolen is meant to be attending a university lecture. Well, that is what her father thinks. All communication between yourself and my daughter must end&nbsp;<strong>immediately</strong>.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />We are engaged to be married, Lady Bracknell!</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />You are nothing of the kind, sir.&nbsp;And now, what about Algernon! … Algernon!</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Yes, Aunt Augusta.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />May I ask if it is in this house that your sick friend Mr Bunbury lives?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Oh!&nbsp;No!&nbsp;Bunbury doesn't live here.&nbsp;Bunbury is somewhere else at the moment.&nbsp;In fact, Bunbury is dead.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Dead!&nbsp;When did he die?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Oh!&nbsp;I killed Bunbury this afternoon. I mean poor Bunbury died this afternoon.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />He died so&nbsp;<strong>suddenly</strong>? What did he die of?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I mean he was discovered!&nbsp;The doctors discovered that he could not live, so he died.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />He seems to have had great&nbsp;<strong>confidence</strong>&nbsp;in the opinion of his doctors.&nbsp;I am glad that he&nbsp;<strong>finally</strong>&nbsp;made up his mind to take some definite course of action, and acted under proper medical advice.&nbsp;And now, Mr Worthing, who is the young person whose hand my nephew Algernon is holding in an unnecessary way?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />That is Miss Cecily Cardew, I'm her guardian.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I am engaged to Cecily, Aunt Augusta.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />I beg your pardon?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Mr Moncrieff and I are engaged to be married, Lady Bracknell.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Lady Bracknell has to sit down at this news.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />There seems to be something&nbsp;<strong>unusually</strong>&nbsp;exciting in the air – the number of engagements seems to be above average. Mr Worthing, is Miss Cardew at all connected with any railway stations in London?&nbsp;I am&nbsp;<strong>simply</strong>&nbsp;asking.&nbsp;Until yesterday I didn't know any families or people whose origin was a station.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Miss Cecily Cardew is the granddaughter of the&nbsp;<strong>late</strong>&nbsp;Mr Thomas Cardew of 149 Belgrave Square; Gervase Park,&nbsp;<strong>Surrey</strong>; and the Sporran,&nbsp;<strong>Fifeshire</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Three addresses. That&nbsp;<strong>always</strong>&nbsp;gives me<strong>&nbsp;confidence</strong>. I am not unsatisfied.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />How&nbsp;<strong>extremely</strong>&nbsp;kind of you, Lady Bracknell!&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Now Gwendolen, we have to leave… Just one thing, Mr Worthing, does Miss Cardew have any money?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Oh! About &pound;130,000. That is all.&nbsp;Goodbye, Lady Bracknell.&nbsp;So pleased to have seen you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />A moment, Mr Worthing.&nbsp;&pound;130,000!&nbsp;Miss Cardew seems to me a most attractive young lady, now that I look at her. Come over here, dear… Turn round, dear child, so I can see your face.There are definite social possibilities in your face.&nbsp;Algernon!</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Yes, Aunt Augusta!</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />There are definite social possibilities in Miss Cardew.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I don't care about social possibilities.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Never speak&nbsp;<strong>disrespectfully</strong>&nbsp;of Society, Algernon.&nbsp;Only people who can't get into it do that.&nbsp;Now Miss Cardew, of course you know that Algernon has nothing but his&nbsp;<strong>debts&nbsp;</strong>to depend upon.&nbsp;But I do not approve of marriages for money. Well, I suppose I must give my&nbsp;<strong>consent</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Thank you, Aunt Augusta.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />The marriage had better take place quite soon. I am not in favour of long engagements. They give people the chance to find out each other's characters before marriage – never a good thing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />I'm sorry to interrupt you, Lady Bracknell, but I am Miss Cardew's guardian, and I don't give my consent to this marriage.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />And why not may I ask?&nbsp;Isn't Algernon an extremely&nbsp;<strong>eligible</strong>&nbsp;young man? He has nothing, but he looks everything.&nbsp;What more can one desire?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />The fact is that I do not&nbsp;<strong>approve</strong>&nbsp;of his&nbsp;<strong>moral</strong>&nbsp;character.&nbsp;He has not been honest.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Algernon&nbsp;and&nbsp;Cecily&nbsp;look at him amazed.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Untruthful! Algernon? Impossible!&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />I'm afraid there is no doubt.&nbsp;This afternoon he came to my house pretending to be my brother.&nbsp;He has succeeded in one afternoon to change the affections of dear Cecily.&nbsp;He then stayed to tea, and ate all the&nbsp;<strong>muffins</strong>.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Ahem! Mr Worthing, after careful consideration I have decided to forgive my nephew's behaviour.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />That is very generous of you, Lady Bracknell. However&nbsp;I have not changed my mind. I do not give my consent.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Cecily and Gwendolen both thought they were engaged to someone called Ernest. But Gwendolen has just found out her man's real name is Jack. Let's join them in the garden now, where Cecily is asking Algernon an important question...</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily<br /></strong>Are you engaged to Gwendolen?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Engaged to Gwendolen? Of course not!&nbsp;What made you think that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Thank you.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And Cecily lets Algernon kiss her on her cheek.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />I knew there was some slight error, Miss Cardew.&nbsp;<strong>The gentleman who is now</strong>&nbsp;<strong>embracing</strong>&nbsp;you is my cousin, Mr Algernon Moncrieff.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Algernon! Is your name Algernon?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I cannot&nbsp;<strong>deny</strong>&nbsp;it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Oh!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Is your name really Jack?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />My name certainly is Jack.&nbsp;It's been Jack for years.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Gwendolen, we have both been greatly&nbsp;<strong>deceived</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />My poor Cecily!</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />My sweet Gwendolen!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack&nbsp;</strong><strong>and&nbsp;Algernon</strong>&nbsp;<br />[groan]</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Mr Worthing, there is just one question I would like to ask you.&nbsp;Where is your brother Ernest?&nbsp;Cecily and I are both engaged to be married to your brother, so it is a&nbsp;<strong>matter</strong>&nbsp;of some importance to us to know where he is at present.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Gwendolen, Cecily, it is very painfulfor me to speak the truth and I am really quite inexperienced in doing anything of the kind.&nbsp;However, I will tell you quite frankly that I don't have a brother Ernest.&nbsp;I don't have a brother at all.&nbsp;I've never had a brother in my life, and I don't plan to ever have one in the future.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />No brother at all?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />None!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Have you never had a brother of any kind?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Never.&nbsp;Not even of any kind.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Cecily, it's quite clear that neither of us are engaged to be married to anyone.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />It's not a very pleasant position for a young girl suddenly to find herself in.&nbsp;Is it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Let's go in the house.&nbsp;They'll dare not come after us there.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />No, men are so&nbsp;<strong>cowardly</strong>, aren't they?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And the two women, who minutes before were arguing, now go arm in arm into the house.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />This awful situation is what you call&nbsp;<strong>Bunburying</strong>, I suppose?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Yes, and a wonderful Bunbury it is.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Well, you've no right to Bunbury here.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />That's absurd.&nbsp;People can Bunbury anywhere they choose.&nbsp;Every serious Bunburyist knows that.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Serious Bunburyist!&nbsp;Good heavens!</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Well, you have to be serious about something.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Well, the only satisfaction I have in all this terrible business is that your friend Bunbury is finished.&nbsp;You won't be able to run to the country quite as often as you used to, dear Algy.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Your brother is a little unwell, isn't he, dear Jack? You won't be able to disappear to London quite so frequently now.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />As for your behaviour towards Miss Cardew, I must say that fooling a sweet, innocent girl like that is quite&nbsp;<strong>inexcusable</strong>.&nbsp;To say nothing of the fact that I am her guardian.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I can see no excuse at all for you deceiving a clever, thoroughly experienced young lady like Miss Fairfax. To say nothing of the fact that she is my cousin.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />I wanted to be engaged to Gwendolen, that is all.&nbsp;I love her.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Well, I simply wanted to be engaged to Cecily. I adore her.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />There is certainly no chance of your marrying Miss Cardew.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />And I don't think it's very likely, Jack, that you and Miss Fairfax will be together. Ooh... muffins...</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Well, that's no business of yours... And how can you sit there, calmly eating muffins when we are in this horrible trouble? You seem perfectly&nbsp;<strong>heartless</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong>&nbsp;<br />[eating] Well, I can't eat muffins in a nervous way.&nbsp;The butter would probably get on my sleeves.&nbsp;You should always eat muffins quite calmly.&nbsp;It's the only way to eat them.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong>&nbsp;<br />Well, that's no reason to eat them all in that greedy way. Give them to me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon<br /></strong>But you just said it was heartless to eat muffins.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>Algy, I wish you would go.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />You can't possibly ask me to go without having some dinner.&nbsp;Besides I have just arranged with&nbsp;<strong>Reverend</strong>&nbsp;Chasuble to be christened at a quarter to six with the name of Ernest.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />My dear fellow, please stop that nonsense.&nbsp;I arranged this morning with Reverend Chasuble to be&nbsp;<strong>christened</strong>&nbsp;myself at 5.30, and I will, of course, take the name of Ernest. We can't both be called Ernest. Besides, I have a perfect&nbsp;<strong>right</strong>&nbsp;to be christened if I like.&nbsp;There is no evidence at all that I have ever been christened by anybody. You, on the other hand, have already been christened.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Yes, but I haven't been christened for years.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Yes, but you have been christened.&nbsp;That's the important thing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Yes, so I know I can stand it. You're not quite sure that you have ever been christened, and I think it would be rather dangerous to do it now.&nbsp;It might make you very unwell.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />[eating] Oh, that's nonsense; you are always talking nonsense.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Jack, you're eating the muffins again!&nbsp;I wish you wouldn't.&nbsp;There are only two left.&nbsp;I told you I was particularly fond of muffins.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Algernon!&nbsp;I have already told you to go.&nbsp;I don't want you here.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I haven't quite finished my tea yet! And there is still one muffin left.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />[groans in despair]&nbsp;</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Algernon and Cecily are engaged. But Cecily thinks his name is Ernest and so Algernon has rushed off to change his name. Meanwhile, Gwendolen has arrived and&nbsp;<strong>is about to&nbsp;</strong>meet Cecily for the first time. Gwendolen also thinks she's engaged to someone called Ernest.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Hello, my name is Cecily Cardew.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />What a sweet name! I like you already.&nbsp;I think&nbsp;<strong>we are going to be</strong>&nbsp;great friends.&nbsp;My&nbsp;<strong>first</strong>&nbsp;<strong>impressions</strong>&nbsp;of people are never wrong.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />How nice of you to like me so much when we have only just met.&nbsp;Please sit down.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />May I call you Cecily?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />With pleasure!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />And you can call me Gwendolen… You are here on a short visit, I suppose.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Oh no!&nbsp;I live here.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Really?&nbsp;Your mother, no doubt, lives here, too?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Oh no!&nbsp;I don't have a mother or father - in fact, I don't have any relations.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Really?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />My dear&nbsp;<strong>guardian</strong>&nbsp;looks after me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Your guardian?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Yes, Mr Worthing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>She means Jack, of course.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Oh!&nbsp;That's strange - he's never mentioned to me that he was a guardian. And I'm not sure, that this news fills me with great delight... I have liked you ever since I met you, Cecily.&nbsp;But now that I know that Mr Worthing is your guardian, I can't help wishing that you were... well… just a little older, and not quite so... well... attractive.&nbsp;In fact, if I may speak honestly...</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Please do...</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Well, to be honest, Cecily, I wish that you were 42 and unattractive.&nbsp;Ernest would never lie to me. Though I don't always trust him, [to herself] especially with beautiful women.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />I'm sorry, Gwendolen, did you say Ernest?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Yes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Oh, but it isn't Mr Ernest Worthing who is my guardian.&nbsp;It's his brother - his elder brother.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>By Ernest Worthing, she means Algernon.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Ernest never mentioned to me that he had a brother.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Well, they haven't been getting along well for a long time.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Ah! that explains it.&nbsp;Cecily, you have greatly&nbsp;<strong>reassured&nbsp;</strong>me.&nbsp;I was beginning to get anxious.&nbsp;You are quite sure that it is not Mr Ernest Worthing who is your guardian?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Quite sure.&nbsp;In fact, I am going to be his.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />&nbsp;I beg your pardon?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />&nbsp;Dearest Gwendolen&nbsp;<strong>Mr Ernest Worthing and I are going to get married</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Now when Cecily says Ernest here, she, of course, means Algernon, who she thinks is called Ernest.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />My darling Cecily, there must be some mistake.&nbsp;Mr Ernest Worthing is engaged to me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And when Gwendolen says Ernest here, she, of course, means Jack.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen<br />The announcement will appear</strong>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;paperon Saturday.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />&nbsp;You must be mistaken.&nbsp;Ernest proposed to me ten minutes ago.&nbsp;I've written it in my diary.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />That's very strange, because he asked me marry him yesterday afternoon.&nbsp;Here, it's in my diary. I never travel without my diary.&nbsp;You should always have something excitingto read in the train. I'm sorry, dear Cecily, but I'm afraid he was mine first.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />It upsets me, dear Gwendolen, but I have to point out that since Ernest proposed to you, he has clearly changed his mind.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />If the poor fellow has been&nbsp;<strong>trapped</strong>&nbsp;<strong>I intend to rescue</strong>&nbsp;him at once.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong>&nbsp;<br />Whatever&nbsp;<strong>entanglement&nbsp;</strong>my dear boy has got into,&nbsp;<strong>I will never</strong>&nbsp;<strong>blame&nbsp;</strong>him.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Are you referring to me, Miss Cardew, as an entanglement?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Do you suggest, Miss Fairfax, that I trapped Ernest into an engagement?&nbsp;How dare you?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen<br /></strong>Miss Cardew…</p> 
 <p><strong>Merriman&nbsp;</strong><br />&nbsp;Ahem!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />But they are interrupted by Merriman who arrives with the tea. The two women look angrily at each other. They can't continue their argument in front of him.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />&nbsp;Are there many interesting walks around here, Miss Cardew?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Oh! Yes! Several. From the top of the hills you can see five&nbsp;<strong>counties</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Five counties!&nbsp;I wouldn't like that; I hate crowds.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />&nbsp;I suppose that is why you live in London?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />&nbsp;Quite a well-kept garden this is, Miss Cardew.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />So glad you like it, Miss Fairfax.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />I had no idea there were any flowers in the country.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Oh, flowers are as common here, Miss Fairfax, as people are in London. Would you like some tea, Miss Fairfax?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />&nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;Awful girl!&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />&nbsp;Sugar?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />[Superciliously]&nbsp;No, thank you.&nbsp;Sugar is not fashionable any more.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Cecily&nbsp;puts four lumps of sugar into the cup, which she gives to Gwendolen, who does not notice as she is&nbsp;<strong>short-sighted</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />[Severely]&nbsp;Cake or bread and butter?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Bread and butter, please.&nbsp;Cake is rarely seen at the best houses nowadays.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Cecily cuts a large slice of cake and hands it to Gwendolen. Gwendolen&nbsp;drinks the tea and&nbsp;<strong>shudders</strong>.&nbsp;She puts down the cup, reaches out for the bread and butter and finds it's cake.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />You have put sugar in my tea, and though I asked quite clearly for bread and butter, you have given me cake.&nbsp;I usually have a gentle and sweet nature, but I warn you, Miss Cardew, you may go too far.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />I would do anything to save my poor, innocent boy from the secret plansof another girl.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />From the moment I saw you I distrusted you.&nbsp;My first impressions of people are always right.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />It seems to me, Miss Fairfax, that I am wasting your valuable time.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And here comes Jack.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Ernest!&nbsp;My own Ernest!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Gwendolen!&nbsp;Darling!&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />[Draws back]&nbsp;Wait!&nbsp;May I ask if you are engaged to this young lady?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />&nbsp;To dear little Cecily!&nbsp;Of course not!&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Thank you.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />&nbsp; I knew there must be some misunderstanding, Miss Fairfax.&nbsp;This gentleman is my guardian, Mr Jack Worthing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />I beg your pardon?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />This is Uncle Jack.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Jack!&nbsp;Oh!&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And now Algernon arrives, too.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Here is Ernest.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Cecily, my love!&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Wait, Ernest!&nbsp;May I ask you - are you engaged to this young lady?</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Jack is not happy that Algernon has come to his house pretending to be his younger brother Ernest. And he's really not happy that Algernon has met Cecily, telling him to go back to London immediately. Jack has also asked Reverend Chasuble to christen him with a different name. Let's now join Algernon and Cecily in the garden.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon<br /></strong>I hope you won't mind, Cecily, if I tell you quite truthfully that you seem to me to be in every way absolutely perfect.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecil</strong><strong>y&nbsp;<br /></strong>I admire your honesty, Ernest.&nbsp;Now, can I just write down what you are saying in my diary.&nbsp;[Writing in diary] ev... er... y... way... abs...</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon<br /></strong>Do you really keep a diary?&nbsp;<strong>I'd love to</strong>&nbsp;have a look. May I?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oh no. You see, it's just a young girl's&nbsp;<strong>record</strong>&nbsp;of her own thoughts, so I can publish them. But, Ernest, please, don't stop talking.&nbsp;I love doing&nbsp;<strong>dictation</strong>.&nbsp;I have reached&nbsp;<em>'</em>absolutely perfect'.&nbsp;Go on...</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Ahem!&nbsp;Ahem!</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Oh, don't cough, Ernest. I don't know how to spell a cough.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br /><strong>The truth is,</strong>&nbsp;Cecily, ever since I first saw you, I have loved you wildly,&nbsp;<strong>passionately</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>hopelessly</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />[Writing] Wildly... passionately... Oh, I don't think that you should tell me that you love me wildly, passionately and hopelessly.&nbsp;Hopelessly doesn't make much sense, does it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Here comes the butler, Merriman, again...</p> 
 <p><strong>Merriman</strong><br />The carriage is waiting, sir.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Tell it to come back next week.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Uncle Jack would be very annoyed if he knew you were staying till next week.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Oh, I don't care about Jack. I only care about you.&nbsp;I love you, Cecily. You will marry me, won't you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br /><strong>What a question!</strong>&nbsp;Of course, silly!&nbsp;Well, we have been engaged for the last three months.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />For the last three months?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Yes, it will be exactly three months on Thursday.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />But how did we become engaged?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Well, ever since Uncle Jack told us that he had a&nbsp;<strong>wicked&nbsp;</strong>younger brother, you have been the main topic of conversation between myself and Miss Prism.&nbsp;And a man who is talked about a lot is always very attractive. I fell in love with you, Ernest.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br /><strong>Darling!&nbsp;</strong>And when did we actually get engaged?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />On the 14th of February.&nbsp;I got tired of the fact you didn't know I existed, and so, after a long&nbsp;<strong>struggle</strong>&nbsp;with myself, I decided to accept you under this dear old oak tree here.&nbsp;Here are all your letters in this box.&nbsp;Look...</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And my goodness... There's a whole&nbsp;<strong>bundle</strong>&nbsp;of letters neatly tied up with a blue&nbsp;<strong>ribbon</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />My letters!&nbsp;But, my own sweet Cecily, I have never written you any letters.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />You don't need to remind me, Ernest. I had to write your letters for you.&nbsp;I wrote three times a week, and sometimes more often.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Oh, do let me read them, Cecily.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Oh, no.&nbsp;They would make you far too&nbsp;<strong>conceited</strong>.&nbsp;The three you wrote after I had&nbsp;<strong>broken off&nbsp;</strong>the engagement are so beautiful, and so badly spelt, that even now I can hardly read them without crying a little.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />But did we break off our engagement?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Of course we did.&nbsp;On the 22nd of March.&nbsp;Look I'll read about it to you. [Reading from diary] 'Today I broke off my engagement with Ernest.&nbsp;I think it is the best thing to do.&nbsp;The weather is still lovely.'</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />But why on earth did you break it off?&nbsp;What had I done?&nbsp;I had done nothing at all.&nbsp;Cecily, I am very hurt to hear you broke it off.&nbsp;Particularly when the weather was so lovely.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />It wouldn't have been a really serious engagement if it hadn't been broken off at least once.&nbsp;But I forgave you very quickly.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong>&nbsp;<br /><strong>What an angel&nbsp;</strong>you are, Cecily!</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily<br /></strong>You dear romantic boy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />You'll never end our engagement again, will you Cecily?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Not now that I have actually met you.&nbsp;Besides, of course, there is&nbsp;<strong>the question of your name</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Yes, of course.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />You mustn't laugh at me, but it had always been a girlish dream of mine to love someone whose name was Ernest. That name&nbsp;<strong>inspires</strong>&nbsp;complete confidence.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />But, Cecily, do you mean that you could not love me if I had a different name?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />But what name?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Oh, any name you like - Algernon - for instance...</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />But I don't like the name Algernon. I might respect you, Ernest, but I don't think I'd be able to really love you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Ahem!&nbsp;Cecily! The Reverend is, I suppose, knows how to carry out all church ceremonies?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Oh, yes. Reverend Chasuble is a very clever man.&nbsp;He has never written a single book, so you can imagine how much he knows.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I must see him at once on a most important christening - I mean on important business.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Oh!</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I won't be away more than half an hour.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Considering that we have been engaged since February the 14th, and that I only met you today for the first time, I think it's rather hard that you should leave me for so long. Couldn't you make it 20 minutes?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />[He kisses her] I'll be back in no time.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Merriman arrives to announce the arrival of a visitor.</p> 
 <p><strong>Merriman</strong><br />A Miss Fairfax is here to see Mr Worthing.&nbsp;On very important business, Miss Fairfax says.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Isn't Mr Worthing in the library?</p> 
 <p><strong>Merriman</strong><br />Mr Worthing went to see Reverend Chasuble some time ago.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Please ask the lady to come out here. Mr Worthing will be back soon, I'm sure.&nbsp;And you can bring tea.</p> 
 <p><strong>Merriman</strong><br />Yes, Miss.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Miss Fairfax!&nbsp;I suppose one of the many elderly women who are associated with Uncle Jack in some of his goodwork in London.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>But it's not an elderly woman who follows Merriman into the garden.&nbsp;<strong>What a surprise!&nbsp;</strong>It's Gwendolen!</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Jack has returned earlier than expected to his house in the country. He's just told Miss Prism and Reverend Chasuble that his younger brother Ernest is dead. What they don't know is that Algernon is at the house at this very moment, pretending to be Ernest.</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />I am very sorry about your brother, Mr Worthing. I shall, of course, mention this tragic event in my&nbsp;<strong>sermon&nbsp;</strong>next Sunday.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />That would be most kind, Reverend.</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong>&nbsp;<br /><strong>I can usually adapt</strong>&nbsp;my weekly sermon to almost any occasion, happy or sad – weddings,&nbsp;<strong>christenings</strong>...</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Christenings... Ah! That reminds me, Reverend Chasuble.&nbsp;I suppose you do know how to&nbsp;<strong>christen</strong>?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />Well...</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I mean, of course,&nbsp;<strong>you often christen people</strong>, don't you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />But which baby do you want to christen, Mr Worthing?&nbsp;Your brother wasn't married, was he?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Oh no. But it's not for a child, Reverend. No! It's me - I'd like to be christened... this afternoon.</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />But surely&nbsp;<strong>you have been christened</strong>&nbsp;<strong>already</strong>?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />I don't remember anything about it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Well, what time would you like the ceremony performed?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Oh, around five if that would suit you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />Perfectly!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Just at this time, Cecily comes out of the house into the garden.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Uncle Jack!&nbsp;Oh, I am pleased to see you back.&nbsp;But why are you wearing those awful clothes?</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />Cecily!</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Oh! What's the matter, Uncle Jack? You look so sad, and I've got such a surprise for you.&nbsp;Who do you think is in the dining room?&nbsp;Your brother!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Who?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Your brother Ernest.&nbsp;He arrived about half an hour ago.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />But I haven't got a brother.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Oh, don't say that.&nbsp;However badly he may have behaved to you in the past, he is&nbsp;<strong>still&nbsp;</strong>your brother.&nbsp;I'll tell him to come out. You will shake hands with him, won't you, Uncle Jack?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>[Cecily leaves]</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />This is happy news...</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />My brother here?&nbsp;<strong>That's quite</strong>&nbsp;<strong>absurd</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Cecily comes out of the house again, this time holding Algernon's hand. &nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Good heavens!&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Brother Jack, I've come to tell you that I'm very sorry for all the trouble I've given you, and that I plan to lead a better life in the future.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Jack&nbsp;can't believe his eyes and stares at his friend. Algernon puts out his hand, but Jack ignores it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Uncle Jack, you are not going to refuse to shake your own brother's hand?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Nothing will make me shake his hand.&nbsp;I think him coming down here is&nbsp;<strong>disgraceful</strong>.&nbsp;He knows perfectly well why.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Uncle Jack, do be nice.&nbsp;There is some good in everyone.&nbsp;<strong>Ernest has just been telling me</strong>&nbsp;about his poor sick friend Mr Bunbury whom&nbsp;<strong>he often visits</strong>. And&nbsp;<strong>there must certainly be</strong>&nbsp;a lot of good in someone who is kind to a sick friend.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Oh! He's been talking about Bunbury, has he?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Yes, he has told me all about poor Mr Bunbury, and how ill he is.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Bunbury!&nbsp;Well, I won't let him talk to you about Bunbury or about anything else.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Of course I admit that I have not behaved well, but I expected a more enthusiastic welcome, especially as it's the first time I have come here.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Uncle Jack, if you don't shake hands with Ernest I'll never forgive you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Never forgive me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Never!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Well, this is the last time I shall ever do it... There!</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />I think we should leave the two brothers together.</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />Cecily, you will come with us.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />And so they all go off leaving the men alone. Jack tells Algernon he must leave immediately, but just then, the butler, Merriman, arrives.</p> 
 <p><strong>Merriman</strong><br />I have put Mr Ernest's things in the room next to yours, sir.&nbsp;I suppose that is all right?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />What?</p> 
 <p><strong>Merriman</strong><br />Mr Ernest's luggage, sir.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />His luggage?</p> 
 <p><strong>Merriman</strong><br />Yes, sir.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Merriman, order the carriage at once.&nbsp;Mr Ernest has been suddenly called back to London.</p> 
 <p><strong>Merriman</strong><br />Yes, sir.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />What a terrible&nbsp;<strong>liar</strong>&nbsp;you are, Jack.&nbsp;I have not been called back to London at all.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Yes, you have.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon<br /></strong>Well, I have to say, Cecily is lovely.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />You are not allowed to talk of Miss Cardew like that.&nbsp;I don't like it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Well, I don't like your clothes.&nbsp;Why don't you go and change?&nbsp;It is perfectly&nbsp;<strong>childish</strong>&nbsp;to be in&nbsp;<strong>mourning&nbsp;</strong>for a man who is&nbsp;<strong>actually</strong>&nbsp;staying in your house as a guest.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />You are certainly not staying with me as a guest or anything else.&nbsp;You are leaving... by the four-five train.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Well, I won't leave you while you are in mourning.&nbsp;It would be most unkind.&nbsp;If I was in mourning, I think it would be very unkind if you didn't stay with me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Well, will you leave if I change my clothes?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Yes, if you are not too long.&nbsp;<strong>I've never known</strong>&nbsp;anyone take so long to get dressed and with such little result.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Well,&nbsp;<strong>it's better than</strong>&nbsp;<strong>always being</strong>&nbsp;over-dressed as you are.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />If&nbsp;<strong>I am occasionally a little over-dressed</strong>, I make up for it&nbsp;<strong>by always being</strong>&nbsp;immensely over-educated.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Your&nbsp;<strong>vanity</strong>&nbsp;is ridiculous and your behaviour is an&nbsp;<strong>outrage</strong>. You have got to catch the four-five back to London.&nbsp;This Bunburying, as you call it, has not been a great success for you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Jack leaves.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />[To himself] I think it has been a great success.&nbsp;I'm in love with Cecily. I must see her before I go.&nbsp;Ah, there she is watering the flowers.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Oh, I just came back to water the roses.&nbsp;I thought you were with Uncle Jack.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />He's gone to order the carriage for me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Oh, is he going to take you for a nice drive?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />He's going to send me away.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Then have we got to say goodbye?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I'm afraid so.&nbsp;It's a very painful&nbsp;<strong>parting</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />It's always painful to part from people you have only just met. It's easy to be apart from old friends for a long time. But being apart for just a short period from someone you have just been introduced to is almost unbearable.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Thank you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Merriman</strong><br />The carriage is at the door, sir. &nbsp;</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Algernon secretly managed to find out the address of Jack's house in the country – the house where he lives with Cecily. We now join Cecily, a pretty girl of eighteen, and her&nbsp;<strong>governess</strong>&nbsp;Miss Prism – that's the lady who looks after her, in their garden on a summer's day. They're studying German grammar, but Cecily seems more interested in the flowers.</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />Cecily!&nbsp;Leave the flowers. Sit down and we'll look at the German verbs.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />But I really don't like German.</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />Cecily, you know Mr Worthing wants you to improve yourself.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Dear Uncle Jack is so serious!</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />Cecily!&nbsp;I am surprised at you.&nbsp;You know the problems Mr Worthing has. You must remember how worried he is about his&nbsp;<strong>unfortunate</strong>&nbsp;young brother.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />I wish Uncle Jack would let that unfortunate young man, his brother, come here sometimes. Oh, Miss Prism… Look who's coming… It's&nbsp;<strong>Reverend&nbsp;</strong>Chasuble.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And indeed, they hadn't noticed the middle-aged man walking up the garden because&nbsp;<strong>they</strong>&nbsp;<strong>had been</strong>&nbsp;<strong>talking&nbsp;</strong>so energetically about Jack.</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />Reverend Chasuble!&nbsp;This is a pleasure.</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />Oh, Miss Prism, I hope you are well?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Miss Prism has just been complaining of a headache.&nbsp;I think it would be good for her to have a short walk with you in the park, Reverend.</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />I haven't mentioned anything about a headache.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />No, dear Miss Prism, I know that, but I thought you&nbsp;<strong>had been looking</strong>&nbsp;like you might get one.</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />Mr Worthing, I suppose, has not returned from London yet?</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />He won't be back until Monday afternoon.</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />Ah yes, he likes spending Sunday in London.&nbsp;He's not one of those people who spend all their time enjoying themselves, not like that young man his brother.</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />I think, dear Reverend, I will have a walk with you.&nbsp;I find I have a headache after all, and a walk might do it good.</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />With pleasure, Miss Prism.</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />Cecily, you can read your economics book while I'm gone.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />So Miss Prism and Dr Chasuble wander off, leaving Cecily alone. She immediately shuts her book on economics and is about to get up when Merriman, the&nbsp;<strong>butler</strong>, arrives.</p> 
 <p><strong>Merriman</strong><br />Mr Ernest Worthing has just driven over from the station.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Uncle Jack's brother!&nbsp;Did you tell him Mr Worthing was in London?</p> 
 <p><strong>Merriman</strong><br />Yes, Miss.&nbsp;He seemed very disappointed.&nbsp;<strong>He had been hoping to&nbsp;</strong>find Mr Worthing at home and&nbsp;<strong>had been planning</strong>&nbsp;to stay the night. I mentioned that you and Miss Prism were in the garden.&nbsp;He said he would like to talk to you for a moment.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Ask him to come here.</p> 
 <p><strong>Merriman</strong><br />Yes, Miss.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />I have never met a really wicked person before.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Algernon enters looking stylish and confident.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />You are my little cousin Cecily, I'm sure.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />You are mistaken.&nbsp;I am not little.&nbsp;In fact, I believe I am unusually tall for my age.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Oh, I'm sorry…</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />But I am your cousin Cecily.&nbsp;You are Uncle Jack's brother, my cousin Ernest, my&nbsp;<strong>wicked</strong>&nbsp;cousin Ernest.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Oh! I'm not really wicked at all, cousin Cecily.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />If you aren't, then you have been&nbsp;<strong>deceiving</strong>&nbsp;us all.&nbsp;I hope you haven't been leading&nbsp;<strong>a double life</strong>, pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Oh!&nbsp;Of course I have been rather&nbsp;<strong>reckless</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />I am glad to hear it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />In fact, now you mention it, I've been very bad in my own small way.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />I don't think you should be so proud of that, though I am sure it has been very pleasant.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />It is much pleasanter being here with you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />I can't understand why you are here at all.&nbsp;Uncle Jack isn't back until Monday afternoon.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />How disappointing! I have to go back to London early on Monday morning.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Well, I think you should wait till Uncle Jack arrives.&nbsp;I know he wants to speak to you about you&nbsp;<strong>emigrating</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />About me what?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />You emigrating.&nbsp;He's gone to London to buy you some clothes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I'm not happy about Jack buying my clothes. I don't like his style of ties at all.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />I don't think you'll need ties.&nbsp;Uncle Jack is sending you to Australia.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Australia!&nbsp;I'd sooner die.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Well, he said at dinner on Wednesday night, that you would have to choose between this world, the next world, and Australia.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Oh, well!&nbsp;I haven't heard very good things about Australia or the next world. This world is good enough for me, cousin Cecily.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Yes, but are you good enough for it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I'm afraid I'm not.&nbsp;That is why you have to&nbsp;<strong>reform</strong>&nbsp;me, cousin Cecily.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />I'm sorry, I don't have time this morning.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Well, will you have time to reform me this afternoon?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />I think&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;should try.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I will, but I will need a little something to eat first. I'm a little hungry.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily<br /></strong>How thoughtless of me!&nbsp;Won't you come in for something to eat?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Thank you.&nbsp;Could I have one of your flowers first?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily<br /></strong>Certainly.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I'd like a pink rose.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Why?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Because you are like a pink rose, cousin Cecily.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />I don't think it can be right for you to talk to me like that.&nbsp;Miss Prism never says such things to me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Then Miss Prism is a short-sighted old lady.&nbsp;You are the prettiest girl I ever saw.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Algernon and Cecily go up to the house. Miss Prism&nbsp;and&nbsp;Reverend Chasuble,&nbsp;who&nbsp;<strong>had been walking and discussing</strong>&nbsp;the advantages of marriage for single men, also return home. But someone else is now walking up the garden path. It's Jack! He's back early. He's dressed in black and looking very serious.</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />Mr Worthing! This is indeed a surprise.&nbsp;We thought you were coming back on Monday!</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />Dear Mr Worthing, I hope this black suit does not mean some terrible news?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />My brother.</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />Spending lots of money and running up&nbsp;<strong>debts&nbsp;</strong>again?</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />Still leading his life of pleasure?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Dead!</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />Your brother Ernest, dead?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Quite dead.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Jack has asked Gwendolen to marry him. She thinks his name is Ernest, her favourite name, and has happily accepted. But her mother, Lady Bracknell, is not pleased about the engagement. She wants to ask Jack some questions about his background and finances.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell<br /></strong>Now, Mr Worthing, I am quite prepared to add your name to my list of&nbsp;<strong>eligible</strong>&nbsp;young men for my daughter if you answer my questions in a suitable way... Do you smoke?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Well, yes, I do.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell<br /></strong>I'm glad to hear it. How old are you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Twenty-nine.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br />The&nbsp;<strong>best</strong>&nbsp;age to be married in my opinion.&nbsp;What is your&nbsp;<strong>income</strong>?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Between seven and eight thousand a year.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br />Seven and eight thousand. Do you own a house?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Well, I have a country house with some land.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />A country house!&nbsp;How many bedrooms? You have a town house, I hope?&nbsp;A girl like Gwendolen could not be expected to live in the country.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Well, I own a house in Belgrave Square, but I rent it to Lady Bloxham.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell<br /></strong>Very well. Now to&nbsp;<strong>more minor</strong>&nbsp;subjects.&nbsp;Are your parents living?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />I have lost both my parents.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br />To lose one parent, Mr Worthing, is unlucky; to lose both looks like carelessness.&nbsp;Who was your father?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />I'm afraid I don't know.&nbsp;The fact is, Lady Bracknell, I said I had lost my parents.&nbsp;It would be&nbsp;<strong>more truthful</strong>&nbsp;to say that my parents lost me... I was... well, I was found.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Found!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />The&nbsp;<strong>late</strong>&nbsp;Mr Cardew, one of <strong>the</strong>&nbsp;<strong>kindest</strong>&nbsp;<strong>gentlemen</strong>&nbsp;I've ever met, found me, and gave me the name of Worthing, because he happened to have a ticket for Worthing in his pocket at the time.&nbsp;Worthing is in&nbsp;<strong>Sussex</strong>.&nbsp;It's&nbsp;<strong>the most delightful</strong>&nbsp;seaside resort...<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Where did this kind gentleman find you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />In a handbag.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />A handbag?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Yes, Lady Bracknell, I was in a handbag - a rather large, black handbag, with&nbsp;<strong>handles </strong>to it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br />And where did Mr Cardew come across this ordinary handbag?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />In the&nbsp;<strong>cloakroom</strong>&nbsp;at Victoria Station.&nbsp;It was given to him by mistake instead of his own.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />The cloakroom at Victoria Station?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Yes.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell<br /></strong>Mr Worthing, I have to say I feel rather confused by what you have just told me.&nbsp;To start life in a bag, whether it had handles or not, shows a lack of respect for family life. As for the bag being found in a cloakroom at a railway station, that isn't&nbsp;<strong>the best</strong>&nbsp;way to begin a successful life in society today.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />May I ask you then what I should do? I would do anything to&nbsp;<strong>ensure</strong>&nbsp;Gwendolen's happiness.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />I would strongly advise you, Mr Worthing, to&nbsp;<strong>acquire&nbsp;</strong>some relations as soon as possible, and to try to produce at least one parent.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Well, I don't see how I can do that.&nbsp;I can produce the bag now.&nbsp;It's at home.&nbsp;That should be enough for you, surely, Lady Bracknell.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Mr Worthing! You can hardly imagine that I and Lord Bracknell would allow our only daughter to&nbsp;<strong>marry into</strong>&nbsp;a cloakroom, and&nbsp;<strong>form an alliance</strong>&nbsp;with a parcel?&nbsp;Goodbye, Mr Worthing!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Goodbye!&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />How did it go? Oh, didn't it go well, old boy?&nbsp;Did Gwendolen refuse you?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Oh, as far as Gwendolen is concerned, we are engaged.&nbsp;Her mother, though, is perfectly&nbsp;<strong>unbearable</strong>.&nbsp;She's a monster... I beg your pardon, Algy, I shouldn't talk about your aunt in that way in front of you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />My dear boy, I love people being rude about my relations.&nbsp;It's the only thing that makes me&nbsp;<strong>put up with</strong>&nbsp;them.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />You don't think Gwendolen could become like her mother, do you, Algy?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Gwendolen is&nbsp;<strong>the most sensible</strong>, intellectual girl I know. But all women become like their mothers. That is their&nbsp;<strong>tragedy</strong>. By the way, did you tell Gwendolen about being Ernest in town, and Jack in the country?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />My dear fellow, the truth isn't the sort of thing you tell a nice, sweet girl.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />What about your brother?&nbsp;What about Ernest?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Oh, I shall have finished with him by the weekend.&nbsp;I'll say he died in Paris from a severe cold.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />But I thought you said that... Cecily was interested in Ernest? Won't she be very sad?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Oh, that's all right.&nbsp;Cecily is not a silly romantic girl, I am glad to say.&nbsp;She has got a good appetite, goes on long walks, and pays little attention to her lessons.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I would like to see Cecily.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />I will take very good care you never do.&nbsp;She is very pretty, and she is only just eighteen.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Have you told Gwendolen about Cecily?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Oh!&nbsp;Cecily and Gwendolen are certain to be extremely good friends.&nbsp;Half an hour after they have met, they will be calling each other 'sister'.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Women only do that when they have called each other a lot of other things first.&nbsp;Now, my dear boy, if we want to get a good table at Willis's for dinner, we must go.&nbsp;It's nearly seven.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Just then, Gwendolen comes in and tells Jack that she will always love him, even if they don't get married. She asks him for his address in the country, and Algernon - listening quietly - secretly writes it down. Jack takes Gwendolen to her carriage and Algernon is left on his own, with a smile on his face.</p> 
 <p><em>(A bell rings)</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Lane<br /></strong>You called, sir.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Tomorrow, Lane, I'm going Bunburying.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lane<br /></strong>Yes, sir.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I'm going to Hertfordshire. I shall probably not be back until Monday. You can prepare all my Bunbury clothes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lane<br /></strong>Yes, sir.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I hope tomorrow will be a fine day, Lane.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lane<br /></strong>It never is, sir.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Lane, you are a perfect pessimist.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lane<br /></strong>I do&nbsp;<strong>my best</strong>&nbsp;to give satisfaction, sir.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Algernon has just asked his good friend Jack to explain why he calls himself Jack in the country but Ernest in London. Jack says it's because he is the&nbsp;<strong>guardian</strong>&nbsp;of a girl called Cecily, who lives with him in the country. She looks up to him and he feels he should behave well when he's with her, so he pretends he has a younger brother called Ernest so that when he comes up to London, he can enjoy himself.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon<br /></strong>So, Ernest, you are a&nbsp;<strong>Bunburyist</strong>!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>What on earth do you mean?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon<br /></strong>You have invented a very useful younger brother called Ernest, so that you can come to London as often as you like.&nbsp;I have invented a sick friend called Bunbury so that I can go to the country whenever I like.&nbsp;Bunbury is&nbsp;<strong>invaluable</strong>.&nbsp;For example, if Bunbury didn't have such bad health, I would have to have dinner with my aunt Lady Bracknell tonight. And I have no intention of doing that.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>Why not?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon<br /></strong>Well, to begin with, I had dinner with her on Monday - once a week is quite enough to eat with your own relations.&nbsp;Secondly, I know&nbsp;<strong>I will be seated&nbsp;</strong>next to Mary Farquhar, who always&nbsp;<strong>flirts</strong>&nbsp;with her own husband - most unpleasant! Besides, I want to have dinner with you and talk about Bunburyism.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>I'm not a... Bunburyist.&nbsp;In fact I think I am going to kill my brother Ernest. Cecily is a little too interested in him.&nbsp;And I strongly advise you to do the same with Mr... with your sick friend.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon<br /></strong><strong>I will not be separated</strong>&nbsp;from Bunbury... &nbsp;<em>(a bell rings)</em>&nbsp;Ah! That must be my aunt now.&nbsp;Now, if I keep her busy for ten minutes so you can&nbsp;<strong>propose&nbsp;</strong>to Gwendolen, will you have dinner with me tonight?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>Alright Algy...</p> 
 <p><strong>Lane<br /></strong>Lady Augusta Bracknell and Miss Gwendolen Fairfax.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>A well-dressed, elderly woman and her daughter, a pretty, young lady enter the room.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell<br /></strong>Good afternoon, dear Algernon. Oh, hello, Mr Worthing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>Hello, Lady...</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell<br /></strong>Now, Algernon... I'd like a nice cup of tea, and one of those cucumber sandwiches you promised me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon<br /></strong>Certainly, Aunt Augusta.&nbsp;Good heavens!&nbsp;Lane!&nbsp;Why are there no cucumber sandwiches?</p> 
 <p><strong>Lane<br /></strong>There were no cucumbers in the market this morning, sir.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon<br /></strong>No cucumbers!</p> 
 <p><strong>Lane<br /></strong>No, sir.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon<br /></strong>I am very sorry, Aunt Augusta.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell<br /></strong>It doesn't matter, Algernon.&nbsp;Pour me some tea.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon<br /></strong>Here you are.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell<br /></strong>Thank you.&nbsp;Now, Algernon, about tonight -&nbsp;<strong>you</strong>&nbsp;<strong>will be seated</strong>&nbsp;next to Mary Farquhar.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon<br /></strong>I'm afraid, Aunt Augusta, I won't be able to have dinner with you tonight.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell<br /></strong>But why not, Algernon?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon<br /></strong>Well, I have just heard that my poor friend Bunbury is very ill again. I'll have to go and see him.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell<br /></strong>It's very strange.&nbsp;This Mr Bunbury seems to have curiously bad health. I think it is time that he made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die. And I would be very grateful if you could ask Mr Bunbury to please not be ill on Saturday, because I need you to organise my music at my&nbsp;<strong>soir&eacute;e</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon<br /></strong>I'll speak to him, Aunt Augusta, and I'm sure he'll be well by Saturday. But why don't we go next door to look at the programme of music I've prepared.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell<br /></strong>Thank you, Algernon.&nbsp;It is very thoughtful of you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Algernon and his aunt go into the music room, leaving Jack and Gwendolen alone.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>It has been a lovely day, Miss Fairfax.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen<br /></strong>Please don't talk to me about the weather, Mr Worthing.&nbsp;Whenever people talk about the weather, I am sure they mean something else.&nbsp;And that makes me nervous.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>I do mean something else.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen<br /></strong>I thought so.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>Miss Fairfax, ever since I met you I have admired you...</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen<br /></strong>Yes, I realised that.&nbsp;Actually, I<strong>&nbsp;have always been fascinated&nbsp;</strong>by you... even before we met. &nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>Really?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen<br /></strong>Yes, I've always wanted to love someone called Ernest.&nbsp;That name&nbsp;<strong>inspires</strong>&nbsp;complete confidence.&nbsp;When Algernon first mentioned that he had a friend called Ernest, I knew&nbsp;I was<strong> destined&nbsp;</strong>to love you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>You really love me, Gwendolen?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen<br /></strong><strong>Passionately</strong>!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>But you don't really mean that you couldn't love me if my name wasn't Ernest?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen<br /></strong>But your name&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;Ernest.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>Yes, I know.&nbsp;But what if it was something else?&nbsp;Do you mean you couldn't love me then? Personally, I don't think the name suits me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen<br /></strong>It suits you perfectly.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>But there are lots of other much nicer names.&nbsp;Jack, for instance, is a charming name.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen<br /></strong>Jack? Oh, no, Jack does not have the same sound at all. It's not exciting. The only really safe name is Ernest.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>Gwendolen,&nbsp;<strong>I must get christened&nbsp;</strong>at once - I mean, we must get married at once.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen<br /></strong>Married, Mr Worthing?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>Well... surely.&nbsp;You know that I love you, and you led me to believe, Miss Fairfax, that you felt the same.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen<br /></strong>I adore you.&nbsp;But you haven't proposed to me yet.&nbsp;<strong>Nothing has been said</strong>&nbsp;at all about marriage.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>Well... may I propose to you now?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And so Jack&nbsp;<strong>kneels</strong>&nbsp;down and asks Gwendolen to marry him. She accepts and Jack is still on his knees when Lady Bracknell returns.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell<br /></strong>Mr Worthing! Do get up!&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen<br /></strong>Mamma!&nbsp;Please leave us.&nbsp;Mr Worthing has not quite finished yet.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell<br /></strong>Finished what, may I ask?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen<br /></strong><strong>I am engaged</strong>&nbsp;to Mr Worthing, mamma.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell<br /></strong>Pardon me, you are not engaged to anyone.&nbsp;When you do become engaged, I, or your father will tell you.&nbsp;<strong>A young girl should be surprised</strong>&nbsp;by an engagement, pleasantly or unpleasantly. It is not something that&nbsp;<strong>she is allowed</strong>&nbsp;to arrange for herself... And now I would like to ask you a few questions, Mr Worthing.&nbsp;Gwendolen, can you wait for me below in the carriage.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen<br /></strong>Mamma!</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Algernon Moncrieff, a wealthy young man from the upper classes of society, is passing the time playing the piano in his luxurious flat in central London. He's waiting for his aunt and cousin to&nbsp;come to&nbsp;tea. Algernon is a well-dressed and pleasant-looking man. His servant, Lane, is busy preparing the table.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Did you hear what I was playing, Lane?</p> 
 <p><strong>Lane</strong><br />I thought it would be rude to listen, sir.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Oh, that's a pity. Now, have you made the cucumber sandwiches yet for Lady Bracknell?&nbsp;<strong>They said they would be here at five.</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Lane</strong><br />Yes, sir. Here they are.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Oh! Good… By the way, Lane, I noticed eight bottles of champagne were drunk on Thursday night while I was having dinner with Mr Worthing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lane</strong><br />That's correct, sir.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Why do&nbsp;<strong>bachelors'</strong>&nbsp;servants always drink their champagne?</p> 
 <p><strong>Lane</strong><br />It's probably because a bachelor's wine is better than the wine you'd find in married families.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Good heavens! Is marriage as bad as that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Lane</strong><br /><strong>People tell me that it is very pleasant, sir</strong>. I don't have much experience. I've only been married once.</p> 
 <p><em>(a bell rings)</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Aha! That will be my dear aunt, Lady Bracknell…&nbsp;<strong>Tell her that I'm in the morning room</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />But it isn't Algernon's aunt. It's a young gentleman who follows Lane into the room. He's good-looking and has a serious expression on his face. Algernon is pleased, though surprised, to see him.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lane</strong><br />Mr Ernest Worthing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />How are you, my dear Ernest? What brings you to London?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Oh, pleasure of course!</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Where have you been since last Thursday?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />In the country.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br /><strong>What on earth</strong>&nbsp;do you do there?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />When you are in town you entertain yourself. When you are in the country you entertain other people. It is really quite boring.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />And who do you entertain?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Oh, neighbours.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Got nice neighbours where you live in&nbsp;<strong>Shropshire</strong>?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br /><strong>Perfectly horrid</strong>! Never speak to any of them.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />They must find you very entertaining, then!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Hello! Why all these cups? Why cucumber sandwiches? Who's coming to tea?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Oh! Just my aunt Lady Bracknell and… her daughter Gwendolen…</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />How wonderful!</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Yes, but Lady Bracknell won't&nbsp;<strong>approve</strong>&nbsp;of you being here.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Why not?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />My dear&nbsp;<strong>fellow</strong>, the way you&nbsp;<strong>flirt</strong>&nbsp;with Gwendolen is perfectly disgraceful. It's almost as bad as the way Gwendolen flirts with you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />I'm in love with Gwendolen. I've come to London to ask her to marry me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br /><strong>You told me you had come here for pleasure</strong>? I call that business.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />You are so unromantic!</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I really don't see anything romantic in&nbsp;<strong>proposing</strong>. It's very romantic to be in love. But there's nothing romantic about asking someone to marry you. They may accept you. Then the excitement is all over. If I ever get married, I'll certainly try to forget that I am.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />I'm sure you will, dear Algy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I don't think you will ever marry Gwendolen.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Why on earth do you say that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Well, in the first place, girls never marry the men they flirt with.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Oh, that's nonsense!</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />It's true. It explains why there are so many bachelors. In the second place, I won't give you my permission.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Your permission?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />My dear fellow, Gwendolen is my first cousin, and before I allow you to marry her, you will have to explain about… Cecily.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Cecily? What do you mean? Who is Cecily? I don't know any one called Cecily.</p> 
 <p>(A bell rings)</p> 
 <p><strong>Lane</strong><br />You called, sir?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Bring me that cigarette case Mr Worthing left here last Thursday.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lane</strong><br />Yes, sir.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Have you had my cigarette case all this time? I wish you'd told me. I've been to the police. I nearly offered a large reward.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Well, I wish you would. I'm quite&nbsp;<strong>hard up</strong>&nbsp;at the moment.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />There's no point offering a large reward now it's been found.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lane</strong><br />The cigarette case, sir.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I think that's rather mean of you, Ernest. However, it's not important now because according to the&nbsp;<strong>inscription</strong>&nbsp;inside, the case isn't yours anyway.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Of course it's mine. You've seen me use it hundreds of times. Now, could I have my cigarette case back?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Yes, but this isn't your cigarette case. It's a present from someone called Cecily, and you said you didn't know anyone of that name.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Well, actually, Cecily is my aunt.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Your aunt!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Yes. Lovely old lady she is, too. Lives in Tunbridge Wells.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />But why does she call herself &quot;little Cecily&quot; if she is your aunt? &quot;From little Cecily with her&nbsp;<strong>fondest</strong>&nbsp;love.&quot;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />What's wrong with that? Some aunts are tall, some are small.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Yes. But why does your aunt call you her uncle? &quot;From little Cecily, with her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack.&quot; There is no problem, I admit, to an aunt being small, but why should an aunt call her own nephew… uncle? Besides, your name isn't Jack. It's Ernest.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />It isn't Ernest. It's Jack.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />You have always told me it was Ernest. I have introduced you to everyone as Ernest. You look as if your name was Ernest. You are the most&nbsp;<strong>earnest</strong>-looking person I ever saw in my life – so honest and serious.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Ah yes, we should just say that the name Ernest was very common at the time, and the adjective 'earnest' – which sounds exactly the same - means, well, honest and serious.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Here, it's written on your card: &quot;Mr Ernest Worthing, B4, The Albany.&quot;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Well, my name is Ernest in town and Jack in the country, and the cigarette case was given to me in the country.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Yes, but that doesn't explain why your small Aunt Cecily calls you her dear uncle. Or why you have two names to start with. Come on, you'll have to explain.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>The Vicar of Altarnum has just told me he knows who murdered my uncle and aunt. I look at him in&nbsp;<strong>horror</strong>, and slowly, the awful truth becomes clear...</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Yes, Mary. I planned the&nbsp;<strong>wrecks</strong>. Your uncle followed my&nbsp;<strong>orders&nbsp;</strong>but they thought&nbsp;<em>he</em>&nbsp;was the leader. He loved that. No one knew about me. But then you came and asked questions.&nbsp;<strong>They had to die because of that</strong>... The end was near in any case. The fool got drunk on Christmas Eve. Well, you saw what happened... the whole country knew what he'd done. With a rope round his neck, he'd have told them about me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>At least my uncle didn't lie - he talked and dreamt about his crimes. You... you hid yours behind the cross and the face of a priest. But why are you telling me all this now?</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>I know you found the picture... I saw it had been moved. It frightened you, didn't it? &quot;Who is this strange man?&quot; you thought. Yes, Mary I am strange. Oh, but they listened to me in church and followed me like sheep.</p> 
 <p>Now, get ready. We've got to leave.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>We?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Yes, you're coming with me - you'll be a good&nbsp;<strong>companion</strong>. I've admired your courage since we first met.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>And if I don't come with you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>You're no fool, Mary. There are no houses nearby and your screams won't be heard.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>You know that I'll run away at the first village.</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>You won't be able to.&nbsp;<strong>There aren't any villages on the Cornish coast because of the steep cliffs</strong>... just birds, and when we're on the ship...</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>You're leaving England?</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Of course - we'll go to Spain, to Africa... Get ready now.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>I think quickly. I look at the clock... Jem will have reached the&nbsp;<strong>blacksmith</strong>&nbsp;and will know the truth.&nbsp;<strong>He'll realise I'm in serious danger so he will follow us</strong>... If I go with the vicar, at least I'll slow him down a bit, so Jem will have a chance to catch up...</p> 
 <p>I have no choice in any case.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
 <p>We cross the dark, empty moor quickly, avoiding the roads. The moon is hidden behind clouds... The Vicar has luck on his side.</p> 
 <p>As the ground becomes softer, we slow down... The&nbsp;<strong>marshes</strong>&nbsp;lie waiting. The Vicar knows, as I do, that&nbsp;<strong>one wrong step will result in a horrible death</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oh, where is Jem?</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Whoah! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>A wall of fog rises in front of us.</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>It's no good. We can't see anything. We'll have to wait until light. We'll sleep here... on these rocks, out of the wind.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>I&nbsp;<strong>drift in and out</strong>&nbsp;of sleep.</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Shhh! Be quiet!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>I'm woken by his cold hand on my mouth.</p> 
 <p>I can still hear the wind, but there is something else, too...</p> 
 <p>We leave the horses and he&nbsp;<strong>drags&nbsp;</strong>me higher and higher...</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I can't go any further.</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Stay here, then.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>The last I see of him - he's standing on a rock with his arms stretched out...</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>(gunshot) Aaaah!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>I look up. Jem is about 100 metres away behind a rock with a gun.</p> 
 <p>I haven't seen Jem since he shot the vicar. The Bassat family have been looking after me. They've asked me to stay and look after their children... but I&nbsp;<strong>long for</strong>&nbsp;the green fields and valleys of Helford. I'm walking for the last time on the moor. Tomorrow I'll go back and live quietly on the farm.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Someone is coming this way... but I can't see who because the sun is in my eyes...</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Hello Mary. I heard you're going to go and live at North Hill?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>They've asked me, but no... I'm going back to Helford tomorrow... And you, are you leaving Cornwall?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Yes, I'm going to start a new life... I've got my whole home with me here. I may go north. Perhaps I'll&nbsp;<strong>breed</strong>&nbsp;horses instead of stealing them. Come with me, Mary.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I miss my home in Helford... I want to see the trees and animals...</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Go then and live on your farm.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>That's not very kind.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>I speak unkindly to my horses when they're&nbsp;<strong>obstinate</strong>. it doesn't mean I don't love them. Well, I'll be on my way... Goodbye Mary.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Wait! Are you saying you love me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Maybe... It'll be a hard life.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I know, I'll take my chance... and we'll be together.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>So, I cross the moor for the last time - and for the first time, it looks beautiful in the sunshine. Behind me lies Jamaica Inn, empty, no more secrets - they have all been told... my new life is about to begin.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>I'm at the Vicar's house. I'm here because last night, when I returned to the inn, I found my uncle – dead... lying on the floor with a knife in his back. When Mr Bassat arrived with his men, they found my aunt's body upstairs... she'd also been&nbsp;<strong>stabbed</strong>.</p> 
 <p>The vicar suggested I stay with him. He came to the inn as soon as he read my note. He's not here. He left before I woke up.</p> 
 <p>While I've been waiting for him, I've been thinking about who the killer could be. Mr Bassat asked me if I had an idea who it was. I told him I didn't... but that's not true... I remember how Jem told me that he hated his brother... so they'll catch and hang him... or else he'll ride away, laughing at me. Either way, I know that I love him.</p> 
 <p>Strange how this room is so empty... No books, no paintings... Not like the vicar's house in Helford where I lived with my mother... His living room had pictures of smiling angels and village scenes... and piles of books on the desk.</p> 
 <p>There's nothing on this desk. I know... I'll write and ask if I can stay with him. Now, where's a pen and paper? Ah... in this drawer perhaps. That's&nbsp;<strong>odd!&nbsp;</strong>Nothing in the drawer, wait, there&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a piece of paper... oh but it's already got something on it... a picture – by the vicar &shy;&shy;– his initials are there. What a strange picture.</p> 
 <p>It makes me&nbsp;<strong>shiver</strong>... It's the village church with the vicar and his&nbsp;<strong>congregation</strong>... but all the people have got sheep's heads and look stupid. The vicar has drawn himself as a wolf but not an ordinary wolf, a laughing wolf... What does it mean...? Oh no! He's back... quick! I shut the drawer quickly and sit by the fire. I'm shaking.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oh, Vicar...</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Did I&nbsp;<strong>startle</strong>&nbsp;you? I'm sorry I was so long. My horse was&nbsp;<strong>lame</strong>. You must be hungry?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>I find it difficult to speak... The picture has shocked me. The vicar asks me to get the food from the kitchen. When I return, there are papers all over the desk. He's been burning letters.</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Don't you want to know what I've been doing today?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I'm sorry - I haven't thanked you for your kindness last night.&nbsp;<strong>If you hadn't taken me in, I wouldn't have had anywhere to stay.</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Well... I've been to North Hill. Mr Bassat invited me and others to discuss the murder.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Does Mr Bassat&nbsp;<strong>suspect</strong>&nbsp;anyone?</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>They've found the man, Harry... He can't be the murderer though.&nbsp;<strong>He would have been a suspect if he hadn't been locked up in the room by the bar for the last few days.</strong>&nbsp;But he said that someone else gave your uncle orders. This person must be the murderer. Don't you agree?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Well... er... Yes, I suppose...</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>It can't be one of the men. This person is clever. He must have come to the inn and he knows the moor well. He probably lives nearby. Did anyone like this come to the inn?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Er... no... I can't think...&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Why do you look so anxious, Mary? But I forgot... I saw a friend of yours today at North Hill.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I have no friends except you...</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>But you told me you went to Launceston with your uncle's brother...</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>I froze... I didn't know what to say...</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>He gave me a message for you. Tell her that &quot;I'm sorry&quot;. I...</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Jem was at North Hill? Why?</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Well, he's the dead man's brother. He wasn't upset, though...</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Was Mr Bassat asking him questions?</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>They've been talking all day. He's got brains - more than his brother. You told me he lives nearby, and steals horses?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>I can't look at him, but I feel his eyes studying my face... He knows the truth.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>What will they do to him, Mr Davey?</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>'Do'? What do you mean? I'm sure he won't be punished since he has helped them.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>'Helped'? I don't understand.</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Mary, it was Jem who&nbsp;<strong>informed</strong>&nbsp;Mr Bassat about his own brother. They left Launceston together after the horse market. Mr Bassat told him he could go free if he gave them&nbsp;<strong>proof&nbsp;</strong>about his brother and he did.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>I can't believe it... I was so sure...</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oh, Vicar, I'm such a fool... Where is Jem now?</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>He's gone to find the&nbsp;<strong>blacksmith</strong>... He found a&nbsp;<strong>nail</strong>&nbsp;in the field by the inn. It must belong to the killer's horse. Only one person went to the blacksmith yesterday...</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>How do you know?</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Because I know who that person was.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>His strange eyes are staring at me... I can't breathe! He knows who the murderer is!</p> 
 <p>Meet me in the next episode when I finally discover the shocking truth about who killed my aunt and uncle at Jamaica Inn. I am also in danger but who will come to my rescue?</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>My uncle is planning our escape from Jamaica Inn tonight. He's afraid that someone is coming to kill him – someone who has been giving him the orders to&nbsp;<strong>wreck&nbsp;</strong>ships. He thinks I'm resting in my room and he has locked my door. But I climbed out of the window and am&nbsp;<strong>hurrying</strong>&nbsp;to the vicar's house before my uncle discovers I've gone. The vicar will help me, I'm sure …</p> 
 <p>Ah there's the church and the&nbsp;<strong>vicarage.</strong>&nbsp;I can't see any lights, though.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Mr Davey… Mr Davey… It's Mary … Mary Yellan. No one's here…</p> 
 <p>Excuse me, is the vicar in the church? I've been knocking at the house but there's no answer.</p> 
 <p><strong>Woman<br /></strong>No, he left this morning and won't be back until tomorrow.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Are you sure? Oh… what shall I do?... I've got to find someone to help me…</p> 
 <p><strong>Woman<br /></strong>Why don't you go to Mr Bassat, the&nbsp;<strong>magistrate?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;He lives at North Hill, but it's four miles away.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I'll have to go there…But first… I must … write … a note for Mr Davey. Here… can you give this to him…?</p> 
 <p><strong>Woman<br /></strong>But you can't walk! – it's getting dark …</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong>&nbsp;<strong>narrating<br /></strong>In my note, I explained about the wreck and my uncle's plan to escape… I'll have to walk quickly to North Hill. If my uncle discovers I've gone, he'll know I've&nbsp;<strong>betrayed</strong>&nbsp;him and he'll kill me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I need to see Mr Bassat –&nbsp;<strong>it's urgent!</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Mrs Bassat<br /></strong>I'm afraid he's not here.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oh no!… If I don't see him, something&nbsp;<strong>terrible</strong>&nbsp;will happen!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mrs Bassat<br /></strong>It's not about the horses is it? … I know one was&nbsp;<strong>quite ill</strong>&nbsp;this morning…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>No … When will Mr Bassat be back?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mrs Bassat<br /></strong>I really don't know.&nbsp;<strong>Actually</strong>, I'm very&nbsp;<strong>worried</strong>. He knows a man called Joss Merlyn who's&nbsp;<strong>very dangerous</strong>, so he might be in&nbsp;<strong>serious</strong>&nbsp;danger.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>What do you mean?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mrs Bassat<br /></strong>My husband has&nbsp;<strong>suspected</strong>&nbsp;for a long time that's he committed&nbsp;<strong>serious</strong>&nbsp;crimes and this morning, he&nbsp;<strong>suddenly</strong>&nbsp;got&nbsp;<strong>proof</strong>. He's gone to Launceston to get men and will surround the Inn this evening… there may be fighting…but do you know this man Merlyn? Wait a moment…you are the girl my husband told me about, aren't you? Don't move…!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Don't… I won't hurt you… I came to tell Mr Bassat that my uncle is planning to escape tonight. But I've&nbsp;<strong>ruined</strong>&nbsp;your husband's plan. When my uncle sees I'm not in my room, he'll leave before your husband gets there…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mrs Bassat<br /></strong>I can see you're telling the truth. How can I help you…?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I must go back and help my aunt. I'm&nbsp;<strong>really</strong>&nbsp;worried about her… [puzzled and trying to work out] But how did Mr Bassat find out the truth so soon?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mrs Bassat<br /></strong>I've no idea.&nbsp;<strong>He left very suddenly</strong>&nbsp;… But you can't possibly walk back&nbsp;<strong>alone</strong>&nbsp;now – it's&nbsp;<strong>dark.</strong>&nbsp;Our servant, James, will&nbsp;<strong>see you home safely.</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Really … there's no need. I'm used to the roads at night…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>But she insisted… so I am once again on the road to Jamaica Inn. The moor is&nbsp;<strong>cold&nbsp;</strong>and still tonight… James has two guns and if I have to … I'll use one… There is the inn …</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>It looks like Mr Bassat hasn't got&nbsp;<strong>here yet</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;I must find my aunt… Perhaps they've&nbsp;<strong>already&nbsp;</strong>gone. I'll go in&nbsp;<strong>alone</strong>. Give me a gun James. If you hear a shot, then come.</p> 
 <p><strong>Strange</strong>… the house is dark… but the horses are still here. So they haven't gone yet! Unless they went&nbsp;<strong>on foot</strong>, but no… my aunt wouldn't have done that. How odd!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>The kitchen is&nbsp;<strong>empty.</strong>&nbsp;The fire is&nbsp;<strong>dead</strong>.&nbsp;Nothing but&nbsp;<strong>a deathly silence</strong>. I&nbsp;<strong>creep</strong>&nbsp;to the hall, terrified of meeting my uncle with a gun. [gasps!]</p> 
 <p><strong>A terrible sight</strong>&nbsp;is there before me… I turn and run&nbsp;<strong>as fast as I can</strong>…</p> 
 <p>Let's meet again in the next episode – after the shocking events of today I go to the&nbsp;<strong>safety&nbsp;</strong>of the vicar's house – he has&nbsp;<strong>something important</strong>&nbsp;to tell me, but what can it be?</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>It's morning…I have just woken up in my bed in Jamaica Inn. Memories of what I saw on Christmas Eve&nbsp;<strong>haunt&nbsp;</strong>me like a&nbsp;<strong>nightmare</strong>&nbsp;…</p> 
 <p>My uncle forced me to travel with him and his drunken men on Christmas Eve. I was so tired on the journey that while they were singing drunken songs, I fell asleep.</p> 
 <p><strong>When I woke up, they had gone</strong>. The carriage doors were locked, but I escaped through the window.</p> 
 <p><strong>They had brought me to the coast.</strong>&nbsp;It was a cold,&nbsp;<strong>misty</strong>&nbsp;night, but from where I was standing on the clifftop, I could see my uncle and his&nbsp;<strong>gang</strong>&nbsp;below on the shore, silent and still. They were watching the&nbsp;<strong>tide</strong>&nbsp;coming in, like a beast waiting to&nbsp;<strong>pounce</strong>.</p> 
 <p>The mist began to clear and a light appeared on a nearby cliff. At last!&nbsp;<strong>The officers the vicar had spoken about were coming!</strong>&nbsp;… But my hope disappeared quickly. &nbsp;… Another light appeared out at sea. This one was moving up and down… I realised then with horror what was happening. The light on the cliff was a&nbsp;<strong>trap</strong>!</p> 
 <p>A huge black shape appeared out of the darkness. Like a&nbsp;<strong>moth</strong>&nbsp;to a candle, the ship was heading for the rocks…</p> 
 <p>I remember now how I ran to the shore, how I screamed and shouted… but my uncle caught me and tied my hands so I couldn't move. I couldn't do anything except watch the disaster happen.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>The men splashed about in the water grabbing<strong>&nbsp;treasures that had fallen</strong>&nbsp;from the ship<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Bodies were floating on the water. The men fell on them and took everything of value … even rings on the fingers. Hours passed. Light was appearing in the sky. My uncle saw it too.</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Whoah!! … Stop everyone! Look!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>He pointed to the sky.</p> 
 <p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Just … going …&nbsp;to get …</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Leave it! … There's no time!… It's getting light … Get out of here!… … before it's too late.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>But no one was listening. They were greedily grabbing what they could.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong><strong>My uncle had fired his pistol</strong>&nbsp;in the air. The men looked up and saw the sky. Fear struck them and they ran up the beach, carrying what they could… They knew they had stayed too long. Morning was their enemy. … I was too weak to move, but my uncle picked me up and carried me… In the&nbsp;<strong>panic</strong>, the carriage overturned. That meant there was only one small cart for everyone's escape.</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Stand back!… I say stand back!…Harry, make sure no one moves… Shoot if necessary… I said…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>There was blood everywhere…two men lay still… I&nbsp;<strong>fainted</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>Mary, are you awake?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>How long have I been lying here?</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>Two days.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Why didn't you wake me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>Mary…I…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I've got to get up …</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>Where are you going? Your uncle is downstairs.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>He doesn't frighten me… I must go and find….</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>He's never been like this before. He's locked all the doors. He's afraid of someone … I don't know who…</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>Don't go down, Mary, he's got a gun…!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>All the doors and windows are&nbsp;<strong>bolted</strong>. My uncle is sitting in the kitchen…</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>I heard noises outside. Did you hear anything?...</p> 
 <p>He'll come… He warned me but I didn't listen…We didn't plan it this time.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>What do you mean? Who warned you? The officers?</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Them…? They can't touch me. They need&nbsp;<strong>proof</strong>&nbsp;and all they have is a broken ship and two bodies. I wasn't there, was I&nbsp; – I was at home with my wife and niece cosy by the fire… No, it's him… He'll murder us all…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I don't understand. My uncle planned the wrecks, didn't he… or did he? Was there someone else who gave the orders? Who is he so afraid of?</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>Why don't we get away quickly now?</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>You idiot! There are people everywhere who know what I've done. They'd like to see me hang … we'll stay till night time, when it's dark… We'll leave then!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>I go along with my uncle's plan, but in my mind I'm making other plans – I'll escape somehow and find the vicar…. He's my only hope....</p> 
 <p>Meet me in the next episode when things get even worse and I make a shocking discovery that will completely change my life at Jamaica Inn.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>I've hardly slept since my uncle's shocking&nbsp;<strong>confession</strong>&nbsp;- how he&nbsp;<strong>lures&nbsp;</strong>ships onto the rocks and drowns women and children. Today, however, I have escaped and am on my way with Jem to the horse market in Launceston.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem&nbsp;<br /></strong>It's Christmas Eve, Mary. Why so quiet? What's happened?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary&nbsp;<br /></strong>Nothing…</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>You look tired.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>My uncle has been drinking… and talking… I know about the&nbsp;<strong>wrecks,&nbsp;</strong>Jem.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>And you think&nbsp;<strong>I must be involved</strong>…?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>There are gaps in the story and you fit into them…</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem&nbsp;<br /></strong>So you think I watch men and women drown and then steal from their dead bodies? … I may have taken some&nbsp;<strong>tobacco</strong>&nbsp;sometimes from the inn… but I've never killed a man…&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>Can I believe him?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>If you don't believe me, why have you come with me today?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I like your bright eyes…<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Mrs Bassat<br /></strong>Look, James! That pony looks just like Beauty, except Beauty was grey… How much is she?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem&nbsp;<br /></strong>She's not for sale. I promised her to a friend.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mrs Bassat<br /></strong>How much does your friend want?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>30&nbsp;<strong>guineas</strong>.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mrs Bassatt<br /></strong>Well, I'm Mrs Bassat. I'd like to buy her for my children for Christmas. I'll give you 35.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>OK. She's yours.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mrs Bassat<br /></strong>Here... My man James will ride her home…&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem and Mary<br /></strong>[laughing…]&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Jem Merlyn, you should be ashamed!&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Quick Mary, stand under here… I'll keep you warm… We'll get&nbsp;<strong>soaked</strong>&nbsp;if we go back tonight. Stay with me in Launceston tonight.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>No, I've been&nbsp;<strong>foolish</strong>&nbsp;enough today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Alright… I'll get the horse… Wait here.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary&nbsp;<br /></strong>He is rude, a thief and a liar.&nbsp;<strong>He might even be a murderer</strong>. And yet, if he wasn't so much like his brother, I could fall in love with him…<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Mary&nbsp;<br /></strong>Where is he? He left over 30 minutes ago… I'll ask that horse seller over there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Excuse me, have you seen Jem Merlyn?</p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>The man with the black pony? I saw him with another man. They left in a&nbsp;<strong>carriage</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary&nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh no!&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>Did they discover that the pony was stolen? Now I'm sorry I didn't agree to stay in Launceston with him… He went to get the horse to take me home… and now he's gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary&nbsp;<br /></strong>What shall I do? Perhaps someone will let me sleep on their floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Hello Mary. What are you doing here on Christmas Eve?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oh, Vicar, it's you…&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Come, I'll take you home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>Once again I tell him my story … the market, Jem's disappearance… His glass eyes show no expression…&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>You are young… don't cry over him…&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Am I right that it's quiet at Jamaica Inn…?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>My uncle has been drinking. He talks… Vicar, do you know what&nbsp;<strong>wreckers</strong>&nbsp;are?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>I tell him what my uncle told me – about using lights to bring ships onto the rocks … the dead women and children… the stolen&nbsp;<strong>cargo</strong>…&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar</strong>&nbsp;<br />So your uncle talks when he is drunk, does he? … Well there won't be any more wrecks. The government is putting officers on the coast to keep watch.</p> 
 <p>I'll get off here. The driver will take you home. Goodnight, Mary.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary&nbsp;<br /></strong>What's happening…?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>A gun is pointing at me. I see a face I recognise – the eyes look crazy and mad…&nbsp;<strong>it can only be one person</strong>…&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss&nbsp;<br /></strong>Get out! Ahh, so you've come back! What do you think you're doing at this time of night… on the road! Been with a man, I suppose.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary&nbsp;<br /></strong>Don't touch me! You're a murderer and a thief and I've been to Launceston today to&nbsp;<strong>inform</strong>&nbsp;on you.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Get back, you fools! She's lying… Get the horse Harry. The wind has changed… We'll use it…</p> 
 <p>So, Mary, you think you can inform on me so I'll hang…</p> 
 <p>You're coming with us!&nbsp;<strong>We might not get far</strong>&nbsp;but we won't stay here waiting to be caught! Away!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>Where we are going, I don't know. But I can see from the look in my uncle's eyes that something very bad is going to happen.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Join me next time – and find out exactly how bad things get when I discover what Joss and his gang of bad men really get up to.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>There was nothing but a few&nbsp;<strong>sacks</strong>&nbsp;and the rope in the locked room. My uncle has returned and is very angry about Mr Bassat's visit. He&nbsp;<strong>storms</strong>&nbsp;<strong>out</strong>&nbsp;of the house and sets off across the moor. Suddenly I have a mad plan. I put on my shoes and follow him.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>He's walking too fast. I can't keep up. It's no good - he's disappeared! It's getting dark. I must go back… Do I go right or left here? I don't remember this stream… Oh no! I'm totally lost!</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Hello, what are you doing out on the moor?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I'm lost.</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Where are you going?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Jamaica Inn.</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>That's the other side of the moor - but you're&nbsp;<strong>exhausted</strong>! Come back with me. You can rest and I'll take you back.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />You're very kind.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>He looks strange. His hair is white, and his eyes are pale. His voice is young, though.</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>I'm Francis Davey, Vicar of Altarnun. Please, come.</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Are you feeling better now?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Yes, thank you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>He has white hair and his eyes are like a blind man's – and yet his voice is gentle.</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>It was lucky I ran into you. Why were you on the moor tonight?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>Suddenly I want to tell him everything.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>It's terrible! You've probably heard&nbsp;<strong>rumours.</strong>&nbsp;They come at night, with their wagons. That first night there were six or seven of them. They brought huge boxes -&nbsp;they put them in a room by the bar. A man was killed -&nbsp;I saw the rope! Oh! What have I done? I shouldn't have said anything!</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Don't worry –&nbsp;<strong>I won't tell anyone if you don't want me to</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>But what should I do?</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Wait. Watch your uncle.&nbsp;<strong>When the wagons come, tell me immediately</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>What about the man who was killed? Can't we do something about that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>I think not.&nbsp;<strong>If there was a body, the police would surely investigate</strong>&nbsp;– but that's unlikely now. Could it be your imagination? All you saw was a piece of rope.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I heard my uncle&nbsp;<strong>threaten</strong>&nbsp;him.</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>People threaten others every day. Listen: you can talk to me any time.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>He drives me home. My uncle has been drinking. He stays drunk for five days. Today it's sunny, so I am out on the moor again.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Where do these&nbsp;<strong>ponies</strong>&nbsp;come from?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Hey! Mary!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oh, hello!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>I didn't expect you so soon!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I didn't plan to come this way.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>So what's been happening at Jamaica Inn?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>We had a visit from Mr Bassat.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Did you now? How much do you know Mary?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I just want to get my aunt away. Your brother can drink himself to death for all I care.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>So the smuggling doesn't shock you? What about murder, though?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I don't know what you mean.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Why are you so silent, Mary? Even a child would know something was going on at Jamaica Inn. 'We're bad, us Merlyns - and Jem is the worst.' Is that what you're thinking?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Something like that, but I'm not afraid of you.&nbsp;<strong>I'd even like you if you didn't remind me of your brother</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>I'm better looking!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I must get back.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Are you coming with me to Launceston on Christmas Eve? I want to sell this pony.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong><strong>And if you're caught selling a stolen pony, I'll go to prison like you.</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>I won't be caught. Come, don't you like a bit of excitement?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Well... where shall we meet?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>It's late when I get back and my uncle is lying drunk in the kitchen, surrounded by empty bottles. My aunt is in bed.</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Who's there? Put away that knife!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Uncle Joss, it's me, Mary.</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Mary - where are they?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>There's no one here. What's wrong, Uncle Joss?</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>They can't hurt me now. They're all dead. Sit by me, Mary…&nbsp;It's this drink! I've killed men with my own hands. But&nbsp;<strong>when I'm drunk I'm afraid.</strong>&nbsp;I see them in my dreams, floating on the water... The ship: it was on the rocks but the water was flat and they were coming into the shore alive! We had to kill them all. One woman – she was holding on to some wood with her child. The water was only up to her shoulder. She cried out to me to help her: I took a stone and smashed her with it. I watched her and her child&nbsp;<strong>drown</strong>&nbsp;in four feet of water. We killed them all with stones and rocks.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>My blood turns cold, and I feel sick. My uncle is a murderer&nbsp;- that I suspected, but what he has just told me&nbsp;<strong>chills me to the bone.&nbsp;</strong>What terrible crime will he carry out next?</p> 
 <p>Join me in the next episode when I go to the horse market with Jem, but things don't go to plan.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>I now know that my uncle is involved in smuggling. I also&nbsp;<strong>suspect</strong>&nbsp;that he has murdered a man. But if I tell, my aunt will suffer, so I can't do anything. Today, I am alone cleaning the kitchen. But the quiet does not last...</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Who can that be?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator</strong><br />When I go in the bar, there's a man with a glass of beer. He looks familiar…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>What do you think you're doing? You can't help yourself to drink!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Are you the barmaid?&nbsp;<strong>Fill up</strong>&nbsp;my glass.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong><strong>Fill it up</strong>&nbsp;yourself. I'll tell Mr Merlyn you are here.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Don't&nbsp;<strong>bother -&nbsp;</strong>he won't want to see me…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Well, I can't stand here waiting.&nbsp;<strong>Pay up</strong>&nbsp;and you can go.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Do you order Joss around like that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>He's my uncle. Patience was my mother's sister. Now, I have work to do… uncle!</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Who the hell are you talking to? I told you to keep your mouth shut! Oh, it's you, Jem. What do you want? You can&nbsp;<strong>get on with</strong>&nbsp;your work, Mary…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>So that was Jem, my uncle's brother. He's got the same dark eyes and hair, but drink has not ruined his face – it's younger and more handsome.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Excuse me -&nbsp;I didn't expect to see a girl like you at Jamaica Inn.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>My mother died, so I came here. I'm glad she isn't alive to see how my aunt lives now. I&nbsp;try to help her in the house. What do you do?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>I steal horses.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oh! Aren't you afraid of being caught?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Not really. Listen, I'm being serious now. Jamaica Inn is no place for you with its ugly business. I can help you go to Bodmin.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I don't need help. I can&nbsp;<strong>look after</strong>&nbsp;myself.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Well... I'm going now. But remember – I live in Trewartha if you ever need me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>How can I trust him? He's a thief -&nbsp;and he's Joss's brother. The loneliness of my situation grips me again.</p> 
 <p>The men have returned. From my window, I can see them lifting heavy objects onto the wagons. These men are&nbsp;<strong>desperate</strong>&nbsp;and dangerous. And Jem…? Did he come to warn his brother that they were coming?</p> 
 <p>This morning, I'm doing the washing. My uncle is away, so I can almost feel the happiness I used to feel when I worked on the farm.</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>Mary!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>What is it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>Mr Bassat is here - &nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>magistrate,&nbsp;</strong>with another man. What are we going to do? He's never been before: he must know something.</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>What am I going to say?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>This is my chance to tell an officer about Joss - but look at my aunt. She is trembling and terrified.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Just say Joss is away.</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>Mary, you won't tell Mr Bassat about the wagons, will you? If anything happens to Joss, I'll kill myself.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Bassat<br /></strong>You took your time. Where's the landlord?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>He's not here. &nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Bassat<br /></strong>When will he be back?</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>He went out after breakfast. I don't know when he's&nbsp;<strong>getting back.</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Bassat<br /></strong><strong>Damn!&nbsp;</strong>Listen to me – your husband is giving this whole area - my land - a bad&nbsp;<strong>reputation</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>I don't know what you mean. We live a quiet life here&nbsp;- my niece will tell you!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Bassat<br /></strong>I'm not a fool. We'll look around now we are here.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>Mr Bassat is having a good look around the inn. He knows there is something hidden here.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Bassat<br /></strong>This place is a&nbsp;<strong>disgrace</strong>! Call yourself an inn! There isn't one clean room.</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>Mary, Mary -&nbsp;the room by the bar!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>We come to the locked room.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I'm afraid this room is locked.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Bassat<br /></strong>Why?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I don't know…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Bassat<br /></strong>Have you ever heard wheels and horses at night?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>No, never.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Bassat<br /></strong>Where is the key to the room?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>My uncle has it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Bassat<br /></strong>Well, we'll have to&nbsp;<strong>break down</strong>&nbsp;the door, then.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>I'm afraid. I hate lying to save my uncle -&nbsp;and part of me will be glad if they find&nbsp;<strong>evidence&nbsp;</strong>of his crimes. I remember the rope. But the fear of what might lie behind the door is clear in my aunt's eyes. For her, it would be the end.</p> 
 <p>In the next episode – I meet a man who I can talk to and tell him about the awful things I have seen – but can he be trusted?</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>I've not seen my uncle much since I arrived. I am glad because he's got a violent temper and treats my aunt badly. This morning, I've been exploring the country around the inn…</p> 
 <p>There is nothing but&nbsp;<strong>heather&nbsp;</strong>and grass for miles. In the distance I can see the&nbsp;<strong>marsh.&nbsp;</strong>It was in this wild and lonely land that my uncle lived as a boy with his two brothers. Last night he told me their story.</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>If you had lived here, you would have taken to drink, like I did… it makes you do things. I had a family once: a father, mother, two brothers, but&nbsp;<strong>each one of them</strong>&nbsp;disappeared one way or another. My father was&nbsp;<strong>hanged</strong>. He killed a man. My brother Jem is clever – but they'll catch him, too and hang him. My brother Matthew – well, he drowned in the marsh. They found him one summer when the marsh dried up…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator</strong><br />When I get back to the inn my uncle is there...</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Well, did you miss me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Did you have a nice trip?</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Nice,&nbsp;<strong>be</strong>&nbsp;<strong>damned</strong>. I've been riding for four days. There was a bit of money involved - that's all I care about.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Well, I'll go and help my aunt...</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>It's me you'll be helping tonight, in the bar...</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>It's Saturday night – the bar is crowded. The air is full of smoke and the smell of unwashed bodies.&nbsp;<strong>All of them</strong>&nbsp;are drunk. Some men are so drunk that they lie on the benches like dead men.</p> 
 <p><strong>Harry (man in bar)<br /></strong>Another pint…</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Hurry up there, girl.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Uncle, I cannot&nbsp;<strong>bear</strong>&nbsp;this. I'm going upstairs.</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Too good for us are you? Well it's almost midnight now. Go to your room and lock your door …</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oww! Let go of my wrist! You're hurting me!</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Hear this: Keep your mouth shut, and you won't get hurt - but if you start to ask...</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oh! What's that noise? It's coming from under my room…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>The moonlight pours into my room creating ghostly shadows. I creep over to the window. My uncle is below and I recognise other men from earlier this evening. There are four or five&nbsp;<strong>wagons.</strong>&nbsp;The men have been taking big boxes from them into the inn.</p> 
 <p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>That's the last of them.</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Good. Get going now. Be quick…</p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>What will you do about him?</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Don't worry. Harry and I will deal with him later…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>I understand now. They are&nbsp;<strong>smuggling!</strong>&nbsp;Jamaica Inn is a perfect place for it. But what's my uncle doing at the moment? I have to go and see…</p> 
 <p>As I get closer to the bar, I hear voices. I hide in the shadows.</p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>No, and no again – I will not be a part of it - that's murder you are talking about Mr Merlyn … killing&nbsp;<strong>innocent</strong>&nbsp;women and children – no!</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Not so fast! By God, you will do as I say. Another man said the same and he was hanging at the end of a rope a few minutes later! Harry – you go and lock the door behind you. I'll finish here…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>I feel sick. My heart has been beating so loudly, I am sure they have heard it. I go back to my room quietly…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>What shall I do? If I had a gun or a knife, I could perhaps hurt my uncle so that the man can escape…But I have nothing …I must do something, though ….</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>I creep downstairs again. The door to the bar is shut. There is silence. I suddenly know I have to open the door to find out.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>There's no one here! Just the tables and a few empty glasses…The door is open at the back. But wait… what's that hanging in the middle of the room? It's swinging… A rope hanging from a hook in the ceiling! But there's nothing on the end of it. What's happened to that man? I fear the worst…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator</strong><br />Next time we meet, an interesting visitor arrives at Jamaica Inn. But who is he and can he be trusted?</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>I have arrived at Jamaica Inn to live with my aunt. My uncle is landlord here. It's a cold and lonely place. I'm at the door and I'm waiting for someone to let me in…</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Who's there?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>It's me. Mary. Mary Yellan.</p> 
 <p>[Heavy door opening]</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Ah, so, you've arrived at last. Well, say hello to your Uncle Joss.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Where is my Aunt Patience?</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>What's the hurry? Don't you want to give me a big kiss first? Patience! She's here. [impatiently] Where are you, woman?</p> 
 <p>Patience! Where in hell is that woman?</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>I'm here. Is it the girl?</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>See for yourself.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>A woman with grey hair hurries towards me. In the candlelight her face is pale. She looks afraid.</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>Mary.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Aunt Patience - I am so glad to see you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>But she is unrecognisable. Her curls have gone and her happy smile also. I can see that&nbsp;<strong>she's been crying</strong>. This woman is old and anxious. She starts to cry.</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Stop&nbsp;<strong>whimpering</strong>, woman. Can't you see the girl is hungry! I'll take her things up to her room. If there's nothing to eat on the table when I come down, you'll soon have something to cry about.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>He lifts my heavy box as if it's a bag of feathers. He is huge with shoulders like those of a bear.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>The kitchen is full of smoke from the fire. There are&nbsp;<strong>stains</strong>&nbsp;on the stone floor and there's a strong smell of alcohol. On the table there are two empty bottles of&nbsp;<strong>brandy</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>You mustn't mind your Uncle Joss. Some people find him strange at first, but he is very&nbsp;<strong>respected</strong>&nbsp;here. Just yesterday he told me that a man stopped and told him how much he admired.</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Are you talking rubbish again woman? Sit down Mary. Eat. Listen, Mary. I'm in charge here and you'll do as I say. You'll serve the customers in the bar and help in the house. But if you open your mouth and&nbsp;<strong>squawk</strong>&nbsp;like a hen, you'll be sorry.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I'll help you like you say, but if you hurt my aunt, I'll tell and you'll be&nbsp;<strong>punished</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Patience, go and get me another bottle and be quick. Big words – maybe we're not so different, Mary. Here, drink this.This is my&nbsp;<strong>curse</strong>, Mary – drink.&nbsp;<strong>I've been drinking a little today but</strong>&nbsp;- Oh you'll see how we drink here some Saturdays – they hear the shouting and singing far away. People are afraid of me but I'm afraid of no one. Go to bed now.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>He suddenly grabs my wrist.</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Listen carefully. Some nights you'll hear wheels, footsteps and voices outside. You must stay in your room and put your blanket over your ears. If you ask questions, I'll break every bone in your body. Do you understand?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>My room is small and&nbsp;<strong>bare.&nbsp;</strong>Just a bed and a table with a broken mirror. I feel lonely and&nbsp;<strong>trapped&nbsp;</strong>like a bird in a cage. But it's not too late to run away. I&nbsp;<strong>creep</strong>&nbsp;down the dark passage.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>[to herself] Who's crying? It must be my aunt!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>I turn back. My uncle frightens me but I must stay and protect Aunt Patience.</p> 
 <p>I did not sleep well last night. My bed is hard and the blanket is thin. The house is quiet this morning. I'll look for a place to wash downstairs. Here is the bar. Ah, there's a passage here – maybe it's along here. A&nbsp;door – this must be the washroom.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>How strange – it's locked.</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>Mary! What are you doing?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Why is this room locked, Aunt Patience? What's in it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>My aunt looks quickly behind her and her eyes are like a frightened rabbit's.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Is it because of the people who come to the inn at night?</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>Mary. Mary.<strong>&nbsp;I've been worrying about how to tell you this</strong>. I must warn you. Bad things happen here. Men come at night and they go into that room with Joss. When you hear them, you must stay in your room. You must never ask me or your uncle about it again.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>What is in this room and why is my Aunt so scared? I'm not going to like it here but I must stay to support her and keep her safe. Next time we meet – I have to work in the bar of Jamaica Inn on Saturday night where I get to meet a group of rough and drunk men. Later that night there are some strange goings-on in the yard outside.&nbsp; What's going on at Jamaica Inn?</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>My name is Mary, Mary Yellan. I'm 23 years old.&nbsp;<strong>I'm not usually very brave, but I feel brave today.</strong>&nbsp;Here I am… on this long journey to Cornwall… on my own.&nbsp;<strong>I've left the farm</strong>&nbsp;where&nbsp;<strong>I've lived all my life</strong>. I wanted to stay there, but last week I made a promise to my dear Mother…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mother<br /></strong>[coughing/weak voice] Mary, my child… listen… I won't be in this world much longer.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Don't say that, Mother.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mother<br /></strong>It's true, Mary. But, before I go,&nbsp;<strong>I have only one wish</strong>…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Yes, Mother dear?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mother<br /></strong>When I die, promise me you will go and live with my sister, Patience.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>But why can't I stay here on the farm, here in Helford?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mother<br /></strong>You can't stay here alone.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>But&nbsp;<strong>I haven't seen Patience since I was a child</strong>!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mother<br /></strong>I know, but soon she will be the only family you have. [coughing]&nbsp;<strong>I have written to her. She has agreed</strong>&nbsp;that you can go and live with her and your uncle Joshua.&nbsp;<strong>They live on Bodmin Moor in Cornwall</strong>. Here, take her letter.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Bodmin Moor! But that's so far away!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>Mother died last Tuesday. The funeral was yesterday. We buried her next to Papa.&nbsp;<strong>Now, I'm on my way to my aunt's house.&nbsp; I've got the letter here</strong>…</p> 
 <p>[reading]<strong>&nbsp;Joss and I now live in Jamaica Inn</strong>, where he is&nbsp;<strong>landlord</strong>. It's on the road between Bodmin and Launceston…</p> 
 <p>This journey is so long! We have been travelling for hours. What a wild and lonely county Cornwall is. My only&nbsp;<strong>consolation&nbsp;</strong>is that I will see my aunt again after so many years. Oh how pretty she was with her golden hair and blue eyes! Always laughing, enjoying ourselves…</p> 
 <p>But&nbsp;<strong>I never visited her&nbsp;</strong>and I never met her husband either. … Ah, at last, I can see houses and people – this must be Bodmin town.</p> 
 <p>There is just me and one other traveller left. It's so cold and grey outside…&nbsp;<strong>The rain is lashing against the window</strong>. I wish it would stop! All I can see is mile upon mile of empty&nbsp;<strong>moorland</strong>. No trees… no houses… I wonder how many more hours we have to travel?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Excuse me, sir – is it much further?</p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong><strong>Where are you going?</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Jamaica Inn…&nbsp;<strong>Do you know it?</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>Maybe I do and maybe I don't… and&nbsp;<strong>why are you going there?</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I'm going to live there… with my aunt and uncle.</p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>That will be Joss Merlyn...&nbsp;<strong>People say that queer things go on at Jamaica Inn</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong><strong>What do you mean – queer?</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>It's just what they say. But&nbsp;<strong>respectable people don't go there any more</strong>. It's a lonely place.</p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>If I were you, Miss,&nbsp; I would go on to Launceston tonight and go back to Bodmin tomorrow.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>But I can't.<strong>&nbsp;My aunt and uncle are waiting for me.</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>Jamaica Inn is no place for a young woman.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I have nowhere else to go…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>What can he mean by 'queer things'?&nbsp;<strong>Why is he looking at me in that curious way?</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Driver<br /></strong>Whoa boy…! Slow now.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong><strong>Why have we stopped here</strong>&nbsp;– it's the middle of nowhere?</p> 
 <p><strong>Driver<br /></strong>Jamaica Inn! There you go Miss.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>But there's nothing here! Oh – what's that? There up on the&nbsp;<strong>moor</strong>&nbsp;- a dark building with tall chimneys. I can see a path to the door. There's a sign twisting in the wind. It says 'Jamaica Inn'.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>Suddenly&nbsp;<strong>I feel frightened. I want to climb back in the coach.</strong></p> 
 <p>Too late –&nbsp;<strong>it's already gone</strong>... I suppose my only choice now is to enter Jamaica Inn.</p> 
 <p>Next time we meet – I get to meet my Aunt Patience and Uncle Joss. I discover what a mean and scary man my uncle is. And I discover a locked room – what is inside? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"<p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>Day 73 – we were sailing through a huge hurricane when a massive wave hit us. Oh why did I <strong>try to sail</strong> through this storm? I was <strong>hoping to get</strong> back home in 80 days but that seems impossible now. I must make sure my crew is ok – I need them now more than ever…</em></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>Is everyone OK?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>Oh, ouch, my arm. Passepartout, are you OK down there?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>Where I am? Who am I?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>You're Passepartout – you're on a yacht and we were hit by a big wave.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>Oh yes… I knew that… of course… a big wave. Let me just get up… oh my legs… right, I need to inspect the damage.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>Well, Peggy the parrot seems OK.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>Hooray! Well the satnav is still working but there's a tear in the front sail and everything in the galley is underwater.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>I'm so sorry. I <strong>wanted to carry on</strong> through the storm – but I was wrong.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>It's OK Phil. I thought you were very courageous, very brave. Look we're still alive. We've just got to get back to London, and with the money you'll get, we… I mean you… can <strong>enjoy living</strong> the rest of your life.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>Oh Sophia, thank you, I'm so glad we found you.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>We won’t be going anywhere with this damage.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>We must try Passepartout – never give up!</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>I don't know where all my courage and determination has come from but I like it! We are now sailing across the Atlantic – it doesn't seem as big and scary anymore. We've sailed past the Azores – we couldn't <strong>stop to have</strong> a rest – and now we're not far from the coastline of Britain, but we've run into some thick fog and we can’t see where we're going. I can hear the foghorn of a lighthouse but we are all so tired, weary and exhausted from our trip that we're… falling… asleep.</em></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>What's that? We've hit something. We're sinking.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>Oh no, look, water, water. Abandon ship, abandon ship! Get the lifebelts.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>Quick, set off one of those emergency flares – we need help.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>Oh no, The Mermaid is sinking, farewell.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>We've <strong>failed to get back</strong> home in 80 days. Disaster! We didn’t reach the pub in London on time and we've lost Tom's yacht – the yacht I was <strong>supposed to win</strong> and then sell to make some money. But we're alive and we have been rescued by a lifeboat. It's taking us to shore where we can make our way to the station, catch a train to London and hopefully meet our friends in the Horse and Groom pub.</em></p> 
 <p><strong><span>John<br /></span></strong>Phil – goodness, we'd forgotten all about you. And you, Pete.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>We have been sailing around the world for 80 days… We’ve nearly faced death and you have forgotten about us?!</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Tom<br /></span></strong>He's just joking. It's great to see you again: let me get you a drink and you can tell me all about your adventure but, hold on, who's your new companion?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>This is Sophia – we met her in Sao Tome and she's helped us sail around the world.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Tom<br /></span></strong>Pleased to meet you Sophia.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>Sorry we're a day late.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Tom<br /></span></strong>A day late? You mean it's day 81? Oh well. In that case, the yacht is still mine. A bet is a bet!</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>Ahh… well, about that. Your yacht… The Mermaid… she's wonderful…. I mean, she was wonderful… we had an accident… we hit some rocks and sank.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Tom<br /></span></strong>You're joking?!</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>Errr… he's not.We sank off the coast of Cornwall this morning.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>Tom wasn't pleased to hear the news about his yacht. I <strong>was hoping to win</strong> our bet. But here we are, with no yacht and no money - and I have to write a story about how we <strong>failed to sail</strong> around the world in 80 days.</em></p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>Excuse me. Can everyone <strong>stop talking</strong> for a moment – I have an important announcement. I've just double-checked our route on the computer and I realised that at zero degrees west and zero degrees east we crossed the International Date Line.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Tom<br /></span></strong>Very interesting, Pete – but so what?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>Well when you cross that line you gain an extra day – that means today is only day 80, not day 81!</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>You're right Passepartout – today is day 80. We're on time! What would I do without you?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>So does that mean Phil has won the challenge after all?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Tom<br /></span></strong>Well… erm… I suppose so. You went around the world in 80 days – but did you <strong>stop to collect</strong> the things on your challenge list?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>I… we got them all. Look… Morna music from Cape Verde, cacao beans from Sao Tome, Bourbon Pointu coffee from Reunion Island, a conch shell from… well we don't know where really, a Savi mask from Papua New Guinea, and a pahu drum from Tahiti.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Tom<br /></span></strong>Impressive! Congratulations – but I'm afraid you still don’t get a prize – that was my yacht, and you sank it.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>It's OK. I don't really need it. I've decided there's something much more important. Sophia… I'm so glad we rescued you… I've grown very fond of you and I <strong>don’t want to lose</strong> you… I know it's going to be complicated but… will you marry me?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>Oh gosh… well, yes! You're my hero – give me a kiss.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>Oh dear… I suppose I <strong>get to keep</strong> the parrot?</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>Dear Diary – My adventure is going to make a great story. I'm <strong>hoping to sell</strong> lots of books this time. Sometimes you need a big adventure to change your life. Even when your journey doesn't go to plan you just learn so much. Luckily for me, I've won a great prize – a loyal friend in Passepartout, and Sophia, a new friend and wife. It's good to be home.</em></p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>It's day 61 – and it's a miracle! I didn't hit any rocks and we're safe in the harbour at Papeete on the island of Tahiti. It’s just a quick stop to clean up the yacht and take on fresh water. <strong>I'm going to find</strong> one more souvenir to take home as part of my challenge – some type of musical instrument – hmmm. And how are my travelling companions? Well, they're not under the weather anymore – I mean, they aren't feeling ill – they've recovered from the food poisoning that I unfortunately gave them – but strangely, they still seem very pleased with me.</em></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>'Aloha' Phil! There you are, we were looking for you.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>Hi. I thought you two should rest, so I went off to buy something. Look, I've bought a 'pahu' – it's a traditional Tahitian drum. I need some kind of exotic instrument as part of my challenge – so here we go. And my credit card works here, so I’ve bought us all some colourful Polynesian shirts – don't they look great?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>Brilliant – Ilove the palm trees…</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>I suppose I could wear it at sea where nobody could see me.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>And I’ve got some food for Peggy. Now look you two, I'm really sorry about the lobsters and…</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>Be quiet Phil! In fact, well done – you're my hero. You did really well sailing the yacht all by yourself.&nbsp; Look, I found this old captain's hat the back of a drawer in the galley – go on Phil, put it on. You're in charge now! Let me take a photograph. I'm going to put that on Facebook.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>Yes, well done old chap. You've proved me wrong – you're not as useless as you look! Just don't cook us any more of your 'special meals'…</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>OK, I'll stick to making the tea.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>Perhaps you could sail us home now?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>I think we should work together as a team. I'd love to stay here for longer – it's so beautiful… but we have a job to do. We need to set sail and head for the Panama Canal.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP and Sophia<br /></span></strong>Aye-aye, captain!</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>He's not really in charge, is he?</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>Day 65 and we've had the wind in our sails. We're now passing through the Panama Canal. It's an incredible construction and luckily for us saves us thousands of kilometres of sailing around South America. We're not cheating – we are still sailing around the world – but will we do it in 80 days? My companions seem quite confident…</em></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>Phil, <strong>what are you going to spend all the money on when you get home</strong>?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>Maybe you could pay me a bit more? Or buy a few more drinks in the pub?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>I haven't thought about it and anyway, we've got to win this race first, which is looking very unlikely. But I <strong>am going to write</strong> about our adventures and I hope that this time, someone will buy my book. What about you Sophia, <strong>what are you going to do</strong>?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>I really don't know. I sold everything to pay for my trip. I'm going to have to find somewhere to live as soon as I get back to the UK.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>Don't worry Sophia. Phil has a sofa you can sleep on! There's room for that parrot too. And <strong>I'm going to start</strong> looking for a new job as soon as we get home – Captain of the QE2 maybe?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>Ah look, we're finally out of the canal. This must be the Caribbean Sea. It's beautiful and it's calm too – there aren't any waves. Look, it looks like a swimming pool.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>That's because there's no wind. We'll have to use the engine for a while until the wind gets up.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>Day 71 – it's windy. Very, very windy. A radio message has warned us of a hurricane heading our way. The sea is already getting rough. It's time to batten down the hatches and prepare for another very bumpy ride. I'm getting quite used to this!</em></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>This is wild! We've got to change course – find some shelter.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>Yes, you're right. Our sails will just rip to pieces in this weather.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>No – I think we should carry on. We've been in worse seas than this. And we can't waste any more time. Come on everyone, we can't let this little storm beat us. <strong>We're going to get through this</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>Are you feeling ok Phil?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>I'm feeling great.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>For once I feel like I know what I'm doing. I'm not scared. I’ve got Passepartout, Sophia and our lucky parrot Peggy with me –and that makes me think <strong>everything is going to be ok</strong>. I hope I'm right!</em></p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>OK Phil, maybe it's the captain's hat - but you really are a changed man. Come on then, let's ride this storm.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>Hold on tight – there's a huge wave coming.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>All<br /></span></strong>Whoooahhhh!</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>It's day 50. We've made it to Papua New Guinea and <strong>the capital city</strong> of Port Moresby. <strong>People</strong> here seem to be wearing <strong>masks</strong> – I think there's some kind of festival going on. Anyway, this is where we're getting out yacht properly fixed. It needs to be good enough for <strong>the next part of our journey</strong>. We've decided to sail in a straight line across the Pacific Ocean and then, well, we're taking <strong>a short cut</strong> through <strong>the Panama Canal</strong>. It's a long, long way so we need plenty of <strong>supplies</strong> … but there's <strong>a problem</strong>…</em></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>What's wrong Sophia? You look a bit worried.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>Well I've got all our supplies – <strong>milk, water, bread, tea, bird food</strong> for <strong>the parrot</strong> – but I haven't got any money to pay for them. We left <strong>Sao Tome</strong> in such a rush that I didn't bring any.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>Don't worry – here, use my credit card.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>They don't take <strong>credit cards</strong> here… just cash.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>Oh really? I don't have much cash either – we could get some wired over to us or maybe Passepartout…</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>Well don't look at me – I haven't got any cash – I've just used all my money to buy this <em>Savi</em> mask – isn't it beautiful? <strong>A real work of art.</strong> You need to collect one for your challenge, don't you?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>Yes I do - well done. Well, if we haven’t got any cash, we’ll have to sell some of our things. How about <strong>the parrot</strong>?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>We can't do that – I've given it <strong>a name</strong> – <strong>Peggy</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>That's <strong>a nice name</strong> Sophia. So, no, we cannot sell <strong>Peggy</strong>. I'll find some books and clothes and things to sell.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>We've made some money and we’ve got some food and drink. We even had some money left over to buy some lobsters and wine. I'm going to cook <strong>a slap-up meal</strong> for <strong>the crew</strong> – but not yet: I'm going to wait until we've sailed for a few days and we're all feeling a bit tired. So off we go again – let's hope <strong>the wind</strong> is behind us.</em></p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>Right, shall we take turns to work and sleep? This time, two people can stay on deck while one of us sleeps. <strong>The parrot</strong> can do what he wants. We don't want any more little accidents, do we Sophia?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>Ha ha, very funny. Look, I'll get all <strong>the sails</strong> up – with this wind behind us we should make up some time – just steer us in <strong>the right direction!</strong> And Phil, are you OK down there in <strong>the galley</strong>?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>Oh yes fine, I'm just cooking us something special to say 'thank you' for all your hard work.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>You know <strong>the way </strong>to<strong> a woman's heart</strong> is through her stomach!</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>Hmm, aren't those lobsters we bought getting a bit old? Maybe we should eat <strong>the parrot</strong> instead?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>Everyone's tucking into my meal of boiled lobster, fried potatoes and <strong>a pineapple salad</strong> with <strong>white wine</strong> to drink. For <strong>dessert</strong> I'm serving up fresh coconut. It's amazing what you can cook in such a small kitchen. I'm quite pleased with myself and they seem to be enjoying it but of course, Passepartout is complaining again… as usual…</em></p> 
 <p><strong>PP<br /></strong><strong>An interesting meal</strong> Phil – but was <strong>the lobster</strong> cooked properly? It had a funny taste and… to be honest… I'm feeling rather… sick.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>Too much wine I expect!</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>He's right… Phil… there was something… funny… I'm going to be… sick.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>Oh dear. I feel fine – but that's because there wasn't enough lobster for me to eat. Ermm… are you both ok?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP and Sophia<br /></span></strong>No!</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>Take charge… you need to sail <strong>the yacht.</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>Food poisoning! I've made <strong>the crew</strong> ill and now I'm <strong>the only person</strong> well enough to sail <strong>the yacht.</strong> Now stay calm Phil, I can do this. I can do this. Peggy, do you know how to sail? Of course not, you're <strong>a parrot</strong>. Right, I'm going east and heading for <strong>land </strong>at 17 degrees south, 149 degrees west. There's <strong>a dirty mark</strong> on <strong>the map</strong> so I can't see what <strong>the place</strong> is called. Oh no, <strong>the weather</strong> is getting stormy but I can do this – I need to show Sophia and Passepartout I can sail this yacht by myself so here goes…</em></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>Ah Passepartout, how are you feeling?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>A little better. Sophia's in <strong>the toilet</strong>: she's still feeling bad. Oh, well done for sailing <strong>the yacht</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>Oh, it's quite easy with a bit of practice. But <strong>the wind</strong>'s getting stronger and there's <strong>a storm</strong> coming – could you help move some of <strong>the sails</strong> around… please?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>I'm afraid… I can't.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>Oh well, hold tight everyone, I'm going to have to do this alone. I think I can see <strong>land</strong>… but oh no, I can see some <strong>rocks</strong> too… maybe I should close my eyes.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>Phil, pull that rope there…</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>How did I end up in this situation? I'm sailing <strong>a yacht</strong>, by myself, in <strong>a storm</strong>. I'm going to hit <strong>the rocks</strong>, I'm sure I am. First I poison <strong>the crew</strong>; now I'm going to drown them too. Where is <strong>this harbour</strong>? Oh, I want to go <strong>home</strong>!</em></p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>Hello again. It's day 45. <strong>Passepartout and I were sleeping like babies when we suddenly heard </strong>a loud creaking and cracking sound. What could it be? We're in the middle of the Indian Ocean so we can't have hit any rocks. Sophia is up on deck steering the yacht – I need to find out what's going on.</em></p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>Err… what's all that noise? <strong>I was having a wonderful dream – I was saving</strong> the Titanic from hitting an iceberg…</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>Passepartout, something's happened.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>What? Err, where's this water coming from?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>I'm going up to the deck… Sophia, Sophia, what was that noise? Sophia? Where's Sophia?! She's not here!</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>Out of the way, let me have a look… No, she's definitely gone… but hold on, look, we've been swept onto a beach.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>We're shipwrecked!</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>We've landed on a huge, yellow, sandy beach. And beyond the beach there's a line of palm trees – with coconuts growing on them. It looks like some kind of tropical island. Our satnav says we are at 11 degrees south, 100 degrees east - but according to the map there shouldn’t be any land at this location. Why are we here, and where is Sophia?</em></p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>Phil look, there's a hole in the yacht – that's why the water's coming in.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>Oh no – what are we going to do? We're castaways, stuck here forever.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>Of course we're not. Just go and collect some palm leaves and a few bits of driftwood. <strong>Luckily I learnt some yacht repair skills from a TV programme I watched.</strong> I should be able to patch her up.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>Aye-aye captain. We need to get back to sea as soon as possible to look for Sophia.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong><span>Hmm, I don't think we'll see her again. The ocean is huge: it's like looking for a needle in a haystack.</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>But, we must try.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>We can't give up on Sophia now. I've collected all the bits that Passepartout needs for the repairs. I've made a small fire so I can boil some water and make some much-needed tea. <strong>Whilst I was beachcombing I found a beautiful shell.</strong> According to my encyclopaedia, it is a rare type of conch shell. That's lucky – it is one of the things I need to collect as part of my challenge. Hmm, that's one bit of good news in a sea of bad news. Right, I just need to take a few photos before we go to put on my travel blog…</em></p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>OK, the yacht is fixed, well sort of – give me a hand to scoop out the water that got inside. We'll need to head for somewhere where we can get some proper repairs done. But I think we can be on our way. You just need to help me push her out to sea. Here goes…</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>…. Jump on Phil. I'll get the sails up and we'll be on our way.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>Hey look Passepartout – we've picked up a stowaway. A parrot!</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>Hmm, wonderful, now I've got someone I can have a proper conversation with!</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>I think we should keep it – it might bring us some good luck.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>If you say so. Now look, according to our map, I think we'll miss Indonesia and head for Papua New Guinea. With a good tail-wind we should be there… mmm… tomorrow – yes?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>No Passepartout! We need to sail around here first to search for Sophia. She can't be far away – maybe <strong>she fell off when we hit the beach</strong>?Hey, I think it's seen something. Quick - where are the binoculars?&nbsp; There! I can see something.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>Sure enough – the parrot has seen something. We've got closer and yes! It is Sophia – she's floating on some kind of shipping container. I thought she was gone forever, but she's back – and I'm so happy.</em></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>Phil, Passepartout, over here. Throw me a rope. Oh I'm so pleased to see you again.Oh I'm so hungry and thirsty. I'm so sorry. <strong>I fell asleep and a big wave threw me overboard.</strong> <strong>I tried</strong> to call out… but <strong>you didn’t hear me. I saw that old container and swam towards it. I was drifting about on it</strong> – I thought I would never see you again – I thought I was going to die – but Phil, <strong>you saved me</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>Well… I did, didn't I? But <strong>Passepartout helped me</strong> too, I think. <strong>He fixed the boat</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>Oh yes, well done – and who is your new friend?<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>Just some parrot. <strong>It decided</strong> to perch on our yacht. It hasn't got a name yet but I suppose it can join us for this trip.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>Ah, he's cute… I'll try and think of a name. In the meantime, how about some of that wonderful tea Phil? Come on Passepartout, we've no time to waste, we've got to get moving if we're going to win this race.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>Yes, yes, I know that.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>The team is back together. I'm so pleased <strong>we found Sophia</strong> – although I'm not so sure Passepartout is. We <strong>were making very good progress until we got shipwrecked. That cost us a lot of time</strong> and now, only hard work and good luck will get us back to London in 80 days. Our next stop is Papua New Guinea, where we can finish repairing The Mermaid. But how long will that take? Time is running out.</em></p>

"<p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>Day 38 – Disaster! Our yacht has been stolen. We were on Reunion Island when someone<strong> cut</strong> the ropes and <strong>took</strong> it. Where is it – and how are we going to find it? Does this mean we're going to lose the race?</em></p> 
 <p><strong>PP<br /></strong>Well that's it then. We might as well give up and go home.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>We can't stop now – we're having so much fun. And anyway, we can't go home without our yacht. Oh look, there's that man who gave me the coffee beans. Maybe he can help…</p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>Hello, how's the satnav now? All working?</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>Well, err, yes – it's working, thank you very much. But we have another slight, little problem. We haven't got a yacht to put it on anymore.</p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>Really?</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>Yes, I'm afraid so. It looks like it's been <strong>stolen</strong>… you know,<strong> pinched</strong>… <strong>nicked.</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>Surely not. This sort of thing doesn't happen around here. It must be… pirates!</p> 
 <p><strong>Sophia<br /></strong>Pirates! Real-life pirates?</p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>Yes, they do exist but they’re not like the pirates in stories. They will steal almost anything and they are very, very dangerous. But we must get your boat back so let's hope these pirates aren't too bad. Come on, let's use my fishing boat and go looking for your missing yacht. They can't be very far away.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>The man who <strong>gave</strong> me the coffee beans is taking us out to sea in his fishing boat. But how are we going to find our yacht? Pirates are lawless and will do anything to protect their bounty – but why does it have to be our yacht? Oh, it could be anywhere now. But hold on… what is it? I think Passepartout has seen something…</em></p> 
 <p><strong>PP<br /></strong>Over there, look! That's our yacht… and I think I can see one… two people on board. Let's hope they haven't sabotaged our yacht.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>What are we going to do? We don't want to get too close – they might have guns.</p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>OK, we need to slow down and approach carefully. Let me just look through my binoculars to see if they have guns… hold on! They look familiar.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>Do you know them?</p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>Errr… yes! I do.</p> 
 <p><strong>Sophia<br /></strong>Are they dangerous?</p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>Absolutely not. They are not fearsome pirates: I used to play with them in the island football team. They <strong>didn’t score</strong> any goals then and they're not going to sabotage your journey now. Come on, let's get your boat back.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>PP<br /></strong>It's a yacht!</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>We've caught up with our yacht – The Mermaid – and the would-be pirates have given it back to us, and we <strong>got </strong>an apology. These guys <strong>were</strong> 'joyriders' – they <strong>stole</strong> our boat just for a bit of fun – luckily they <strong>didn’t cause</strong> much damage but they've almost ruined our chances of getting back to London on time.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>So sorry again about these guys. I will make sure they pay for what they <strong>did</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>Farewell and thanks for your help.</p> 
 <p><strong>PP<br /></strong>Well, that <strong>was</strong> a real adventure – now can we get back on course and try and make up for lost time? We have a long way to go.</p> 
 <p><strong>Sophia<br /></strong>Passepartout, don't forget it <strong>was</strong> you who <strong>hit</strong> his head and <strong>had </strong>to go to hospital remember?</p> 
 <p><strong>PP<br /></strong>Err, well, I think it was you who<strong> sailed</strong> us 500 miles in the wrong direction.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>Will you two just stop it – we all need to get on and try and work out how we're going to win this challenge and get back to London on time.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Sophia<br /></strong>Don't worry Phil, it's easy – if we head south we'll pick up some trade winds – that will make us much faster. We'll get to Indonesia in just a few days.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>Sounds like a plan. Passepartout?</p> 
 <p><strong>PP<br /></strong>Fine by me. But we've got a long, long way to go – I think we'll need to take turns in sailing while the other two get some sleep.</p> 
 <p><strong>Sophia<br /></strong>Good idea. I'll steer first and get us back on course. You guys get some sleep – it's been a long and busy day. First Phil, perhaps you can make some of that delicious tea you're good at making, hmm?</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>Aye-aye captain! I've always <strong>wanted</strong> to say that. Right away Sophia.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>Making tea! It seems to be the only thing I'm good at doing on this yacht. Ah well, if it keeps the crew happy! Well, we're out in the middle of the Indian Ocean now and we have the wind in our sails. Sophia is on deck and Passepartout is here asleep – you can probably hear him snoring! Actually, I'm feeling… quite sleepy… now. The rolling of the yacht on the waves seems to be rocking me to sleep… like a baby. Maybe I… should get some sleep before… I have to steer… the yacht.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>PP<br /></strong>What? Huh? What was that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>I think we've hit something – but what?</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>All<br /></strong>Wooah! Watch out!</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>That was close.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>Day 35 - we've just missed being hit by a huge container ship. We're all so tired and we didn't see it coming. We've been at sea for several days and without our satellite navigation system it's hard to know which way we're going. Passepartout needs medical help and <strong>we</strong> <strong>have to</strong> <strong>get</strong> more food supplies. <strong>We</strong> <strong>must</strong> <strong>find</strong> land soon…</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Sophia<br /></strong>Land ahoy!</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>Land? Really? At last! Come on. Let's head for the harbour and find a hospital quickly.</p> 
 <p><strong>Passepartout<br /></strong>Oh, my head.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>We're on dry land. It's such a great feeling after just looking at endless water day after day. But where are we? People are speaking French and there's a wonderful smell of fresh coffee in the air. Anyway, we mustn’t waste any more time. Sophia is taking Passepartout to a hospital to see a doctor about the cut on his head. <strong>I</strong> <strong>have to</strong> <strong>get</strong> our satnav fixed and purchase some more supplies for the next leg of our journey. And <strong>I</strong> <strong>must</strong> <strong>take</strong> some photographs too to put on my travel blog. But wait a minute, I don't know where I am! Time for a walk I think…</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>Excuse me young man – that coffee smells wonderful.</p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>Oh this is <em>Bourbon Pointu</em> coffee. It's the best in the world and you can only get it here.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>And where is here?</p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>Reunion Island.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>Reunion Island! So that's where we are. Goodness, we really have gone off course!</p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>Where are you heading?</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>We're supposed to be sailing around the world – but we got lost when our satnav broke.</p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>Oh <strong>you</strong> <strong>don't have to</strong> <strong>worry</strong> about that, my brother fixes gadgets. I'm sure he can help. Let me take it for you and if you come back at 4 o'clock it will be ready. Hopefully!</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>Brilliant. And while I'm here can I buy some of those beans?</p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>Sure. Here, take some coffee beans as a present from me to you – and remember your visit to Reunion.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil</strong><br /><strong><em>I</em></strong><em> <strong>had to bring</strong> home some unique and special coffee beans as part of the challenge, so this is gift is perfect. But we have a long way to go; <strong>we</strong> <strong>mustn't</strong> <strong>waste</strong> any more time. <strong>I</strong> <strong>must</strong> <strong>get on</strong> with the shopping, wait for our satnav to be fixed and hope that Passepartout will be ok.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Sophia<br /></strong>Phil, Phil… we're back. Passepartout has got some stitches in his head. But I think he'll be fine…</p> 
 <p><strong>Passepartout<br /></strong>Oh will I? You're the expert now? Maybe if you leave me to sail our yacht we won't have any more little accidents?</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>Come on Passepartout, let's all try to get on shall we? I know how useful you are – but Sophia got us safely through to Reunion. Come along – let's all be friends. OK?</p> 
 <p><strong>Passepartout<br /></strong>OK then. How's the satnav?</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>It's fixed and it didn't cost much. Look, if I switch it on… I can tell you exactly where we are: 21 degrees south, 55 degrees east.</p> 
 <p><strong>Sophia<br /></strong>Impressive!</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>Yes, and look, I've got some special coffee to take home. Bourbon Pointu.</p> 
 <p><strong>Sophia<br /></strong>Another one of your 'souvenirs'!&nbsp; Come on, <strong>we</strong> <strong>must get going</strong> – the weather forecast says there's a big storm coming and <strong>we have to avoid</strong> it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>Yes, good idea. We can't waste any more time. Let's get back to the harbour. Passepartout, could you carry these bags of food please… they're… quite heavy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Sophia<br /></strong>Isn't this where we left the yacht – between these two other boats?</p> 
 <p><strong>Passepartout<br /></strong>Are you sure Sophia? We did arrive in a rush.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>No, it was definitely here. In fact – look – these are our ropes. They've been cut. I don't believe it but I think our yacht has been stolen.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>Stolen! It couldn't get any worse. We're stuck halfway around the world with no yacht. There is no way we can get round the world in 80 days now. We've got to find our yacht – but where is it?</em></p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Phil &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong><em>Day 15 – we're in Sao Tome and trying to smuggle our new friend Sophia off the island and onto our boat. She wants to escape from her violent husband and return to her home in the UK. I'm <strong>always</strong> happy to help someone in distress and my reward for doing so is a bag of top quality cacao beans – something I have to collect as part of my challenge. But there's no time to hang around – I only have 65 days left to sail around the world, and I'm not sure if Passepartout wants an extra passenger…</em></p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>Phil, I don't <strong>often</strong> complain but I'm not sure if we've got room for another passenger. I mean, have we got enough food? Where will she sleep? And can she sail?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>Keep your voice down… we can't leave her here – she's very upset. Sssh, look, here she comes. Sophia, over here… get inside this crate and we'll smuggle you onto the yacht. And if anyone asks us what we're doing, we can say we're loading up with supplies for our journey. In you get. Come on Passepartout, you can carry it; I'll keep a look out.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>Thanks!</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>Well, we did it. We now have a stowaway and despite Passepartout's doubts, Sophia seems to know about sailing because, like us, she was sailing around the world. I think it'll be fun having an extra person on board. I just hope Passepartout agrees…</em></p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>Sophia – you need to let the sail out a bit more – loosen that rope…</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>No, I don't think so. Wait until we 'go about' and then I'll do it; otherwise the wind will take us in the wrong direction.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>Ha ha Passepartout! I think you've met your match. Anyway, what's our best route from here?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>We've got to go around the Cape of Good Hope. It's <strong>always</strong> a tricky bit of water. Plenty of ships have got caught in the strong currents and gone onto the rocks.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>If you allow me to steer, I can safely navigate us through these dangerous waters.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>I think that's a great idea – don't you Passepartout? I'll put the kettle on and make some tea.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>Day 22 – we've crossed the Equator and we're rounding the Cape of Good Hope. The sea is rough: the waves are like the huge hands of a monster trying to grab us. If we can get through this, we'll be out into the Indian Ocean and we will head for Indonesia. Sophia is doing a great job steering the yacht and Passepartout is busy looking after the ropes and sails. I'm downstairs in the galley writing this – I don't think I'm much help on deck you see. I'll see what our exact position is now on the satnav… oh, that's strange… the screen is blank… I can <strong>usually</strong> see where we are and our coordinates. What's wrong with it?</em></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>Passepartout, the navigation system isn't working.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>What? Let me have a look… Hmmm, very strange… everything else is working… let me just turn it on and… off again… that <strong>usually</strong> helps… No good.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>Is there a problem?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>We can't get the satnav to work – the screen is just blank. If we don't get it working again we're going to be lost at sea – we won't know where we're going.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>I'll take a look at the fuse box. Phil, you need to help up on deck and… woooah…</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>A huge wave has hit us. I'm ok, thankfully, but Passepartout has knocked his head badly. The satnav is broken and we're not sure what direction we're heading in. This is a bad, bad situation. If we go in the wrong direction we could lose days and we'll <strong>never</strong> win this race.</em></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>Phil! Phil! I need your help. Passepartout is in a bad condition - look, he's got a huge cut on his head – he's bleeding badly. I need your help to keep us on course through these huge waves.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>OK. But we need to find land soon and get Passepartout to a hospital. But which direction do we go?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>Well, the sun always sets in the west – so that way must be east. And when it gets dark we can follow the stars. &nbsp;You steer that way and I'll sort out the sails. And Phil…</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>… yes?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>You're doing really well.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>Oh… gosh, thanks.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>I'm beginning to like our new travelling companion. But I'm worried – we don't know where we're heading and Passepartout needs medical help. We've got to find land, but where? We're miles from anywhere. I'm beginning to wonder why I agreed to this stupid challenge.</em> <em>I've never missed home as much as now.</em></p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>Day 7 – we're in the Cape Verde islands and, no, we didn't sink! We have made it to port. There was a small hole in the tanks that store our drinking water and someone is now fixing it. But I'm glad we stopped here– <strong>the islands here are like another world</strong> – green, lush, warm and sunny – <strong>not like the concrete jungle we left at home</strong>. Unfortunately, we can't stay here for long – we are in a race after all, around the world. There's just time to take a 'selfie' to send back to my friends (click) – oh and I must just log on and check my emails…</em></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>So there's an email from John who says… he hopes our trip is going well… and to remind me, that as part of the challenge, I have to bring back some rare, unusual souvenirs – and he wants a recording of some traditional music. Hmmm, what could that be?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>Phil, everything is fixed. I've filled up with drinking water. It didn't cost much and the chap who fixed it gave me this CD – something for us to listen to on the yacht.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>What is it?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>I don't know. It's just a CD of the local <em>Morna</em> music.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil</strong><br /><strong>What does it sound like?</strong></p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>He said <strong>it's a bit like blues music</strong>. Have a listen.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil<br /></span></strong>That's brilliant Passepartout! What would I do without you?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>Day 10 – and I'm out in the Atlantic Ocean – and what a big ocean it is when you look at it from our small yacht, The Mermaid. It is miles and miles of blue and grey water with nothing to see on the horizon. But we've got a good tail wind and we seem to be making good progress. Passepartout is at the wheel, steering our yacht to our next destination – St Helena. I'm helping out by making tea…</em></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></span></strong>Cup of tea, Passepartout?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></span></strong>More tea! OK then, it will help me concentrate. The sea is getting quite rough and I need your help up here on deck…<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>RADIO MESSAGE:<br /></strong><em>Attention all shipping. A deep depression is forming in the South Atlantic, moving north. Severe gale force 11 winds are expected with heavy rain</em>. <em>Visibility will be poor.</em></p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>Strong wind. Heavy rain. Sounds nasty. We're going to have to change direction. Get your waterproof clothes on – we're in for a wet and bumpy ride…</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>The weather is already getting bad. The wind is very strong and the rain is hammering down and stinging our faces. Not my favourite weather – I prefer the calm, warm, sunny type. But we have no choice – we need to find shelter. Passepartout says we should go to some islands at 0.3 degrees north, 6.6 degrees east. Where could that be? And will we make it before the storm gets us? This was a dream trip – and suddenly <strong>it’s like a nightmare</strong></em></p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>Phil what are you doing? Hold onto that rope. Don't let go or we'll lose the sail.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></span></strong>OK. It's getting very dark. Do you know which way to go?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></span></strong>Yes – of course I do – we do have a satellite navigation system. According to this, we're not too far from the coast – but I can't see anything.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil</strong></p> 
 <p>Look! I can see lights of Sao Tome. Is that a lighthouse? Is it a harbour?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></span></strong>Yes. I think it is… but I don't know how we're going to land in these stormy seas. We're just going to hit the rocks.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></span></strong>Hey look! There's someone on the harbour wall waving their arms. Let's get closer… Is it a mermaid?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP<br /></span></strong>A mermaid? She has legs.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Sophia<br /></span></strong>Over here. Quick! Throw me the rope.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><em>Phew. What luck! We're on dry land, safe from the storm and it’s all thanks to the help of a woman who lives on the island. She's invited us to her house to dry off and warm up. &nbsp;But are we in the right place?</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Phil</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></span>Thanks so much for helping us – you saved our boat – and our lives.</p> 
 <p><strong>Sophia</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></span>My name is Sophia. I'm happy to have helped. Here you are – try some bobofrito and a cup of hot chocolate.</p> 
 <p><strong>PP</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></span>Mmm, nice. <strong>They taste like banana</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Sophia</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></span>That's what they are – bobofrito is banana fried in coconut oil. Do you like it?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></span></strong>Do I like it? It’s amazing… just… let… me get some more… Mmmm…</p> 
 <p><strong>Sophia</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></span>So tell me, what are you guys doing here?</p> 
 <p><strong>PP</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></span>We're sailing round the world but we needed to shelter from the storm. We were heading for St Helena… is that right, Phil?</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></span>What? Oh yes, that's right. Sorry, I was enjoying this delicious hot chocolate. It tastes great too.</p> 
 <p><strong>Sophia</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></span>It's made with our finest cacao beans. It's what Sao Tome and Principe is famous for.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></span>Cacao beans! That's great because they are one of the things I have to collect as part of my challenge. Can I take some with me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Sophia</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></span>Your challenge?</p> 
 <p><strong>PP</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></span>Yes, we're sailing around the world from London back to London in 80 days. It's a stupid idea, isn't it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Sophia</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></span>Hmm, well maybe not. Actually, you can have a bag of these beans if you can do me a favour?</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></span>I'm sure we can help you.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Phil &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong><em>Sophia has told me she was also sailing around the world when she stopped in Sao Tome for a rest and ended up falling in love with a man who she then married. &nbsp;But her husband has started being cruel to her and she wants to leave the island and go home.

"<p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>Hello again. It's Phil here. You may know that I've been set a challenge to sail around the world in 80 days – it's an impossible challenge especially as I have never sailed a yacht before. But I said 'yes' – so here it goes...</em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></span></strong>So, here we at Saint Catherine's Dock and look – here's my yacht <em>– The Mermaid</em> - I know she's a bit scruffy but I'm sure she'll get you round the world…</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></span></strong>Hmm, on my own! That's the bit that worries me. It's a very small boat.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></span></strong>It's a yacht – not a boat – look: it's got a sail! Anyway, you'll be fine. Just call me on the satellite phone if you have any problems.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></span></strong>Hello, hi. Phil. Phil! It's me.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></span></strong>Pete, what are you doing here?</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em><br /></strong><em>Pete is my office assistant: He makes the tea, he does the photocopying, he sometimes gives me ideas for my books. He's a great guy – so I'm really pleased to see him now…</em></p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></span></strong>Tom posted a message on Facebook that you're going on a trip round the world, or something. I couldn't believe my eyes – so I had to come here and see for myself. Look, I've brought you some books to read… and a map – you'll find that useful.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></span></strong>I will… but what I really need is a travelling companion… someone who can help me on my journey… someone like you?! How about it?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></span></strong>No. Absolutely not. I can't. I've got to… errr… feed the cat.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></span></strong>I'll feed your cat. Go on. Can't you see he needs your help!</p> 
 <p><strong>PP &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><br />I get<strong> seasick</strong>…</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></span></strong>Rubbish! I remember when you went sailing with your Dad – you were always fine.</p> 
 <p><strong>PP</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></span>That was different. We were sailing on a lake.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></span>Well, you know about sails and rope and anchors – you'd be great. Besides, if you come with me you can have a share of the money.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></span></strong>If you get home in 80 days!</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br /></strong><em>I'm pleased to report that Pete is joining me. I'm so pleased I have someone to 'show me the ropes', as it were – in other words, show me what to do. He's a good friend, a loyal assistant and he goes everywhere with me so I'm giving him the nickname 'Passepartout', just like in the original book, Around the World in Eighty Days – I hope he likes it!</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Phil&nbsp;<em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em><br /></strong><em>We've set sail. Our adventure has begun. Let me describe the yacht to you<strong>. </strong>It is 12 metres long. It has a huge mast, with the mainsail attached. There is an engine as well just in case there's no wind. The wooden deck has seating at the<strong> stern </strong>– that's the back.There are some steps down to the galley – that's the kitchen – and there are two <strong>berths</strong> or beds for us to sleep in. I can't believe we're going to live in this tiny space for 80 days!</em></p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></span></strong>Phil, we've got the wind in our sails, we're making good progress. I can't even see land any more.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></span></strong>Yes. Thanks to you, it's <strong>plain sailing</strong>! So, what does this rope do?</p> 
 <p><strong>PP &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br />It moves the<strong> jib</strong> – the sail at the front.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></span></strong>And this one?</p> 
 <p><strong>PP &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><br />That moves the boom from side to side. No, no. But don't pull it until…</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></span></strong>Ouch! That hurt.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil&nbsp;<em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em><br /></strong><em>Day 5 and I'm learning how to sail but my best skills are in the galley, making tea. The weather is good but we seem to have a problem with the yacht…</em></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></span></strong>Passepartout, is it me or is it getting a bit wet down in the <strong>galley</strong>?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></span></strong>Let me have a look. Oh dear! There's water all over the floor. I think the boat is leaking.</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></span></strong>What? What are we going to do?</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></span></strong>Drown!</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Phil &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></span></strong>What? Really? I'm going to get on the radio and call for help… Mayday! Mayday! Oh no. The radio isn't working. We're in big trouble!</p> 
 <p><strong><span>PP &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></span></strong>Be quiet. Calm down Phil. The radio isn't turned on – and we don't need to abandon ship just yet. I need to know where this water is coming from. It's only a slow leak but I think we need to fix it quickly. We need to head for dry land.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil&nbsp;<br /></strong><em>According to the map the nearest land is some islands at 16 degrees north, 24 degrees west. Do you know where that is? Let's hope we get there before we sink.</em></p>

"<p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>Hello, I'm Phil.&nbsp;I live in London. My apartment is close to the Houses of Parliament and I can hear the bells of Big Ben chiming every hour. I live on bus route number 88 which is handy because it takes me to my office in Oxford Circus. What do I do? Well, I'm an author –&nbsp;I write books&nbsp;– but don't worry if you haven't heard of me, my books never sell – ever. In fact&nbsp;I want a career change&nbsp;because I desperately need some money. When I pay all my bills, you see, I only have enough spare money to buy a few drinks at my local pub – The Horse and Groom. That reminds me – I've got to go there now to meet some friends. Excuse me, we'll speak again soon.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>AT THE PUB</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>John<br /></strong>Hello Phil. Late again!</p> 
 <p><strong>Emily<br /></strong>Hello Phil.&nbsp;How is your writing going?</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>You know. It's all in my head not on paper.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Hi Phil, mate, how are you? We were just talking about travelling – Emily here, says she's climbed up Mount Everest! Rather extreme <strong>backpacking</strong>, don't you think?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Emily<br /></strong>I did do it. Five years ago. So come on John,&nbsp;what amazing thing have you done?</p> 
 <p><strong>John<br /></strong>Oh, I just went cycling across South America!</p> 
 <p><strong>Emily<br /></strong>You didn't!!</p> 
 <p><strong>John<br /></strong>I did. In my <strong>gap year</strong>. It was such a brilliant time. Four months on the road, although I did get a bit tired.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Sounds great. Did I ever tell you that I sailed across the Atlantic to America in a yacht I built with my own hands? I still have that yacht down at the docks – but I never use it now. How about you Phil –&nbsp;when did you have your big life <strong>adventure</strong>?</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>Oh me? I haven't done much really. I'm not really one for adventure.</p> 
 <p><strong>Emily<br /></strong>Why not?</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>Err… I never had any money - and&nbsp;where would I go?</p> 
 <p><strong>John<br /></strong>Come on, you need some adventure in your life.&nbsp;Don't you feel like doing some <strong>globetrotting</strong>?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Hey! I've got an idea!</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>Tom has come up with a crazy idea where I could make some money and have some adventure. He has offered to lend me his yacht to sail around the world! Yeah – mad isn't it?! He thinks I could write about my adventures and make some money from it. But… I'm not someone who takes risks and I can definitely think of some problems…</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>Slight problem… I can't sail.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>No problem. There's an app you can download. It'll show you everything.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>An app? I'll need more than that. I've never sailed a yacht in my life.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>It's easy! And how about if I&nbsp;<em>give&nbsp;</em>you the boat – I'll never use it again - you can sell it when you get back. It'll earn you a fortune, on top of the money you get from your travel writing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>I couldn't possibly keep your yacht. You might want to use it again one day.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Hmmm yes, that's true.</p> 
 <p><strong>John<br /></strong>I&nbsp;know.&nbsp;Why don't you make it into a challenge?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yes, John! Great idea. I'll tell you what – I'll make you a bet.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>A&nbsp;bet – for money –&nbsp;what is it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Do you remember that story by Jules Verne&nbsp;– when that guy, Phileas Fogg had to travel around the world in 80 days?</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>Yes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Well, you've got to do it in 80 days. I bet you the boat that you won't do it. If you don't do it, I'll keep the boat.<em>&nbsp;If</em>&nbsp;you&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;sail around the world in 80 days, then you can keep the boat – and you can sell it if you want. He'll never do it!</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>Hold on.&nbsp;How much have you had to drink?&nbsp;You want me to sail around the world, on my own, in 80 days?! Impossible.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>I know. But if you want an adventure – and you want to keep the yacht – then that's the challenge. Exactly 80 days to sail all the way around the world – not a minute longer.</p> 
 <p><strong>Emily<br /></strong>Go on Phil, it'll be brilliant. Here, have another drink…</p> 
 <p><strong>John<br /></strong>Yes, and have my drink too.</p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong><em>What should I do?</em><em>&nbsp;It is true I need an adventure but this one is huge. I know, I'll have a few more drinks and think about it…</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Phil<br /></strong>OK. Yes - I accept the challenge!</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>A lot has happened to Ebenezer Scrooge. How will this story end? Scrooge's only love used to be money, but now he might be a changed man! After the struggle with the frightening Spirit of Christmas Yet To Come, he found himself in his own bed, in his own room, and he felt happy and ready to change his life.</p> 
 <p><strong>AT SCROOGE'S HOUSE</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>I'm as light as a bird, I'm as happy as an angel, I'm as merry as a schoolboy, I'm as giddy as a drunken man. A merry Christmas to everybody! A happy New Year to all the world. Hello!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Scrooge ran to the window and put out his head. Bells are ringing! Ah! The sun was shining, the air felt fresh. Everything was wonderful!</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Hey boy! Yes, you. Look up. Here in the window! What's today?</p> 
 <p><strong>Boy<br /></strong>It's Christmas Day, sir!</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>It's Christmas Day. I haven't missed it. The Spirits have done it all in one night. Hello, my good boy. Do you know whether they've sold the special turkey that was hanging up there?</p> 
 <p><strong>Boy<br /></strong>What? The one as big as me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Yes! Go and buy it, and tell them to bring it here, so I may give them the address to take it to. Come back with the man, and I'll give you a little money. Come back with him in less than five minutes and I'll give you a lot of money.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The boy ran off as fast as he could.</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>I'll send it to Bob Cratchit's. He will not know who sends it. It's twice the size of Tiny Tim!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Then Scrooge went to the streets. He was greeting everyone: &quot;Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!&quot; He approached the gentlemen who had asked him to help the poor. He had behaved so badly before, when he refused to give anything. But now, he offered them a generous donation.</p> 
 <p><strong>IN THE STREET</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Gentleman<br /></strong>My dear Mr Scrooge, are you serious?! I don't know what to say to such kindness!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>In the afternoon Scrooge went to his nephew's house for that dinner he was invited to but didn't want to go to. Do you remember that? How will his nephew react?</p> 
 <p><strong>AT SCROOGE'S NEPHEW'S HOUSE ENTRANCE</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge's Nephew<br /></strong>Who's that?! Uncle Scrooge! Welcome, uncle! Come and have some fun with us!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>His nephew received him with open arms. And what a party it was! It was great to be in that same party the Spirit of Christmas Present had shown him before. And this time everybody could see Scrooge and talk to him. The next morning, the old man went to the office very early to catch Bob Cratchit coming late. Eighteen and a half minutes late!</p> 
 <p><strong>AT SCROOGE'S OFFICE</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>What do you mean by coming here at this time of day?</p> 
 <p><strong>Bob Cratchit<br /></strong>I'm very sorry, sir. It's only once a year. It will not be repeated. I was making rather merry yesterday, you see, sir...</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Now, I'll tell you what, my friend: I am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer. And therefore… and therefore I'm about to raise your salary!</p> 
 <p><strong>Bob Cratchit<br /></strong>Mr Scrooge?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>A Merry Christmas, Bob, my good friend. I'll raise your salary, and help your hard-working family, and we'll discuss your problems this very afternoon, over a Christmas drink!</p> 
 <p><strong>Bob Cratchit<br /></strong>Wonderful, Mr Scrooge! Wonderful!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Scrooge did it all, and much, much more. He became a second father to Tiny Tim, who did not die, and a good friend to all. Some people laughed to see how he'd changed, but he let them laugh. His own heart laughed: and that was quite enough for him. It was always said of Scrooge, that he knew how to keep the Christmas cheer alive and well. I hope we do the same. Tiny Tim has the last word:</p> 
 <p><strong>Tiny Tim<br /></strong>God bless us, everyone!</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Let's continue the story of Ebenezer Scrooge. The Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come couldn't have been more different from the Spirit of Christmas Present Scrooge had just seen disappearing. It was very tall and it was hidden in a black cape and hood. It didn't speak at all. Scrooge was getting used to the company of ghosts by now but he was afraid of this one.</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Ghost of the Future, I am more afraid of you than any spirit I've seen. But I know your purpose is to do me good. And I hope to become another man from the one I was, so I am prepared to be in your company. And do it with a thankful heart.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Was Scrooge really changing his ways? They went to the financial district and the Spirit stopped near a group of businessmen who were chatting.</p> 
 <p><strong>Businessman 1<br /></strong>I don't know much about it. I only know he's dead. It's likely to be a very cheap funeral! I'm certain I don't know of anybody who'll go to it. Should we volunteer?</p> 
 <p><strong>Businessman 2<br /></strong>I don't mind going if a lunch is provided! What happened to the money?</p> 
 <p><strong>Businessman 1<br /></strong>Well, he didn't give it to me!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Scrooge knew these men. But why did the Spirit make him listen to this conversation? No answer. Then the Spirit took him to a bad part of town. Criminals lived there. Some people were trying to sell stolen goods and they were making fun of the person who used to own them.</p> 
 <p><strong>Housekeeper<br /></strong>Who's the worse for the loss of a few things like these? Not a dead man, I suppose. He frightened everyone away from him when he was alive, but he profits us now he's dead!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And even the shirt the dead man was wearing was sold. A housekeeper, a laundress, an undertaker - they stood in line to make a profit on the dead man's things. Scrooge was shocked! He asked the Ghost to show him people with kindness towards the dead. And where do you think they went? Scrooge found himself back at Bob Cratchit's house. But this time everybody was sad and quiet. Bob Cratchit had just returned from church where he had made arrangements for somebody's funeral.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mrs Cratchit<br /></strong>How was it, Robert?</p> 
 <p><strong>Bob Cratchit<br /></strong>I wish you could have been there, dear wife. It would have done you good to see how green a place it is. But you'll see it often. I promised him that I would walk there on a Sunday. My little, little child...</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Scrooge knew now that Tiny Tim was dead. But who was that man whose death others were talking about? The Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come took Scrooge to a graveyard and pointed ahead. On the stone of a neglected grave, the old man read a name: Ebenezer Scrooge! It was his own name! It was Scrooge's grave!</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>No, Spirit. Oh no, no! Spirit, hear me. I'm not the man I was. Why show me this, if all hope is gone?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Wow! That's a brand new Scrooge we're seeing! And he's not done yet in his pleading...</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Good Spirit, tell me that I still may change these shadows you have shown me, by changing my life. I will celebrate Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I'll live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The Spirits of all Three shall live within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach. Oh, tell me that I may remove the writing on this stone!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Scrooge grabbed the Spirit's hand. The Spirit tried to free itself. In the end, it just disappeared. Scrooge found himself grabbing his own bedpost. What will happen now? I'll tell you next time.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Ebenezer Scrooge woke up just before the clock struck one again. He was ready for the Spirit of Christmas Present. This time, he met his guide in the next room, which looked very different from usual. It was decorated with holly and other plants. On the table, there was a lot of delicious Christmas food like turkey, cake, fruit... Scrooge talked to the ghost.</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Spirit, take me where you like. Last night I learnt a lesson. Tonight, if you want to teach me, let me profit by it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Oh, that's not the Scrooge we knew before. No longer arrogant?! Well, the Spirit took Scrooge to the edge of the city where his clerk Bob Cratchit lived. The man entered his humble home carrying a little boy who had a crutch and iron around his legs. His wife was preparing the meal.</p> 
 <p><strong>AT BOB CRATCHIT'S HOUSE</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Mrs Cratchit<br /></strong>How did Tiny Tim behave at church, Robert?</p> 
 <p><strong>Bob Cratchit<br /></strong>As good as gold! He told me on our way home that he hoped that people noticed him in the church, because he's disabled. It might be good for them to remember on Christmas Day our Lord, who made lame people walk and blind men see.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Tiny Tim was a sweet little boy who knew the meaning of Christmas. But he was very sick. Scrooge felt sorry for him and asked the Spirit what was going to happen.</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Spirit, tell me if Tiny Tim will live.</p> 
 <p><strong>Spirit of Christmas Present<br /></strong>I see an empty seat in the corner, and a crutch without an owner. If things don't change in the future, the child will die.</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>No, no. Oh, no, kind Spirit. Say he'll live!</p> 
 <p><strong>Spirit of Christmas Present<br /></strong>If he's going to die, he should do it, and&nbsp;<em>decrease the surplus population.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>These words caused a huge and sudden feeling of deep regret in Scrooge's heart. That was exactly what he had said earlier to the gentlemen who had asked for a donation to help the poor. If the poor died&nbsp;<em>it would be good to help decrease the surplus population</em>. Then, Scrooge heard Cratchit mention his name...</p> 
 <p><strong>Bob Cratchit<br /></strong>After this wonderful dinner, let's raise our glasses. A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears! God bless us! And also Mr Scrooge, the Father of the Feast! Come on, dear wife!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mrs Cratchit<br /></strong>I wish I had him here, Robert. I'd give him a piece of my mind! Such a horrible, hard, unfeeling man, Mr Scrooge. I'll drink to his health because it is Christmas, but not because of him.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tiny Tim<br /></strong>God bless us every one!</p> 
 <p><strong>Bob Cratchit<br /></strong>Thank you, Tim, my dear child.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>There was no doubt Scrooge was the monster of the family. But if the thought of her husband's selfish boss annoyed Mrs Cratchit, it caused laughter elsewhere. The Ghost of Christmas Present took Scrooge to his nephew's house - to the Christmas dinner the old man had refused to go to.</p> 
 <p><strong>AT SCROOGE'S NEPHEW'S HOUSE</strong>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge's Nephew<br /></strong>...and my uncle said that Christmas was a humbug! He's a funny man, that's the truth. And not as pleasant as he could be. However, his crimes carry their own price. His money is of no use to him. He doesn't do any good with it. He doesn't make himself comfortable with it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The house was full of people dancing, playing games. The Spirit noticed that Scrooge was enjoying himself. The night was coming to an end when Scrooge saw two figures at the ghost's feet. What were they? They looked like children, but they were old and frightening. Scrooge was shocked.</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>I'm sorry to ask but... are they yours?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Spirit of Christmas Present<br /></strong>They are Man's creatures. The boy is Ignorance. The girl is Want. Be afraid of them both, but most of all you should fear this boy for on his face I see a terrible destiny!</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Don't they have a place to go?</p> 
 <p><strong>Spirit of Christmas Present<br /></strong><em>Are there no prisons? Are there no workhouses?</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Yes, once more Scrooge had his own words repeated back to him. He had always thought the poor&nbsp;<em>had prisons and workhouses to go to</em>, hadn't he? Eat your words, Mr Scrooge! Well, the bell struck twelve and that was it for the Ghost of Christmas Present. He disappeared. But the third spirit was coming. You'll hear about it next time.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Let's continue the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, the selfish man who didn't like Christmas. Last time, the ghost of his dead partner, Marley, told Scrooge he would be visited by three spirits. They would give him a chance of escaping Marley's fate. Scrooge was in bed when the curtains were opened and he saw a face...</p> 
 <p><strong>Spirit of Christmas Past<br /></strong>I'm the Ghost of Christmas Past - your past. Come with me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The Spirit took Scrooge through a wall and suddenly they found themselves on an open country road. The city had disappeared. Scrooge was very excited.</p> 
 <p><strong>IN SCROOGE'S OLD NEIGHBOURHOOD</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Good heavens! I grew up in this place. That's the river! And... Oh, and I used to climb that tree…</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>He remembered everybody's names. He could see them, but they couldn't see him or the Spirit. Then the Spirit invited Scrooge to go to the local school.</p> 
 <p><strong>Spirit of Christmas Past<br /></strong>The school is not quite empty. There's still a child there...</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>I know! And I know who it is!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>There he was, young Scrooge, alone in a room, sad and lonely. But one Christmas, his young sister came to the school with good news.</p> 
 <p><strong>AT SCROOGE'S OLD SCHOOL</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge's little sister<br /></strong>Hello, my dear brother! I've come to take you home! Home forever and ever. Father is much kinder than he used to be and he sent me in a carriage to bring you. And we'll be together all Christmas, and have the merriest time in all the world!</p> 
 <p><strong>Spirit of Christmas Past<br /></strong>Your sister... She had a big heart! She died when she was an adult and had, I think, children. Your nephew!</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Yes. She was so kind...</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Do I sense regret in Scrooge's voice? He behaved so badly towards his nephew... But time was running out and the Spirit of Christmas Past had another place to take Scrooge to: a big warehouse.</p> 
 <p><strong>AT SCROOGE'S OLD WORKPLACE</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Spirit of Christmas Past<br /></strong>So, do you recognise this place?</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Yes! I was an apprentice here. Oh! Old Mr Fezziwig! That's my old boss!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Fezziwig<br /></strong>Yo ho ho boys, no more work tonight. It's Christmas Eve! Clear away my lads, and let's have lots of room here!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The warehouse was transformed into a bright ballroom in no time at all. In came a musician, Mrs Fezziwig and her three daughters, and all the young men and women employed in the business. It got old Scrooge thinking. He told the Spirit...</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Mr Fezziwig had the power to make us happy or unhappy; to make our work easy or hard; pleasure or pain. The happiness he gave us is as great as if it had cost a huge pile of gold. I should like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk Bob Cratchit just now<strong>.</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Is there a change in old Scrooge? Mmmm... Maybe... Well, the mood was darker when the Spirit took Scrooge to see another Christmas a few years later. Then, the young Scrooge was starting to look obsessed with money. He wasn't alone. There was a young woman by his side. Oh, she was crying...</p> 
 <p><strong>IN THE PAST</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge's girlfriend<br /></strong>Something else has taken my place; if it can cheer and comfort you as I wanted to do, I have no reason to cry. May you be happy in the life you have chosen!</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Spirit, show me no more. Take me home. Why do you torture me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>It was hard for Scrooge to see how his girlfriend left him when he started to fall in love with money. But the Spirit's work wasn't done yet. He took Scrooge to yet another Christmas a few years from then. And the greedy, old man saw her happy with a husband and children - children who he almost wished were his own. Scrooge was very depressed when he got back home: the kind sister whose son he rejected, the generous employer, the lost girlfriend – that's a lot to take in! But there were still two spirits left. What would the Spirit of Christmas Present show Scrooge? Let's see it tomorrow. I can't wait!</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>This is the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, a man who loved money and didn't like Christmas. There he was, on Christmas Eve, in his office. He was keeping an eye on his clerk Bob Cratchit. Scrooge wanted to get every little bit of work from Cratchit before allowing him to spend Christmas Day at home. Scrooge thought Christmas was a waste of time! Even his nephew couldn't convince him that it wasn't.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>IN SCROOGE'S OFFICE</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge's Nephew<br /></strong>A Merry Christmas, uncle!</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Bah! Humbug!</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge's Nephew<br /></strong>You don't mean that, I'm sure!</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>What's Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money? You find yourself a year older, but not an hour richer! What good has it ever done you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge's Nephew<br /></strong>I've always thought of Christmas as a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time. A time when men and women seem to open their hearts freely. It's never put money in my pocket, but I believe that it's done me good!</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Humbug!</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge's Nephew<br /></strong>Come on, uncle, come and have dinner with us tomorrow.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Scrooge's nephew was persistent but the old man wouldn't change his mind. He was in his usual bad mood when two gentlemen came to his office to ask for a donation to offer Christmas dinner to the poor. Scrooge worked in the money-lending business. No donation from him...</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Gentlemen, are there no prisons and workhouses, where the poor receive food and accommodation in return for some work?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gentleman<br /></strong>We wish we could say there aren't any, Mr Scrooge. Many poor people would rather die than go to prison or the...</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>They should die and decrease the surplus population. And... well, it's none of my business anyway. They cost a lot of money, and the poor should go there. Goodbye, sir.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Typical Scrooge! He feels sorry for no-one, helps no-one. With him, it's all about money. He thought of nothing else. His partner, Jacob Marley, had died seven years before, at Christmas. Marley was like Scrooge when he was alive. But now he was gone. Or was he?</p> 
 <p><strong>AT SCROOGE'S HOUSE</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Who's there? I'm finally home and I want some peace!</p> 
 <p><strong>Marley<br /></strong>Scroooge... Scrooooooge...</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>What is this? A ghost?! It's not possible! I must be having indigestion and seeing things that aren't there!</p> 
 <p><strong>Marley<br /></strong>Scrooge. In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Marley, is it really you?! And what is this strange metal chain you are wearing? It's made of cash-boxes, keys, locks, heavy purses...</p> 
 <p><strong>Marley<br /></strong>I wear the chain I made in life. Of my own free will I wore it when I was alive. Is its pattern strange to you? Or do you wish to know the weight and length of the heavy chain you are carrying yourself?<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Don't say that, Jacob. And why is this happening to you? You were always a good man of business…</p> 
 <p><strong>Marley<br /></strong>Business!? Mankind was my business. Charity, kindness - were all my business. Why did I walk through crowds of people with my eyes turned down? I'm here to warn you, that you still have a chance of escaping my fate. You'll be visited by three spirits. Expect the first spirit tomorrow at one o'clock in the morning. And remember what I've told you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Marley disappeared into the night, flying out of an open window with other ghosts which looked as miserable as him. Scrooge was shocked. I'll tell you about the visit of the first spirit next time.</p>

"<p><strong>Scene 1 – A cat and his man</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>NARRATOR<br /></strong>We present: The story of Dick Whittington and his cat, a pantomime.&nbsp;Featuring the cats and cast of BBC Learning English. Let's start off by meeting our hero, Dick Whittington. He's just walking home after a long day at the office… Hey there Dick.</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Hello!</p> 
 <p><strong>NARRATOR<br /></strong>Tell us a bit about yourself. Where you're from, hobbies and so on…</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Well… I'm a young man – not from London, originally – I came here last year looking for my <strong>fortune</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>NARRATOR<br /></strong>Any luck so far?</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Well, I've got a good job. I'm Assistant Paperclips Officer for a very large company. It's my responsibility to make sure we never, ever run out of paperclips.</p> 
 <p><strong>NARRATOR<br /></strong>That sounds… really not a very good job…</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>No, it isn't that good. But, you've got to start somewhere, haven't you? And tomorrow, things might just change for the better.</p> 
 <p><strong>NARRATOR<br /></strong>Why, what's happening tomorrow?</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>It's the 134th London Rat-Catching Contest! The winner gets to be… Lord Mayor of London. I've always wanted to be the Lord Mayor of London. It just… sounds so cool. 'Hi, I'm Dick – Lord Mayor of London'.</p> 
 <p><strong>NARRATOR<br /></strong>But… Are you much good at catching rats?</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>No, But I've got a cat – Apple. He'll catch the rats for me.</p> 
 <p><strong>NARRATOR<br /></strong>Apple's rather an odd name for a cat, isn't it?</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Well… I don't think so, no. Anyway, you'll meet Apple in just a minute.&nbsp;Hi Apple, I'm home!</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Where've you been? I was expecting you home an hour ago.</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Sorry,&nbsp;<strong>old thing</strong>. I got <strong>held up </strong>at the office.</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Oh right. Another paperclip 'emergency' I suppose.</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Yes… something like that.</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Oh right… and how are your fingers?</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>They're… ok. A bit paperclippy, but… Why do you ask?</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>They haven't fallen off then?</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>No… Of course not, what are you talking about?!</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Well if your fingers haven't fallen off… why can't you phone and tell me you're going to be late?!</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Oh please, please can we just have one night without an argument?!&nbsp;I'm tired, I've had a long day…</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>All right, all right <strong>keep your fur on</strong>. Your dinner's in the oven.</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Thank you… Oh, rat <strong>ragout </strong>again! Do we really have to eat the same thing every day!?</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>It's good for you – all the main <strong>food groups </strong>are present on that plate. And I've picked out the tails…</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Well that's something I suppose. Hey, speaking of rats, what are you doing tomorrow?</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Tomorrow – what time?</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>About three o'clock.</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Three o'clock… let's see… I'm sleeping.</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Well, how about, instead of sleeping, you take part in the 134th London Rat-Catching Contest?</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Ha! You're <strong>having a laugh ain't cha</strong>? No way!</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Why not?</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>All that heartless, pointless killing …the screams of the little animals as they die… the blood that never comes off your paws… the horror, the horror…</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>But we eat rat every day!</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Yeah, frozen rat from the supermarket. If you want to kill something furry, get a professional!</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>I'll buy you a tuna steak…</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>What's that you say? A tuna steak? Well… it wouldn't be that bad to be the Lord Mayor of London's cat….</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>You could eat tuna every day…</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Including weekends?</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Of course. Are you going to help me, Apple?</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Well, I'll give it a go.</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Yey!</p> 
 <p><strong>Scene 2 – The 134th London Rat-Catching Contest</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>NARRATOR<br /></strong>So, here we are at the 134th London Rat-Catching&nbsp;Contest, the most important and exciting event in the whole rat-catching <strong>calendar</strong>. What a glorious, sunny day it is for this important competition. And there are literally thousands of cats and their owners here in Trafalgar Square… over there is Dick Whittington looking slightly <strong>agitated </strong>– we all know how much that young man wants to be Lord Mayor of London. And standing nearby – no! surely not – well, yes, it's that rich and successful banker, Franky Banky. What's he doing here?</p> 
 <p><strong>FRANKY BANKY<br /></strong>Yeah, yeah it doesn’t matter if I don't win. I mean the Lord Mayor thing would just be <strong>another string to my bow</strong>. I'm in hedge funds, private equity, that kind of thing. Basically, I'm incredibly rich and successful. Would you believe I made 60 grand yesterday just on paperclips?</p> 
 <p><strong>ADMIRERS<br /></strong>No, really? Wow. That's amazing.</p> 
 <p><strong>FRANKY<br /></strong>Actually, there's a man who knows a thing or two about paperclips. Dick Whittington, what are you doing here?</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Oh, hi Franky.</p> 
 <p><strong>FRANKY<br /></strong>I was just telling these good people how <strong>I made a killing on paperclips </strong>yesterday and today I'm going to make another killing to become Lord Mayor of London.</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Oh right.</p> 
 <p><strong>FRANKY<br /></strong>Right! And, let me give you a free piece of advice. Don't waste your time, Dick. Go home now. Your little 'pet' doesn't stand a chance against my Tigger…</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Tigger? Is that the name of your cat? That’s very original, Franky.</p> 
 <p><strong>FRANKY<br /></strong>Well it's a lot better than Apple! What kind of a name is that for a cat?! Tigger! <strong>Where’s he got to</strong>, we're going to be starting <strong>any</strong> <strong>minute</strong>. Tigger! Tigger! <em><br /></em></p> 
 <p><strong>TIGGER<br /></strong>Meow, mey meame is… meow… Tigger… and mi'm going to …meow… kill meall the mice and mats and mey measter's going to mecome Lord Meayer …of… Meondon.</p> 
 <p><strong>ADMIRING CATS<br /></strong>Meow, meally? Meow.</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>You know Tigger, you don't have to <strong>put up with </strong>that accent.</p> 
 <p><strong>TIGGER<br /></strong>Mehuh?</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Your accent… <em>'</em>mey meame is Tigger'. There's lots you can do to improve your pronunciation…</p> 
 <p><strong>TIGGER<br /></strong>Meow!</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>The most important thing is that you practise every day. Listen carefully to the way humans speak, and then repeat after them. Actually, I can recommend you a really good website for improving your English, it's called… have you got a pen? right… it's called…</p> 
 <p><strong>SYLVANIA FULBRIGHT<br /></strong>Er…Testing Testing. Is this thing working?</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>It’s called BBC Learning English dot com. It's a brilliant resource for every aspect of your English studies – grammar, vocabulary, listening-</p> 
 <p><strong>FULBRIGHT<br /></strong>Oh… sorry about that. My name is Sylvania Fulbright. Welcome to the 134th London Rat-Catching Contest. I can see quite a few familiar faces out there… and some new ones too…</p> 
 <p><strong>FRANKY<br /></strong>Get on with it!</p> 
 <p><strong>FULBRIGHT<br /></strong>Yes, so…These are the rules…Owners are not allowed to help their cats catch the mice in any way. Cats are only allowed to use one life during the contest and are not permitted to take <strong>stripe-enhancing</strong> <strong>drugs</strong>. All cats have until four o'clock to catch as many rats as they can. The owner with the most will be made… Lord Mayor of London!</p> 
 <p><strong>ALL<br /></strong>Oooh. Meow.</p> 
 <p><strong>TIGGER<br /></strong>Meow! See you at four o’clock, <strong>kitty-cat</strong>!</p> 
 <p><strong>FULBRIGHT<br /></strong>I now officially declare this contest… OPEN!</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Umpf! Ow! Oh watch it, that was my tail! I'm walking here!</p> 
 <p><strong>NARRATOR<br /></strong>And they're off to a flying start, with a great crowd of cats running up the Strand. Just listen to them go! Did you hear them? Taking the lead we have Franky Banky's cat, Tigger, a fine three-year-old <strong>tabby </strong>and I believe today is Tigger's <strong>debut </strong>on the professional circuit… so definitely one to watch. But another young cat that's debuting today is of course Apple… but at the moment… Apple is actually towards… the rear of the group, and… oh!… he's just slipped down that <strong>drain</strong>… I wonder what he'll find there…</p> 
 <p><strong>Scene 3 – Going Underground</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Thank crikey for that… I very nearly became a luxury <strong>doormat </strong>for <strong>the likes of </strong>Franky Banky. It's a bit dark down here though… time to use the <strong>old </strong>night vision… Oh, I'm in a sewer, how delightful. I wonder… is there a warm little corner where I can curl up for ten minutes? All work and no sleep makes Apple a very very…tired cat…. <strong>This’ll do</strong>…</p> 
 <p><strong>RAT 1<br /></strong>Ow!</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>What's that?</p> 
 <p><strong>RAT 1<br /></strong>I said 'Ow'. You just sat on me – get off you great big furball!</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Oh hello! You're a rat.</p> 
 <p><strong>RAT 1<br /></strong>Really? Is that right? I haven't checked the mirror today.</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Oh, <strong>sarcasm</strong>. You rats are always sarcastic. By rights I ought to catch you right now and take you back to my owner.</p> 
 <p><strong>RAT 1<br /></strong>You could never catch me.</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>No but I could probably catch something off you – get away with all your… horrible diseases!</p> 
 <p><strong>RAT 1<br /></strong>You go away! You're in <em>my </em>home!</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>This?! You call this home? It stinks! And how can you stand that dripping? Hang on… there we go.</p> 
 <p><strong>RAT 1<br /></strong>Oh! How'd you do that?</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>You must have left the tap on.</p> 
 <p><strong>RAT 1<br /></strong>Well, that's very … er… decent of you Mr Cat.</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Apple. My name's Apple.</p> 
 <p><strong>RAT 1<br /></strong>Apple? That's a strange name for a cat.</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Yeah, I'm not too pleased about it but what can I do? What's your name?</p> 
 <p><strong>RAT 1<br /></strong>Oh… you can just call me Rat 1. Er, let me introduce my family. This is my wife, Rat 2.</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Pleased to meet you.</p> 
 <p><strong>RAT 2<br /></strong>Pleased to meet you Apple. I've been telling him about that dripping for weeks.</p> 
 <p><strong>RAT 1<br /></strong>And this is my cousin, Rat 3.</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Hey Rat 3…</p> 
 <p><strong>RAT 3<br /></strong>What's happening, Apple?</p> 
 <p><strong>RAT 1<br /></strong>And this is my little sister, Rat 4</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Rat 4, Rat 4!… <strong><em>Encantada</em></strong><em>.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>RAT 4<br /></strong>Pleased to meet you!</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>You er… you all look and sound quite similar don't you?</p> 
 <p><strong>RAT 3<br /></strong>Yes, there is <strong>a strong family likeness </strong>but it’s easy to <strong>tell us apart</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Oh right, how do I do that?</p> 
 <p><strong>RAT 1<br /></strong>Just download the script. But you haven't met the kids yet. Here they are, Rats 5 to 30.</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Oh… hello.</p> 
 <p><strong>MANY RATS<br /></strong>Hello!</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Listen, you guys had better go and hide somewhere. Today's the day of the London Rat-Catching Contest. There are a lot of mean cats about who would just love to meet your family, if you know what I mean.</p> 
 <p><strong>MANY RATS<br /></strong>HE'S BEHIND YOU!</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Who? Who's behind me?</p> 
 <p><strong>RAT 1<br /></strong>Quick, everyone! Run away!</p> 
 <p><strong>FRANKY<br /></strong>Ha ha! Too late for you, my little rats!</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Franky Banky!!!</p> 
 <p><strong>FRANKY<br /></strong>That's right, it is I, Franky Banky and you can all <strong>boo </strong>if you like, I don't care, that's how bad I am! Thank you Apple, for introducing me to this cosy little rat family. Get them Tigger!</p> 
 <p><strong>TIGGER<br /></strong>Meow!</p> 
 <p><strong>RAT 1<br /></strong>Run everybody, run!</p> 
 <p><strong>FRANKY<br /></strong>Ha ha ha ha. They won't get far! And neither will you, Apple. How about the two of us go for a little walk?</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Well, thanks for the offer, but I'd rather not. I was just settling down for a nap, you see.</p> 
 <p><strong>FRANKY<br /></strong>Oh Apple.&nbsp;Apple, Apple, Apple. I really think it's time you came with me…</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>No, it's DEFINITELY time for a nap. <strong>It's gone two o'clock</strong>!</p> 
 <p><strong>FRANKY<br /></strong>Apple, I'm telling you to come with me. Don’t you know that very, very bad people like me&nbsp;are always polite? In fact, the more politely we speak, the badder we are. Understand!?</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>No no no no, you can't say 'badder', my friend. You mean 'worse'. Hey! Ow! Where are you taking me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Scene 4 – Zappo the Wonder Horse</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>NARRATOR<br /></strong>And so, the sweet and loyal Apple is being <strong>catnapped </strong>by that evil villain Franky Banky. What are you going to do about it Dick?</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Oh er… I've no idea really… Call the police?</p> 
 <p><strong>NARRATOR<br /></strong>Why not call, Zappo the Wonder Horse?!</p>

 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Hello. That was quick! Oh! There are two of you!</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. TOP<br /></strong>Yes… I'm the Top, you see.</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. BOTTOM<br /></strong>And I'm… lower down.</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. TOP<br /></strong>Now, young man – what seems to be the problem?</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Well… I'm looking for my cat, Apple.</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. TOP<br /></strong>Looking for your cat's apple?</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>No, I'm looking for my cat, whose name is Apple. He's competing in the Rat-Catching Contest, but he's just been taken… by Franky Banky.</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. BOTTOM<br /></strong>Franky Banky, you say?</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Yes, the narrator tells me he's got him right now. But I've no idea where he's taking him.</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. TOP<br /></strong>No, but wherever it is, we can tell you one thing.</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>What's that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. TOP<br /></strong>It won't be very nice!</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>No… so… do you think that you might be able to help me…?</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. BOTTOM<br /></strong>Unfortunately not – we're very sorry.</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. TOP<br /></strong>Bottom – what are you talking about - ?</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. BOTTOM<br /></strong>You see, Top half and I have agreed to stop fighting crime – and this definitely looks like a crime. Sorry… It's just far too dangerous. We can recommend the police though – they're awfully good.</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. TOP<br /></strong>Well, Bottom, we could maybe <strong>make an exception</strong>, on this one last occasion. After all, Franky Banky doesn't scare, Zappo the Wonder horse!</p> 
 <p><strong>BIG VOICE<br /></strong>ZAPPO THE WON-DER HOR-SE!!!</p> 
 <p><strong>LITTLE VOICE<br /></strong>Call 07700 900009. <strong>Special rates apply</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. BOTTOM<br /></strong>Yeah, but the trouble is… that if we make an exception for this guy then before long we'll be <strong>running around after </strong>every pantomime villain <strong>on the block</strong>. I'm sorry Top. If you want to go and look for this cat, fine, I'm going home.</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. TOP:<br /></strong>Unngh! Wait! I command you to stay!</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. BOTTOM<br /></strong>Ow, let me go! You can't tell me what to do!</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. TOP<br /></strong>Ungh… We've got to find Apple…</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Look guys, it really doesn’t matter. I'll just look for the cat myself!</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. TOP<br /></strong>Wait – don't go! Don’t… go Great. Well done Bottom, nice work. That poor man has lost not only his darling cat – but also his dream of becoming Lord Mayor of&nbsp;London!</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. BOTTOM<br /></strong>Well, you know, that's really sad and everything, but it's not really our problem is it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. TOP<br /></strong>It will be everyone’s problem if Franky Banky becomes Mayor!</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. BOTTOM<br /></strong>Oh. You might be right there.</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. TOP<br /></strong>Come on Botto! If anyone can stop that from happening surely it's -</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. BOTTOM<br /></strong>No – don’t say it again, please.</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. TOP<br /></strong>Surely it's… Zappo the Wonder horse!</p>

 <p><strong>Scene 5 – The Shed of Nightmares</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>NARRATOR<br /></strong>Meanwhile, in another part of the city, Franky Banky and Apple have reached their terrible destination…</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>So you see, there are rules for making comparatives, but there are one or two exceptions that you have to learn – and 'worse' is one of them.</p> 
 <p><strong>FRANKY<br /></strong>Shut up Apple, who cares about grammar?! Didn't you hear the narrator – we've reached our 'terrible destination'!</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Well… it doesn't look that terrible. This is just a garden <strong>shed</strong>, Franky.</p> 
 <p><strong>FRANKY<br /></strong>Right Apple. It looks just like any normal garden shed, but... in fact... it is… the SHED OF NIGHTMARES.</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>What's that then?</p> 
 <p><strong>FRANKY<br /></strong>The SHED OF NIGHTMARES… is an <strong>FX </strong>cupboard, which has been specially loaded with the nastiest horribilest sound effects ever! Enjoy this creaky door, Apple. It's the last nice effect you're going to hear for a very, very long time!</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Oh here we go.</p> 
 <p><strong>FRANKY<br /></strong>Have fun!</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Hmm. For an FX cupboard it’s awfully quiet in here…. Well, let's have a look around… what’s over here…? Ahhh! <strong>Easy boy</strong>, easy. Let's go over here… No, no, not the dentist! Stay calm Apple, stay calm, it's just an effect, not a real drill. Let's go over here… Oh no, oh no. The car's not starting! I'm gonna be late for an interview! Help me someone, help me! Dick! Dick where are you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Scene 6 – Looking for Apple</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>NARRATOR<br /></strong>But unfortunately Dick is on the other side of the city and definitely can't hear Apple. After giving up with Zappo the Wonder Horse -</p> 
 <p><strong>BIG VOICE<br /></strong>ZAPPO THE WON-DER HOR-SE!</p> 
 <p><strong>NARRATOR<br /></strong>Yes, yes, yes, thank you. After giving up with – after giving up with the pantomime horse, he has decided to search for the cat himself.</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Apple! Apple!</p> 
 <p><strong>SNOW WHITE<br /></strong>Grumpy! Sneezy! Bashful!</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Apple! Oh hello.</p> 
 <p><strong>SNOW<br /></strong>Hello.</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Sorry, I was just looking for my cat. And he's called Apple. I'm not, you know, one of those people who just walk around calling out the names of different fruit.</p> 
 <p><strong>SNOW<br /></strong>No, of course not! But, you haven't seen seven very small people on your travels, have you?</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Erm… children, you mean?</p> 
 <p><strong>SNOW<br /></strong>That sort of height, but with pickaxes. And facial hair.</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Oh, you mean dwarfs!</p> 
 <p><strong>SNOW<br /></strong>Yes, only I'm not sure that’s still <strong>a politically correct term</strong>, but yes, dwarfs.</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>No, I haven't. Are they friends of yours?</p> 
 <p><strong>SNOW<br /></strong>Very good friends of mine. We're in this pantomime together called Snow White – I'm Snow White by the way – and I was supposed to be meeting them at three but -</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Let me just stop you there. You're in the wrong pantomime, I'm afraid. This is Dick Whittington. In fact, I'm Dick.</p> 
 <p><strong>SNOW<br /></strong>Oh! You're kidding!</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>No, I'm afraid I'm not. Unless… I've accidentally wandered into Snow White … Either way, this is all <strong>a complete shambles</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>NARRATOR<br /></strong>Oh no it's not!</p> 
 <p><strong>BOTH<br /></strong>Oh yes it is!</p> 
 <p><strong>NARRATOR<br /></strong>Oh no it's not!</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>OK, OK, maybe it is, maybe it isn't. Listen – you would know this – is 'dwarfs' D-W-A-R-V-E-S or is it D-W-A-R-F-S?</p> 
 <p><strong>SNOW<br /></strong>Ah well, it's either – you can spell it either way.</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Oh really, I'd always wondered about that.</p> 
 <p><strong>SNOW<br /></strong>Yeah, I tell you what, there's a really good website where you'll find answers to all of your English language questions.</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Oh right, what's that then?</p> 
 <p><strong>SNOW<br /></strong>It's BBC Learning English dot com.</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>BBC… Learning English dot com. Tell me more.</p> 
 <p><strong>SNOW<br /></strong>Well, they've got a section called 'Ask about English' which deals with all those <strong>niggling </strong>questions about the English language…</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Right, OK, but I think what I really need to improve is my listening comprehension…</p> 
 <p><strong>SNOW<br /></strong>Then you’ll love 'Talk about English' – the BBC's weekly talk programme aimed <strong>specifically </strong>at English language learners. With downloadable scripts and language support pages, it's exposure to English in context!</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Right, so that's BBC Learning English dot com….</p> 
 <p><strong>SNOW<br /></strong>… for all your English language needs.</p> 
 <p><strong>NARRATOR<br /></strong>Have you two finished?</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Yeah… I'm not sure <strong>what came over me </strong>then…</p> 
 <p><strong>SNOW<br /></strong>Hmm… weird.</p> 
 <p><strong>Scene 7 – Ambush</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>NARRATOR<br /></strong>Well if you remember we left Franky Banky's cat Tigger in a sewer, chasing Rats 1 to 30, inclusive. Haven't you caught them yet, Tigger?</p>

 <p><strong>RAT 1<br /></strong>No, don't worry about him, Rat 2, he'll never find us here. He's far too stupid!</p> 
 <p><strong>RAT 2<br /></strong>Yeah, I guess you're right rat 1. He IS pretty dumb. I mean, have you heard his English accent? Me-I meame's Tigger, me – I'm really stupid. Meow….</p> 
 <p><strong>RAT 1<br /></strong>Ha ha ha ha, that's really very good Rat 2.</p>

 <p><strong>RAT 2<br /></strong>The cat is flat, repeat: The cat is flat. Over.</p> 
 <p><strong>RAT 1<br /></strong>Good work Rat 2! Now let's rescue Apple.</p> 
 <p><strong>RAT 2<br /></strong><strong>Roger that</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>COMMUTER 1<br /></strong>I say, what IS THAT thing?</p> 
 <p><strong>COMMUTER 2<br /></strong>I say, Ugh!</p> 
 <p><strong>COMMUTER 3<br /></strong>I think it's a pizza.</p> 
 <p><strong>COMMUTER 4<br /></strong>No, it's some sort of furry… Frisbee.</p> 
 <p><strong>TIGGER<br /></strong>Meow…</p> 
 <p><strong>TANOY<br /></strong>MIND THE CAT… MIND THE CAT…&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Scene 8 – Derring-do</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>NARRATOR<br /></strong>So it looks like Tigger has lost one of his nine lives but what about Apple? Will the rats reach him before the evil SHED OF NIGHTMARES sends him completely nuts?</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>The <strong>crackle </strong>of an open fire! The <strong>rustle </strong>of Autumn leafs! <strong>Swish</strong>, swish! The jolly ice cream van doing his round! The warm <strong>smack </strong>of a cricket bat hitting a six! Oh… I don't know how much more of this I can take… Dick, where ARE you?!<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>RAT 2<br /></strong>My nose is telling me this is the right spot! Apple?</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Yes! Yes! It's me! Is that really you, Rat 1 or is it just another effect?</p> 
 <p><strong>RAT 2<br /></strong>It's not Rat 1, but it's not an effect either! This is Rat 2. Rat 1 is outside together with rats 3 to infinity – we've all come to save you, Apple!</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Oh guys! You're the best.</p> 
 <p><strong>RAT 2<br /></strong>No time for that. Let's get out of here quick.</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Oh sweet, sweet birdsong! How I longed for you in there! Rustle of trees, I thought about you <strong>for every waking second </strong>of my <strong>ordeal</strong>! Darling traffic noise, it was only when you were taken from me that -</p> 
 <p><strong>RAT 3<br /></strong>Come on Apple, we need to <strong>scram </strong>before Franky gets back!</p> 
 <p><strong>FRANKY<br /></strong>Oh yes, let's go before that nasty Franky Banky comes back!</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>I wish he would stop creeping up on us like that!</p> 
 <p><strong>FRANKY<br /></strong>Really, Apple I owe you SO much. That's twice in one day you've led me to a huge number of rats. It's just a shame that I don't have dear Tigger here to catch them all for me. I'm not sure what's happened to him – he seems to be delayed. But anyway, it doesn't matter at all because I have this enormous electric chocolate stun gun! It will turn all of these rats into chocolate mice and make me Lord Mayor of London! Let me just turn it on…. Come on, come on… It takes a little while to warm up… but it's a very special weapon, you’ll see in a minute…</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Franky?</p> 
 <p><strong>FRANKY<br /></strong>Hang on…</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>I hate to tell you this, but, he's behind you…</p> 
 <p><strong>FRANKY<br /></strong>Who is?</p> 
 <p><strong>BIG VOICE<br /></strong>ZAPPO THE WON-DER HORSE!!!!</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. BOTTOM<br /></strong>That's us. Now, everybody just take it easy, stay calm… this is quite a dangerous situation and we don't want any accidents.</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. TOP<br /></strong>Hold it right there, Franky! Where's Apple?!</p> 
 <p><strong>FRANKY<br /></strong>Apple? Why, he's right there! You can take him if you want. I have no further use for him.</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. TOP<br /></strong>Oh. Are you OK, little cat?</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Well, I've had better days but… you know… I'm coping.</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. BOTTOM<br /></strong>Well that's good news. You know, I think we've done a good job here, Top. We've found the cat, he looks fine, so let's take him back to Dick and then we can all have a nice cup of tea.</p> 
 <p><strong>RAT 1<br /></strong>Wait! You can't leave us here with him! He's totally crazy! And he's got an enormous electric chocolate stun gun!</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. TOP<br /></strong>No – don't worry little creatures, of course we won't leave you. <strong>Hand over </strong>the gun, Franky.</p> 
 <p><strong>FRANKY<br /></strong>Ha! You must think I'm stupid!</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. TOP<br /></strong>We mean it. Hand it over now.</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. BOTTOM<br /></strong>Stop Top! He's going to fire it at us!</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. TOP<br /></strong>Well, if you won't give it, we'll have to take it!</p> 
 <p><strong>FRANKY<br /></strong>Ugh!</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. BOTTOM<br /></strong>Ah!</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Ow!</p> 
 <p><strong>RAT 2<br /></strong>Eek!</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. BOTTOM<br /></strong>Top, What have we done?</p> 
 <p><strong>Z. TOP<br /></strong>Bottom, I think we've just made Franky Banky a much sweeter man.</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>That is, without a doubt, the largest chocolate mouse I have ever seen in my life.</p> 
 <p><strong>Scene 9 – All's well that ends</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>NARRATOR<br /></strong>So, where's Dick Whittington all this time? Isn't he supposed to be the hero? Doesn't he want to be Lord Mayor of London anymore?</p> 
 <p><strong>SNOW<br /></strong>…It's very valuable, I think. I don't know, it's some kind of talking mirror, that's what I've heard anyway.</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>A talking mirror?</p> 
 <p><strong>SNOW<br /></strong>Yahuh. I think she bought it in America.</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Is it for blind people?</p> 
 <p><strong>SNOW<br /></strong>No, no, you ask it questions and it answers them. Like she asked it 'Who's <strong>the fairest </strong>of them all?' and apparently this mirror said that I was…</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Well, you know, that's no surprise to me. You are very, very pretty…</p> 
 <p><strong>SNOW<br /></strong>Really? Do you think so?</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Oh come on Snow, you must know you're gorgeous!</p> 
 <p><strong>SNOW<br /></strong>Well, I did have a suspicion… but it's ever so nice to hear it confirmed.</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>You're beautiful…. And if I were more than just a rotten Assistant Paperclips Officer I'd ask you to…</p> 
 <p><strong>SNOW<br /></strong>Ask me to what, Dick?</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Well… I'd ask you to be my girlfriend. But I know that a <strong>swell </strong>girl like you <strong>would never be seen dead </strong>with an ordinary guy like me… would you?</p> 
 <p><strong>SNOW<br /></strong>No… but… maybe if your cat does really well in the Rat-Catching Contest and you become Lord Mayor then -</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>The Rat-Catching Contest! I completely forgot about that! It's five past four – the tail counting will have already started! Come on, we're late!</p> 
 <p><strong>FULBRIGHT<br /></strong>And lastly, with an absolutely incredible thirty-one tails we have Tiddles! Can we get a warm saucer of milk for young Tiddles? And will the owner please come forward?</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>I can't see Apple anywhere!</p> 
 <p><strong>SNOW<br /></strong>They're about to announce the winner!</p> 
 <p><strong>FULBRIGHT<br /></strong>He doesn't have an owner? So… what do we do now? – we can't have a cat as Lord Mayor!</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong><strong><em>Quelle surprise</em></strong><em>. </em>I knew Apple wouldn't help me become Lord Mayor. He really is the most selfish animal in the whole world…</p> 
 <p><strong>SNOW<br /></strong>Wait Dick…</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>What?</p> 
 <p><strong>SNOW<br /></strong>That music… It must mean Apple's coming back just in time…</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>You're right!</p> 
 <p><strong>FULBRIGHT<br /></strong>Well, it's the first time it's happened in eight hundred years, but I can now announce that… hang on, I think we have a last-minute entrant… we have a cat at the back of the crowd… who appears to be floating.</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Look! There's Apple! But he's not floating, he's being carried…</p> 
 <p><strong>SNOW<br /></strong>By rats!</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Good people of London… do not run away in fright! I come in peace and goodwill as an ambassador for my good friends, the rats of London, who today saved my life. I have something very important to say about the rats of London. Too long they've been <strong>confined </strong>to the shadows and sewers of our great city, afraid for their tiny lives, while we hunt them down with traps and poisons and <strong>so-called </strong>'sporting events' like this. Too long, we have <strong>retained </strong>false ideas and <strong>stereotypes </strong>about our <strong>fellow </strong>creatures – who are actually very clean animals.</p> 
 <p><strong>SOMEONE<br /></strong>What about <strong>the Plague </strong>then?</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Oh, that was ages ago! You know, plagues… happen from time to time, and everybody goes a bit crazy, and some people die, but we haven't had a plague in this country for over three hundred years … I just think… we need <strong>to get over </strong>the Plague… If you make my master, Dick Whittington, Lord Mayor of London, he'll work with the rats of London to ensure that we never see a plague ever again!</p> 
 <p><strong>FULBRIGHT<br /></strong>What is your name, good cat?</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>My name is Apple, my lady.</p> 
 <p><strong>FULBRIGHT<br /></strong>That's a very strange name for a cat, but I can now tell you that you are the winner of the 134th Rat-Catching Contest! Who is your master?</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>That's me, I'm his master, my lady. Here I am, Dick Whittington.&nbsp;Well done Apple. ConRATulations. Get it? ConRATulations-</p> 
 <p><strong>FULBRIGHT<br /></strong>Is this man really your master?</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Hmmm…. I'm not sure actually…</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Apple! What do you mean, 'I'm not sure'? It's me, Dick! Your old <strong>buddy</strong>!</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>I've never seen this man before in my life.</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>How can you say that? I'm your oldest friend. Come on, let's go out to celebrate. I'll get you that nice tuna steak I promised.</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Oh you're all friendly now, now that you're about to become Lord Mayor of London. Where were you when I needed you? Getting cosy with Princess over there, <strong>no doubt</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Ah yes, Apple. I want you to meet Snow White.</p> 
 <p><strong>SNOW<br /></strong>Hello Apple. I've heard all about you.</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>I'm sure you have.</p> 
 <p><strong>FULBRIGHT<br /></strong>Look, I really need to get home. Is he your owner or not?</p> 
 <p><strong>APPLE<br /></strong>Maybe. Oh all right. Yes, he's my owner.</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>Oh Apple, thank you! I'll never forget this!</p> 
 <p><strong>FULBRIGHT<br /></strong>Dick Whittington, I hereby pronounce you Lord&nbsp;Mayor of London!</p> 
 <p><strong>NARRATOR<br /></strong>And so, the Lord Mayor's carriage makes its way slowly down Oxford Street, surrounded by crowds of rats, cats and people. What a fine summer's day to have a Lord-Mayor-making-celebration. Yes and what a fine young man this Richard Whittington is. Let's just hope he's got enough <strong>spunk </strong>for this most difficult and challenging job. There are so many things that a Lord Mayor has to do… he has to ensure that Big Ben is fed twice a day, and that all tourists pronounce the word 'Greenwich' correctly and of course his most important job of all is to make sure that the entire city of London never, ever runs out of paperclips…</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>What's that you say? Paperclips! I thought I <strong>was finished with </strong>all that! Oh well, at least as Lord Mayor of London I'll be able to marry Snow White.</p> 
 <p><strong>SNOW<br /></strong>What's that you say? Marry you! I said I'd <strong>go out with </strong>you, but no one ever mentioned the big white dress! <strong>One step at a time</strong>, Lord Mayor!</p> 
 <p><strong>DICK<br /></strong>OK, OK… one step at a time. But…you will go out with me, won't you?</p> 
 <p><strong>SNOW<br /></strong>On a trial basis – OK. I'll go out with you.</p> 
 <p><strong>NARRATOR<br /></strong>And so they might not be <strong>happy ever after</strong>, but let's hope our friends Dick Whittington, his cat Apple and Snow White will be moderately content for a good amount of time… The End. Dick Whittington was played by Jackie Dalton, Apple by William Kremer; Neil Edgeller was Franky Banky; Snow White was played by Elena Newton and Amber Barnfather was Tigger. Rats 1-30 were all played by Catherine Chapman, Zappo the Wonder Horse -</p>

 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello. Alice has had lots of adventures in Wonderland. Now, she has been called as a witness in the trial of the Knave of Hearts. The King of Hearts is the judge, but Alice has grown so tall that her head reaches the top of the courthouse and all the people seem very far away.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>How small you all are!</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>The witness must come to the witness box!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice jumped up and knocked over the jury box. It was full of animals and they all fell out.</p> 
 <p><strong>Animals<br /></strong>Ooh, ow, oh are you hurt? Excuse me, is that my chair? Etc...</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>I'm so sorry!</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>What do you know about this business?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Nothing at all!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The King looked in his Book of&nbsp;<strong>Rules</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Rule forty-two. &quot;All&nbsp;<strong>persons</strong>&nbsp;more than a mile high must leave the court.&quot;</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>I'm not a mile high!</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Indeed you are not! You are nearly two miles high!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Well, I'm not going! And&nbsp;<strong>you can't make</strong>&nbsp;me!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice had grown a little bit more, and the King, who was now the size of Alice's shoe,&nbsp;<strong>could see</strong>&nbsp;she was right about that part. His face went very&nbsp;<strong>pale</strong>&nbsp;and he closed&nbsp;his Book of Rules.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>White Rabbit. Ask the jury: what is their decision about this matter? Did the Knave steal the Queen's tarts?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>But there was more&nbsp;<strong>evidence.</strong>&nbsp;The White Rabbit gave a letter to the King, who opened it and turned to the Knave of Hearts.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Knave of Hearts, did you write this?</p> 
 <p><strong>Knave of Hearts<br /></strong>I didn't write it! Look at the end of it: there is no name written there!</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Then you are not a honest man! An honest man always signs his work! Read the letter!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And the White Rabbit read the letter. No-one understood a single word of it.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>That's the most important evidence we've heard today!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>I don't believe there's any meaning in it!</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>If there's no meaning in it, then we don't need to try to find any! Jury, what is your decision?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The Queen stamped her feet.</p> 
 <p><strong>Queen<br /></strong>No, no no!&nbsp;<strong>Punishment</strong>&nbsp;first, decision afterwards!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>That's nonsense! The punishment comes last!</p> 
 <p><strong>Queen<br /></strong>Be quiet!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>I won't!</p> 
 <p><strong>Queen<br /></strong>Off with her head!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>No-one moved. Alice realised she had grown to her full size.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Who cares about you? All of you!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice looked down at the little people all around her. She suddenly realised…</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>You're nothing but a pack of cards!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>As soon as she said this, the animals, the birds, the King and Queen and everyone else turned into a pack of cards and they all flew up into the air and came flying down upon her. The cards fluttered and flew all around her head and shoulders and Alice gave a scream as she tried to beat them off with her hands…</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Ohhhh!!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And then another strange thing happened to Alice. She found herself back on the riverbank where our story began. She opened her eyes and saw her sister smiling at her.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice's sister<br /></strong>Wake up, Alice dear! What a long sleep you've had!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice's sister gently brushed away some dead leaves that had fallen from the tree and onto her face.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Oh… I've had such a curious dream.&nbsp;There was a White Rabbit and … I got bigger and smaller … and I met a caterpillar and a Hatter … and played croquet and … a cat that smiled and … so many things.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice told her sister all about the Wonderland in her dream and the adventures she had had there. Perhaps one day Alice will dream herself back to Wonderland. If she does, I'll be sure to tell you. Goodbye.</p>

 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello. Alice is having lots adventures in Wonderland. Now, she's in a courtroom full of animals. Everybody is waiting for the trial to start. The Queen and the King of Hearts have already arrived and they are sitting on their <strong>thrones</strong>. &nbsp;The rest of the room was filled with birds and animals and the whole pack of playing-card people. Alice saw the White Rabbit. He was holding a <strong>trumpet </strong>in one handand alarge piece of paper in the other. The White Rabbit blew the trumpet.</p> 
 <p><strong>White Rabbit<br /></strong>Silence in the court!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The trial started. The King was the <strong>judge</strong> and twelve animals were the <strong>jury</strong>. The King spoke first.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Read the accusation!</p> 
 <p><strong>White Rabbit<br /></strong>The Queen of Hearts, she made some <strong>tarts</strong>,<br />All on a summer day.<br />The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts<br />And took them quite away.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Knave of Hearts, what do you say?</p> 
 <p><strong>Knave of Hearts<br /></strong>It wasn't me! I didn't do it!</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Silence! Call the first <strong>witness</strong>!</p> 
 <p><strong>White Rabbit<br /></strong>Bring in the first witness!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The first witness was the Hatter. He looked very <strong>nervous</strong>. He came into the court with a cup of tea in one shaking hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Give your evidence Hatter, and don't be nervous, or you'll lose your head!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The King's words made the Hatter even more frightened. He was so confused and that he took a large bite out of his teacup instead of his bread and butter.</p> 
 <p><strong>Hatter<br /></strong>I'm a poor man, your Majesty.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>You're a very poor speaker.</p> 
 <p><strong>White Rabbit<br /></strong>Poor Hatter. He didn't use to be mad, you know. He used to be quite normal.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>And I used to be taller…</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice began to have a curious feeling. It was a feeling she remembered.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Ohh.. I'm growing again!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>No-one noticed that Alice was getting taller. They were all watching the Hatter, who was too frightened to speak.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>You may go. Call the next witness!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The next witness was the cook.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Cook, what are tarts made of?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cook<br /></strong>Pepper, mostly.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Everybody started sneezing. Nobody seemed to notice Alice growing taller and taller. By the time they stopped sneezing, the cook had disappeared.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Never mind! Call the next witness!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice watched as the White Rabbit studied the piece of paper, looking for the name of the next witness. Imagine her surprise when he straightened up, took a deep breath and shouted the name of the next witness…</p> 
 <p><strong>White Rabbit<br /></strong>Alice!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Everybody in the courtroom turned to look at Alice. Alice felt herself grow a little taller, as she took a deep breath, and stepped forward. Next time, I'll tell you what happened when Alice gives her evidence and the White Rabbit reads a letter from the Knave of Hearts. Curiouser and curiouser… Goodbye.&nbsp;</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello! After all her adventures, Alice has finally found the beautiful garden she's been looking for all this time. It's full of beautiful white roses. Alice wandered through the flowers until she saw a gardener. He was doing something very strange...</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Why are you painting the roses red?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gardener<br /></strong>The Queen - she wants red roses and I put white roses in by mistake. If the Queen finds them, she'll cut my head off! Oh no! Here comes the Queen!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The gardener threw himself to the ground and lay with his face down. A line of&nbsp;<strong>soldiers</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>courtiers</strong>&nbsp;came marching into the rose garden. They didn't look like people at all. They looked exactly like playing cards: their bodies were square and flat with their heads at the top and their hands and feet in the four corners. First came a group of ten soldiers, who were decorated with black clubs, then came ten of the Queen's servants, who were covered in red diamonds. Then came all the princes and princesses, wearing red hearts. The&nbsp;<strong>Knave of Hearts</strong>&nbsp;was carrying a crown on a cushion, and last of all came the King and Queen of Hearts. When they got to Alice, everybody stopped. The Queen looked at Alice.</p> 
 <p><strong>Queen<br /></strong>Who is this?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>I'm Alice,&nbsp;<strong>Your Majesty.</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Queen<br /></strong>Can you play croquet?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Yes!</p> 
 <p><strong>Queen<br /></strong>Come on then! Everyone get to your places!</p> 
 <p><strong>Animals<br /></strong>I'm over here... Are you over there? This is place, no this is your place, are we ready?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Everyone began running in different directions until they got into place and the game began. It was a very curious game: everything seemed to be alive! The balls were&nbsp;<strong>hedgehogs</strong>&nbsp;and the croquet mallets were&nbsp;<strong>flamingos</strong>. All the playing-card-soldiers bent over so they looked like&nbsp;<strong>arches</strong>. The players had to catch the flamingos first, which wasn't easy because they kept flying away. When the flamingos were caught, each player held their flamingo tightly under one arm, with the long neck and head hanging down to the ground. Then the hedgehogs curled up into spiky balls – and the players used the flamingos' heads to hit the hedgehogs so that they rolled through the playing-card soldier arches.</p> 
 <p><strong>Animals<br /></strong>Is it my turn? Oh good shot! Have another go... oh do stand still! Very nicely played, it's your turn again, very good, etc...</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>What a curious game! I suppose I should play.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>It was a very curious game! There didn't seem to be any rules. Everyone played at the same time and the hedgehogs kept running away. Alice took a flamingo and tried to hit a hedgehog with it. But the flamingo moved its head and she missed. Soon the players began arguing and fighting for the hedgehogs and the Queen went around stamping her feet and shouting at everyone.</p> 
 <p><strong>Queen<br /></strong>Off with your head! Off with her head!</p> 
 <p><strong>Animals</strong><br />No it isn't your turn! That's my ball, give me my hedgehog! It's my turn, not yours! Is that my flamingo? That's cheating!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>How&nbsp;<strong>will I get out</strong>&nbsp;of here?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>As Alice was looking around for a way to escape, suddenly the Cheshire-Cat appeared in the air. He wasn't sitting on anything, he was just floating.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cheshire-Cat<br /></strong>Are you enjoying the croquet?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>No. I don't think they play fairly at all. Everyone is arguing and there aren't any rules.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cheshire-Cat<br /></strong>How do you like the Queen?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Not at all! I suppose I should try to play or&nbsp;<strong>she might cut off my head</strong>!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice went to find her hedgehog. She found it having a fight with another one. While she was trying to pull the two animals apart, her flamingo flew away.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Oh dear! I'm not doing very well at this game.&nbsp;<strong>What will the Queen think</strong>?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice was right to worry. Most of the other players had made the Queen angry for one reason or another and the soldiers took them away one by one. Soon there were only the King, the Queen and Alice left in the game. The Queen turned to Alice.</p> 
 <p><strong>Queen<br /></strong>You! Come here! Who were you talking to?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>If you please, your Majesty...</p> 
 <p><strong>Voice<br /></strong>The&nbsp;<strong>trial&nbsp;</strong>is starting! The&nbsp;<strong>trial&nbsp;</strong>is starting!</p> 
 <p><strong>Queen<br /></strong>The trial! Oh good! I love trials! Come along!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice had no choice but to follow the Queen. We'll leave her there for now. Next time. I'll tell you all about the Knave of Hearts, the stolen jam tarts and what happened when Alice met the Hatter and The White Rabbit again. Goodbye.</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Hello! Alice is trying to find her way back to the beautiful garden she saw when she first arrived in Wonderland. On her way, she met the Cheshire-Cat in the woods, who told Alice about the March Hare and the Hatter. Alice found the March Hare and the Hatter, having a tea-party.</p> 
 <p><strong>Hatter and March Hare</strong><br />Would you like some tea? Tea? Yes please, and cake? One cake... two cakes? One lump or two?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice</strong><br />Curiouser and curiouser. They're having a tea-party. But where are all the guests?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />The Hatter and the March Hare were sitting at one end of a very long table, which had empty cups and plates all the way along it. But the only other guest was a mouse, who was sound asleep. Alice decided to join them.</p> 
 <p><strong>Hatter and March Hare</strong><br />No room here! I'm sorry, no room!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice</strong><br />There's plenty of room!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Alice sat down. The Hatter opened his eyes very wide.</p> 
 <p><strong>Hatter</strong><br />Why is a raven like a writing desk?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice</strong><br />Ooh, good. Riddles! I love riddles!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />The March Hare looked at Alice.</p> 
 <p><strong>March Hare</strong><br />You mean you know the answer, don't you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice</strong><br />Yes, I do.</p> 
 <p><strong>March Hare</strong><br />Then you should say what you mean!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice</strong><br />I do. At least, I mean what I say. That's the same thing, isn't it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Hatter</strong><br />But why is a raven like a writing-desk? Have you guessed the answer yet?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice</strong><br />No. I give up. What's the answer?</p> 
 <p><strong>Hatter</strong><br />I don't know! Do you know?</p> 
 <p><strong>March Hare</strong><br />I don't know either!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice</strong><br />I think you should only ask riddles if you know the answer.</p> 
 <p><strong>March Hare</strong><br />Have some more tea.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice</strong><br />I haven't had any tea, have I? So I can't take more.</p> 
 <p><strong>Hatter</strong><br />You mean you can't take less. It's very easy to take more than nothing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Alice got up and walked off without saying goodbye.</p> 
 <p><strong>March Hare</strong><br />More tea, Hatter?</p> 
 <p><strong>Hatter</strong><br />Don't mind if I do!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />The Hatter and the March Hare didn't seem to notice her leaving. Alice went back into the woods. She looked back as she walked away. The Hatter and the March Hare were trying to put the mouse into the teapot.</p> 
 <p><strong>Hatter and Hare</strong><br />Mousey mousey! In you go! Plop! Oh, he does wriggle so. More tea?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice</strong><br />I'll never go there again! That was the stupidest tea-party I've ever been to in all my life!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Back in the woods, Alice saw a tree with a door in it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice</strong><br />That's very curious! I wonder what could be behind a door in a tree...</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />In Wonderland anything can be behind any door. Alice opened the door and there she was at the beginning of her adventures again – in the hall with the locked doors and the table with the little key on it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice</strong><br />I remember that little door and the key! This time I know what to do! I'm finally going to get into the garden!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Alice had learned a lot about growing and shrinking in Wonderland. She took the key off the table first… and then ate some of the mushroom she had taken from the caterpillar and put in her pocket. Soon she was small enough to unlock the door and go through it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice</strong><br />Oh, it's so pretty here!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />We'll leave Alice here for now, happy in the garden at last. Soon, she's going to meet the Queen and play croquet. Will she still be happy then? I'll tell you next time.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello. Alice is in the woods. She's trying to find her way back to the beautiful garden that she saw when she first arrived in Wonderland. Here she is, outside a little house. She's wondering who lives there.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>I wonder who could live in such a little house!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Before she had the chance to wonder for very long,&nbsp;<strong>a fish ran&nbsp;</strong>out of the woods and knocked on the door. The fish was wearing a footman's uniform.&nbsp;<strong>Another footman opened&nbsp;</strong>the door. Alice was near enough to hear what the fish said.</p> 
 <p><strong>Footman<br /></strong>From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play&nbsp;<strong>croquet</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>The Duchess!!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice was so curious<strong>&nbsp;she went</strong>&nbsp;to knock on the door. But there was no use knocking, because it was so noisy inside the house that no-one could possibly hear her little knock. Alice was even more curious now so&nbsp;<strong>she opened</strong>&nbsp;the door…</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Hello?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And&nbsp;<strong>she found</strong>&nbsp;herself in a noisy, smoky kitchen. A cook was cooking a pan of soup over the fire and the Duchess was holding a crying baby. There was also a big cat who was sitting above the fire and smiling from ear to ear. Everyone was sneezing except the cook and the cat.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>There's too much pepper in that soup! Please would you tell me why&nbsp;<strong>your cat grins</strong>&nbsp;like that?</p> 
 <p><strong>The Duchess<br /></strong>It's a Cheshire-Cat, and that's why.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong><strong>I didn't know</strong>&nbsp;Cheshire-Cats grinned. In fact<strong>, I didn't know</strong>&nbsp;cats could grin.</p> 
 <p><strong>The Duchess<br /></strong>You don't know much, and that's a fact.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Just then,&nbsp;<strong>the cook took</strong>&nbsp;the pan of soup off the fire, and&nbsp;<strong>started</strong>&nbsp;throwing&nbsp;<strong>pots and pans</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>plates and dishes</strong>&nbsp;all around the kitchen.&nbsp;<strong>Some of them hit</strong>&nbsp;the Duchess, but&nbsp;<strong>she didn't seem</strong>&nbsp;to notice.&nbsp;<strong>Some of them hit</strong>&nbsp;the baby, who was crying anyway.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Oh please! The baby! Be careful!</p> 
 <p><strong>The Duchess<br /></strong>Here! You hold it if you like!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And&nbsp;<strong>the Duchess threw</strong>&nbsp;the baby at Alice who just managed to catch it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Ohhh!!</p> 
 <p><strong>The Duchess<br /></strong>I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And, with that, The Duchess left.&nbsp;<strong>Alice held</strong>&nbsp;the baby and wondered what to do with it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>What am I going to do with you? You're a strange shape… Oh! You're a not a baby. You're a… you're a pig!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>It was easy to decide what to do with a pig. Alice took it outside and let it go into the woods.&nbsp;<strong>The Cheshire-Cat sat</strong>&nbsp;in a tree and watched her.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Cheshire-Cat, could you tell me which way I should go?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cheshire-Cat<br /></strong>A Hatter lives over here, and a March Hare lives over there. They're both&nbsp;<strong>mad</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>But I don't want to meet mad people.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cheshire-Cat<br /></strong>Oh, we're all mad here. Are you playing croquet with the Queen today?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>I'd love to play croquet with the Queen… but&nbsp;<strong>she hasn't invited me</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cheshire-Cat<br /></strong>You'll see me there…</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The cat disappeared. Alice set off in the direction of the March Hare's house and soon she came to a house. Outside the house she saw a tea-party quite unlike any tea-party she had ever seen before. Next time, I'll tell you all about the Tea Party and what happened when&nbsp;<strong>Alice met</strong>&nbsp;the March Hare and the Hatter. Goodbye.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>After Alice frightened everyone by growing as big as a house, she ate some little cakes and&nbsp;<strong>shrank</strong>&nbsp;again. She&nbsp;doesn't like&nbsp;being so tiny, so she's looking for something to make her grow to the right size. But this is Wonderland and what she finds, sitting on top of a mushroom, is very curious indeed…</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Am I as small as a mushroom, or is the mushroom as tall as me? Ohh!!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Sitting on top of the mushroom was a blue caterpillar smoking a&nbsp;<strong>hookah pipe.</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Caterpillar<br /></strong>Who are you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>I… I'm not sure.&nbsp;I know&nbsp;who I was when I woke up this morning. But I've changed so many times since then!</p> 
 <p><strong>Caterpillar<br /></strong>What do you mean by that? Explain yourself!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>I can't explain myself because I'm not myself. It's very confusing…<strong>&nbsp;</strong>I think&nbsp;you should tell me who YOU are first.</p> 
 <p><strong>Caterpillar<br /></strong>Why?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Ummm…</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice couldn't think of any good reason. She decided to leave.</p> 
 <p><strong>Caterpillar<br /></strong>Come back! I have something important to say!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Yes?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Caterpillar<br /></strong>Don't be unhappy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Is that all?</p> 
 <p><strong>Caterpillar<br /></strong>No. So you think you've changed, do you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>I have, sir. I don't stay the same size for more than ten minutes!</p> 
 <p><strong>Caterpillar<br /></strong>What size do you want to be?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Oh,&nbsp;I don't mind. A little bit bigger is all I would like. Seven centimetres is such a terrible&nbsp;<strong>height</strong>!</p> 
 <p><strong>Caterpillar<br /></strong>It is a very good height! I myself am exactly seven centimetres in height!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And with that, the caterpillar crawled off the mushroom and away.</p> 
 <p><strong>Caterpillar<br /></strong>One side of the mushroom will make you grow taller. The other side will make you grow shorter. Seven centimetres indeed!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Hmmm… let me pull this side… and now this side…But which side is which?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>There was only one way to find out the answer to that question. Alice took a bite of one piece of the mushroom - and shrank so quickly that she hit her&nbsp;<strong>chin</strong>&nbsp;on her foot.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice</strong><br />Ouch!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Quickly, she ate some of the other piece of mushroom and …</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Where have my&nbsp;<strong>shoulders</strong>&nbsp;gone? And my hands – where are you, hands?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice grew and grew until her&nbsp;<strong>neck</strong>&nbsp;was as long as a snake. Up and up she grew, through the branches and leaves, until her head was higher than the trees. Alice found she could move her neck just like a snake, bending this way and that. She was about to use her long neck to push her head down into the trees&nbsp;and look for her shoulders and hands, when suddenly a furious bird flew at her.</p> 
 <p><strong>Bird<br /></strong>Snake! Snake!&nbsp;You want&nbsp;my eggs!&nbsp;I know!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>I'm not a snake! I'm a… I'm a little girl!</p> 
 <p><strong>Bird<br /></strong>Little girl or snake, it doesn't matter to me, you want my eggs just the same!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>I don't want your eggs, really I don't!</p> 
 <p><strong>Bird<br /></strong>Then be off with you! Go away!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The bird settled angrily into its nest. Alice ate a little of one side of the mushroom, then a little of the other, then a little of the first again until she was a good size. She decided to find her way back to the door to the beautiful garden that she saw when she first arrived in Wonderland. As she walked through the forest she found a little clearing, with a small house in it, not much more than a metre or so high.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>I wonder who lives here? The house is so small – anyone who lives here will surely be afraid of me!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice ate a little more of the mushroom and quickly brought herself down to the right size for this little house. Next time, Alice meets a walking fish, talks to a smiling cat and has to look after a baby. Goodbye.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello. Alice fell down a Rabbit Hole one day and found herself in a Wonderland, where animals talk, curious things happen and everything she eats and drinks makes her grow bigger or smaller. Now she is sitting alone. Suddenly, she heard footsteps. The White Rabbit was running towards her. He seemed to be very worried.</p> 
 <p><strong>White Rabbit<br /></strong>Oh dear! Where can I have dropped them? I must find them, or I'm sure The Duchess will <strong>chop</strong> <strong>off</strong> my head!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice guessed he was looking for the gloves and fan that he had dropped - but she didn't know where they were either. After all her growing and shrinking, Alice was exactly the same size as the rabbit. When the White Rabbit saw Alice, he spoke to her quite angrily.</p> 
 <p><strong>White Rabbit<br /></strong>Mary Ann! What are you doing out here? Run home this minute and get me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quickly!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>How surprised he'll be when he finds out I'm not Mary Ann!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong></p> 
 <p>Alice began to run, as the White Rabbit had told her, although she didn't quite know where she should run to. But soon, a little house appeared with the words 'W. Rabbit' written on the door.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>I won't knock on the door. The real Mary Ann might hear me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice crept into the house and went quietly upstairs to a little bedroom… and there she found two fans, three pairs of gloves and…</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Another bottle! I hope it makes me grow bigger again. I'm tired of being such a tiny little thing!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>…and sure enough, Alice began to grow. Taller and taller she grew, until…</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Ouch! My head! That's quite tall enough. That's tall enough! O-o-o-oh…</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice tried her hardest to stop growing - but it seemed to her like the harder she tried, the taller she grew. Soon Alice was so big that she filled the whole room. Her head pressed up against the ceiling, her arm went out of the window, and one of her feet went up the <strong>chimney</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>What will become of me now?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Outside the house, a crowd started to gather. Alice heard voices.</p> 
 <p><strong>Voices<br /></strong>Oh my, whatever could it be? What’s that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Soon, the White Rabbit arrived.</p> 
 <p><strong>White</strong> <strong>Rabbit<br /></strong>What's that in the window?</p> 
 <p><strong>Voice<br /></strong>It's an arm, sir!</p> 
 <p><strong>White Rabbit<br /></strong>An arm? Well, it's got no business being there! Bill! Bill! Fetch the <strong>ladder</strong> and take it away!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Bill was the <strong>gardener</strong>. He brought a ladder and climbed up on to the <strong>roof</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>White Rabbit<br /></strong>I won't have an arm in my bedroom! Down you go Bill, down the chimney!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Poor Bill went up the ladder and tried to go down the chimney. But Alice's foot was waiting for him… with a big kick.</p> 
 <p><strong>Bill<br /></strong>Ohhhhhhhh!!!!</p> 
 <p><strong>Voices<br /></strong>Quick, quick, help him, help him up. Give him some air…</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>There! That's got rid of him! Now what will they try?</p> 
 <p><strong>Voices<br /></strong>Cakes! Cakes! Try the cakes!</p> 
 <p><strong>White Rabbit<br /></strong>Yes! The cakes: bring the cakes! We'll need a lot of them. That's right. Now, everybody, throw them through the other window!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>What's this…? Oh! Lots and lots of little cakes. &nbsp;I wonder… If I ate them, would I shrink again? They must do something… and I must get out of this house. I'll try just one of them to start with.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice ate one of the little cakes, and soon found herself to be a little smaller. She ate another and another, until at last she was just the right size to run out of the bedroom… and out of the house.</p> 
 <p><strong>Voices<br /></strong>Look! There she is! Get her! Catch her, quickly!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>But Alice was too fast for them. She ran far away from the White Rabbit's house, deeper and deeper into the forest until she became quite lost. She was wondering what she could eat or drink to make her grow to the right size again, when suddenly, she saw in front of her a large mushroom - about the same size as herself, with a large blue <strong>caterpillar</strong> sitting on top of it, smoking a pipe and taking no notice of Alice at all. Will the caterpillar help Alice to grow again? I'll tell you next time.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello. So far, Alice had been very small, then very tall, then very small again in this strange Wonderland she found when she chased a talking rabbit and fell down the rabbit hole. Now she was swimming in a pool of her own tears, wondering what was going to happen next.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Ooh, whatever's this? It's a mouse! Hello mouse! You're a very big mouse… but then, I'm a very, very little girl today. Whatever next?&nbsp;<strong>If this mouse talks, I won't be at all surprised</strong>… Oh Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I'm very tired of swimming about here, Mouse! Mouse? Hmmm. Perhaps it doesn't understand English. Maybe it's a French mouse! Now, what was that French I learned in school? O&ugrave; est ma chatte?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mouse<br /></strong>Chatte? Cat! Did you say cat?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Oh, I'm so sorry Mouse! I forgot mice don't like cats.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mouse<br /></strong>Would you like cats if you were me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Well… perhaps not. But my cat Dinah is different. She's such a sweet, quiet thing.&nbsp;<strong>If you meet her, I'm sure you'll like her.</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Mouse<br /></strong>We won't talk about cats any more, thank you!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>We won't! Er… do you - do you er… like dogs? They can be so sweet and they kill all the rats… and… Oh dear!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Oh please come back, dear Mouse.&nbsp;<strong>We won't talk about cats or dogs, if you don't like them</strong>. Swim with me to the shore.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>So Alice and the mouse swam to the edge of the pool of tears. And as they swam, they were joined by lots of other&nbsp;<strong>creatures</strong>&nbsp;that had fallen into the pool, just like Alice and the mouse. There was a duck and a&nbsp;<strong>dodo&nbsp;</strong>and many other strange animals that Alice had never seen before. All the creatures had the same question.</p> 
 <p><strong>Animals<br /></strong>How can we get dry? What can we do? I'm so far away from my nest, that pool was very wet and salty, oh it's no good for my fur, etc…</p> 
 <p><strong>Dodo<br /></strong>We must have a Caucus-race!</p> 
 <p><strong>Animals<br /></strong>Hooray! Hoorah!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>What's a Caucus-race, Mr Dodo?</p> 
 <p><strong>Dodo<br /></strong>The best way to explain a Caucus-race is to have a Caucus-race!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>It was the strangest race Alice had ever seen. The Dodo marked a circle for the racecourse and everyone stood anywhere they wanted to. Nobody said &quot;One, two, three, go!&quot; but everyone started running. Alice ran too, although she didn't quite know where she should run to. Everyone ran left and right in any direction they pleased. But after half an hour of running, everybody was quite dry again.</p> 
 <p><strong>Dodo<br /></strong>The race is over!</p> 
 <p><strong>Multiple voices<br /></strong>But who has won? Did I win? Who is the winner?</p> 
 <p><strong>Dodo<br /></strong>Ah... yes... Who has won? Who has won? Everybody has won and everyone must have&nbsp;<strong>prizes</strong>! And she must give the prizes!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice didn't have any prizes for a Caucus-race with her, but she searched in her pockets and found some sweets. She had enough sweets to give exactly one sweet to every runner. &nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Here you are, one for you, and one for you…</p> 
 <p><strong>Animals<br /></strong>Thank you very much… oh dear, this has no taste whatsoever… oh, I shall choke…it's rather good, yes very tasty…</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>And one for you – now, does everybody have one? Oh, I must say, my cat Dinah would love a Caucus-race…</p> 
 <p><strong>Animals<br /></strong>Let's go! Come away! Time for bed! Oh, is it that time already? Cats - ugh!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Oh dear. I said it again. Come back! Please! I'm sorry! Poor Dinah. Nobody seems to like her down here and I'm sure she's the best cat in the world!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Poor Alice felt very lonely and sad. She cried quietly to herself for a while. But in a little while, she heard footsteps in the distance. She looked up to see who it was. Next time, I'll tell you who the footsteps belonged to, and how Alice got so big she filled a whole house, and what happened when she kicked poor Bill the lizard up and out of the chimney. Goodbye.</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello! Alice is having some very&nbsp;<strong>curious</strong>&nbsp;adventures at the bottom of a rabbit hole. She drank a drink that made her very small indeed. But she wants to grow bigger so that she can reach the key that will unlock the tiny door to a beautiful garden. After eating some cake she found in a little glass box, Alice started to feel something …</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Curiouser and curiouser! I'm growing! My feet are so far away. Goodbye feet! How will I put my shoes and socks on, I wonder? Ouch!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice grew so big that her head hit the&nbsp;<strong>ceiling</strong>! It was easy to reach the table now. She picked up the tiny key and rushed to the door. But in her excitement, she forgot something again…</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Ohhhh… this is hopeless! I'm much too big for this door now! I'll never get into the garden! I can only look through the door with one eye! Oh…</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice was over nine feet tall, and when a girl that big cries, the&nbsp;<strong>tears</strong>&nbsp;are big too. Alice cried and cried until half the hall was filledwith a salty pool of tears. After a time, Alice heard a little pattering of feet in the distance. She dried her eyes to see what was coming.</p> 
 <p><strong>White Rabbit<br /></strong>Oh! I'm late! I'm so very late! I was told to be early and I'm going to be late. The Duchess will be waiting. Oh my! Oh my! She will be so very angry with me! Oh my!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The sight of The White Rabbit,&nbsp;<strong>splendidly</strong>&nbsp;dressed in his best clothes, and carrying a large&nbsp;<strong>fan</strong>&nbsp;and a pair of white leather gloves was enough to stop Alice's tears.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>If you please, sir…</p> 
 <p><strong>White Rabbit<br /></strong>Oh!! Oh my!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Don't go! I won't hurt – Oh dear! You've dropped your gloves… But look: what a pretty fan. And crying is such hot work. Oh, that's better. Oh dear… how strange everything is today. Yesterday things were normal. But today I'm not sure if I am the same girl who woke up this morning. But, if I'm not the girl who woke up this morning, the question is, &quot;Who am I?&quot;</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice fanned herself while she talked. She felt much cooler. But after a minute or two, something started happening.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Oh: Here's that feeling again.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Then something kept happening. Alice kept fanning herself.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>I don't believe it. I must be… I am! I'm growing smaller again. Smaller than the table. Hello feet! It's good to see you again.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Soon Alice was smaller than ever. She was still&nbsp;<strong>shrinking</strong>&nbsp;and shrinking and she didn't know why.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Oh dear - I'm getting very small. Oh… I'm getting much too small! Oh dear - I shall fade away altogether! Ohh…! The fan? The fan!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Just in time. Alice threw the fan on the floor, so she wouldn't get any smaller. &nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>That was a lucky<strong>&nbsp;escape</strong>! But now I'm small enough to get into the garden!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Poor Alice! There she stood at the little door - but it was locked again. And there was the little key, back in its place, out of reach, on the table.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Oh not again! This is hopeless. I'll never get that key now. I so badly wanted to see the garden. And things are worse than ever - I've never been so small as this in my life. Never!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Things were as bad as ever. And they were about to get worse...</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Ohhh!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And poor little Alice fell into a pool of her own tears. Luckily, she knew how to swim. But she wasn't the only one who had fallen into the pool. Next time, Alice meets a dodo, tries to make friends with a mouse, and joins in a very, very curious race. Goodbye.</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello. This is the story of an ordinary girl called Alice. Our story begins on an ordinary summer's day. Let's meet Alice: here she is, sitting next to the river with her sister on a very hot summer's afternoon. Her sister is reading a book, and with no-one to talk to, Alice is bored… and a bit sleepy. Soon, she'll be in a Wonderland full of strange and wonderful adventures… but Alice doesn't know that yet…</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Ohh… There's nothing to do… except lie on the grass and pick&nbsp;<strong>daisies.&nbsp;</strong>Shall I make a daisy chain for my dear little Dinah? Oh… I don't know… it's sooo hot… &nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>White Rabbit<br /></strong>Oh dear! Oh dear! I'm late! I'm so very late! Oh dear oh dear!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>A white rabbit! A talking white rabbit? Perhaps. But a rabbit with a pocket-watch? A rabbit with pockets? I must see where he's going!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice had never seen a rabbit with a pocket, or a waistcoat, or a pocket-watch before. So, she ran after the rabbit as fast as she could, and when the rabbit jumped down a large rabbit hole, Alice jumped straight after him.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Oohhhh… Either this hole is very deep or I'm falling very slowly. And what a curious rabbit-hole! Who would think a rabbit-hole would have bookshelves … and books … and maps … and jars of&nbsp;<strong>marmalade</strong>?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice fell down, down, down. She fell for so long that she began to think about Dinah, her cat.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Dinah will miss me tonight! I hope they'll remember her milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear, I wish you were down here with me!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice was beginning to feel quite sleepy when suddenly, her fall was over and she found herself sitting on a pile of leaves and grass.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Ouch! Who's there?</p> 
 <p><strong>White Rabbit<br /></strong>Oh, my ears and whiskers! How late it's getting!!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Wait! Please sir, wait a moment!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The White Rabbit ran down a long tunnel. Alice ran after him. But when she reached the end of the tunnel she found only a long hall with doors all the way round. Alice tried to open the doors – but they were all locked. Then she saw a table with a tiny key on it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>These doors are all too big. There must be a smaller door somewhere. I wonder… hmmm, let me look behind this little curtain… ooh! a tiny little door! Let me try the key… What a beautiful garden! But how can I visit it? The door is so tiny – I can't even fit my head through! Oh! It's no use. I wish I could fold up like a&nbsp;<strong>telescope!</strong> Wait a minute… what's this? It certainly wasn't here before. A bottle –&nbsp;<strong>I wonder what it is?</strong>&nbsp;Let me see the label. Hmmm: Drink me… Oh! Oh! Ohhhhhh!!!! What a curious feeling! I'm folding up like a telescope!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And so she was! Alice got smaller and smaller until she was small enough to fit through the door. But she'd forgotten something …</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>The key!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice was too small to reach the key on the table. She tried and tried to climb up the table leg but it was too slippery. When she had tired herself out with trying, poor little Alice sat down and cried.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>It's no use. I can't reach the key, so I can't get into the garden and that's that. There's no use crying like that! Alice! I advise you to stop this minute! Oohh… what's this? A little glass box… with cake inside! Ooh: and there's a note. Eat me. Hmmm.&nbsp;<strong>I wonder if it will make me grow...</strong>&nbsp;if I grow, I will be able to reach the key. But what if makes me even smaller? Well, if it makes me smaller, I will be able to&nbsp;<strong>creep</strong>&nbsp;under the door.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And Alice began to eat the cake. Did she grow big enough to reach the key? Or perhaps the cake made her small enough to creep under the door and into her beautiful garden. I'll tell you what happened next time. Goodbye.&nbsp;</p>

"<p><strong>TODAY - IN THE ARCTIC</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Captain<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Hello I'm Captain Walton. Something unexpected happened on my way here to the Arctic. I still can't make sense of it. I and my crew found this poor man on the ice. He was half dead when we rescued him. He said his name was Viktor Frankenstein. He was a good man but a very sad one. He told us a very strange story about a monster he created. And this monster was responsible for many deaths. He said he wished to warn me about the dangers of science but I think what he wanted was to get that story off of his chest. We took care of him but unfortunately he died. Poor man. What a crazy story!</p> 
 <p><strong>Crewman<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Captain, I have some good news.</p> 
 <p><strong>Captain<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Yes, sailor.</p> 
 <p><strong>Crewman<br clear=""none"" /></strong>There's a change in the wind. It's warmer. The ice <strong>is disappearing</strong> and we <strong>are going to be</strong> able to continue our trip to the North Pole.</p> 
 <p><strong>Captain<br clear=""none"" /></strong>That is really good news. Thank you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Crewman<br clear=""none"" /></strong>I <strong>thought</strong> you needed some cheering up. It's sad what <strong>happened</strong> to that poor man, Frankenstein, who died earlier, isn't it? We gave him blankets, hot soup, but he was already very weak.</p> 
 <p><strong>Captain<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Yes. Yes, I know. What else could we have done?</p> 
 <p><strong>Crewman<br clear=""none"" /></strong><strong>Do you think</strong> that story he told us is true? About the monster? I remember the big shadow we saw far away, in the middle of the ice, before we rescued Frankenstein.</p> 
 <p><strong>Captain<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Yes, it was moving very quickly before it disappeared. But maybe it was something else. How can we be sure? All <strong>we've been able to see</strong> for weeks is this ice!</p> 
 <p><strong>Crewman<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Yes. I guess so. Well sir, let me go back to preparing the ship to continue our journey.</p> 
 <p><strong>Captain<br clear=""none"" /></strong>What's... what's that? Someone's crying. The sound is coming from the cabin where Frankenstein's body is. Let me see what this is...</p> 
 <p><strong>IN THE SHIP'S CABIN</strong>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Captain<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Oh, who... who're you? You're so big, and...</p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Ugly. You mean ugly.</p> 
 <p><strong>Captain<br clear=""none"" /></strong>You must be the Creature! His story was true!</p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Yes. He built me and brought me to life... to a very sad life. Now <strong>he's gone</strong>. I found him dead.</p> 
 <p><strong>Captain<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Well, at least... at least he's in peace now. He was carrying great pain in his heart. But <strong>why are you holding</strong> his body and crying? I thought you wanted to kill him?</p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>I came to tell him I'm so very sorry.</p> 
 <p><strong>Captain<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Sorry?! Is it true? Maybe you're crying because you can't hurt him anymore. You caused him so many problems! All those deaths...</p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>And what good has it done? I wanted to be kind and have love and friendship. But all I got was hatred. People feared me, they attacked me. And I hated them and attacked them in return. Now I hate myself.</p> 
 <p><strong>Captain<br clear=""none"" /></strong>And so <strong>what are you going to do</strong>?<strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Only death can end my suffering. I'll go north, build a fire and throw myself into the flames. Then it will be over.</p> 
 <p><strong>Captain<br clear=""none"" /></strong>But are... are you sure? Does it have to be this way?</p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>That's the only way. My body will be blown to the sea by the wind and my spirit will finally be free. Goodbye, Frankenstein. Goodbye, sir. Don't follow me.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Captain<br clear=""none"" /></strong>There goes the Creature running fast across the ice. What a powerful being and how sorry he was! Oh, <strong>he's disappeared</strong> now... Poor creature. In the future we might know him as Frankenstein. That was the name of his creator. He, or... it, didn't even get a name. It's just called the Creature. A Creature which will never be seen again.</p>

 <p><strong><span>Viktor Frankenstein<br /></span></strong><span>Hello, I'm scientist Viktor Frankenstein. And I'm here in the Arctic, the end of the Earth, because I'm looking for the Creature which destroyed my happiness. The last time I was happy was… with Elizabeth. Our wedding day was coming…</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>IN THE PAST – AT THE FRANKENSTEIN'S HOME IN GENEVA</span></strong></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Elizabeth<br /></span></strong><span>Let me check the guest list again</span><span>…</span><span> How many guests</span><span> have we planned earlier, Mr Frankenstein?</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Viktor Frankenstein's Father<br /></span></strong><span>There were 60, the last time I counted, dear Elizabeth. </span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Elizabeth<br /></span></strong><span>Is the house<strong> big enough </strong></span><span>for all our guests?</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Viktor Frankenstein's Father<br /></span></strong><span>Yes, it is, my darling. Invite more people. Let's have a banquet and plenty of good wine! </span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Elizabeth<br /></span></strong><span>How much wine</span><span> shall we order? Are two hundred bottles <strong>too many</strong></span><span>?</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Viktor Frankenstein's Father<br /></span></strong><span>No.</span><span>I'll pay for it all gladly. Nothing is </span><strong><span>too expensive</span></strong><span> for my dear son and his bride. Let's all drink and b</span><span>e merry! It will be a wedding nobody will ever forget! Are you happy, my dear?</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Elizabeth<br /></span></strong><span>Oh, I'm <strong>very </strong></span><span>happy! </span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>TODAY – IN THE ARCTIC</span></strong></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Viktor Frankenstein<br /></span></strong><span>It's <strong>very</strong></span><span> cold here! Well, Elizabeth and I got married on a warm day. There was a lot of catching up with friends. Elizabeth looked so pretty. But I was worried. I got used to walking around with a gun in my pocket. The threat by the Creature was </span><strong><span>very</span></strong><span> much alive in my mind…</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>IN THE PAST</span></strong></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Creature<br /></span></strong><span>I'll have my revenge. I'll be with you on your wedding night!</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>TODAY – IN THE ARCTIC</span></strong></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Viktor Frankenstein<br /></span></strong><span>I didn't give the monster a bride so it said it would destroy my life. It killed my best friend Henry, my brother William and his nanny Justine was blamed for the boy's murder… and now it was coming after me. This was in my thoughts when we arrived for our honeymoon at the house we rented by the side of Lake Como in Italy. It was raining heavily…</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>IN THE PAST – AT A HOUSE BY LAKE COMO, ITALY</span></strong></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Elizabeth<br /></span></strong><span>It's a pity we have to close the windows. The view of the lake is fantastic!</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Viktor Frankenstein<br /></span></strong><span>Yes. But I'm sure the rain won't last. Why don't you go to the bedroom, my darling? </span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Elizabeth<br /></span></strong><span>Aren't you coming?</span><span>What are you looking for, dear Viktor? </span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Viktor Frankenstein<br /></span></strong><span>I just want to make sure that everything is alright and we are safe. I'll go as soon as I do that, my sweet Elizabeth. </span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Elizabeth<br /></span></strong><span>Are you expecting someone?</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Viktor Frankenstein<br /></span></strong><span>No, darling wife. Go and I'll join you as soon as I can. I don't want anything to worry you.</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>TODAY – IN THE ARCTIC</span></strong></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Viktor Frankenstein<br /></span></strong><span>I was indeed expecting something to happen: a battle to the death between me and the Creature. I didn't care if it was too strong for me. I had <strong>enough</strong></span><span> hate in my heart to defeat the monster. I just didn't want Elizabeth to see the fight. I left the house with my gun and decided to walk around to check if it was there. But all of a sudden, a scream…</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>IN THE PAST – AT A HOUSE BY LAKE COMO, ITALY</span></strong></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Elizabeth<br /></span></strong><span>Ahhhhhhh!</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Viktor Frankenstein<br /></span></strong><span>Elizabeth! Elizabeth!</span></p> 
 <p><strong>INSIDE THE HOUSE</strong></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Viktor Frankenstein<br /></span></strong><span>My dear Elizabeth! My beloved wife… is dead!!</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Creature<br /></span></strong><span>Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!</span><span><br /></span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Viktor Frankenstein<br /></span></strong><span>You, horrible Creature! I'll kill you! I'll put a bullet in your head!</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>SHOOTING</span></strong></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Viktor Frankenstein<br /></span></strong><span>I hate you! I hate you with all my heart! My Elizabeth! </span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>TODAY – IN THE ARCTIC</span></strong></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Viktor Frankenstein<br /></span></strong><span>William, Justine, Henry and now Elizabeth. There was nothing else for me and… for my father. As soon as he heard that my wife was killed on our wedding night, he fell ill and died heartbroken. And all because of me! I'd thought about telling Elizabeth that I had created a monster. But there wasn't <strong>enough</strong></span><span> time… After her death I tried to warn others and I was put in a hospital for a while. Nobody believed me… So I decided to put an end to the problem I had created and find the creature at once. The world </span><strong><span>is not big enough</span></strong><span> for both of us. I'm still looking for it. I might find it next time.</span></p>

"<p><strong><span>TODAY – IN THE ARCTIC</span></strong></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Viktor Frankenstein</span></strong></p> 
 <p><span>Hello. I'm scientist Viktor Frankenstein, here in the Arctic trying to find a monster I've created. I've been having all this trouble with one monster. And to think that I was about to create another one! The Creature threatened me and my family if I didn't make it a bride. Well, it said it felt lonely. There I was on a Scottish island far away working on it: mixing chemicals, sewing flesh and bone together. Then I thought it was madness and destroyed it! But the monster saw me doing it through a window. It was angry! Yes, very angry!</span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>IN THE PAST</strong><strong> – AT THE ORKNEY ISLANDS</strong></span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Creature<br /></span></strong><strong><span>How could you break</span><span> your promise? </span></strong><span>You have just destroyed my only hope of happiness! Do you think you'll get married and live happily with a wife while I am all alone and sad?</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Viktor Frankenstein<br /></span></strong><span>Go to hell, you horrible Creature!</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Creature<br /></span></strong><span>I'll have my revenge. I'll be with you on your wedding night!</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>TODAY – IN THE ARCTIC</span></strong></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Viktor Frankenstein<br /></span></strong><span>The threat kept ringing in my ears. Was he going to kill me? Elizabeth would be very upset! A dead husband on her wedding night! These thoughts were going round and round in my head when I collected the body parts of what would be the Creature's bride and put them in a basket. I dragged the heavy basket to my boat and I left the island. I threw the basket into the sea. </span><span>All of a sudden I felt better. I thought I had done the right thing.</span><span>And I found myself thinking of my bright future with Elizabeth, my love, and my father, and my good friend Henry. &quot;He must be having fun at this very </span><span>moment&quot;, I thought. I really wanted to join him. But the strong winds took me to a small village on the Irish coast and something strange happened…</span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>IN THE PAST</strong><strong> – SMALL FISHING VILLAGE IN IRELAND</strong></span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Policeman<br /></span></strong><span>What a crowd! Come on. Come on, let me through. Let me through. Go home! Aren't you fishermen? Go fishing! Let the police do their duty!</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Viktor Frankenstein<br /></span></strong><span>What's going on?</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Policeman<br /></span></strong><span>You come with me, sir. You have to explain what happened to the man whose body we found. </span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Viktor Frankenstein<br /></span></strong><span>A body? Whose body? </span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Policeman<br /></span></strong><span>A body was found on the beach. The man had been killed. A fisherman says he saw a boat with a single man in it at a short distance from the beach. That boat looked like yours… We'll take you to see the body, Sir.</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>TODAY – IN THE ARCTIC</span></strong></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Viktor Frankenstein</span></strong></p> 
 <p><span>And so they did. &quot;<strong>Who lost their life</strong></span><span>?&quot; It was Henry! My best friend was killed! I was very upset and I can't remember much of what happened next. I'm told I had to be </span><span>carriedout</span><span> of the morgue. I had a fever and started saying that I was the murderer of William, Justine and Henry. I was arrested. When they found a letter from home in my pocket, they got in touch with my father in Geneva. He came to help me until I was allowed to go back home. </span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>IN THE PAST</strong><strong> – SMALL FISHING VILLAGE IN IRELAND</strong></span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Policeman<br /></span></strong><span>Well, Mr Alphonse Frankenstein, an important piece of information was brought to me. Your son was at the Orkney Islands at the hour the body of Mr Henry Clerval was found. Another fisherman saw him there. Take good care of this young man. He's been saying he's murdered someone called William, and Justine…</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Viktor Frankenstein's Father<br /></span></strong><span>He's sick. But we'll get back to Geneva where Elizabeth, his bride, is waiting for him. He'll get better.</span></p> 
 <p><span><strong>TODAY – </strong><strong>IN THE ARCTIC</strong></span></p> 
 <p><strong><span>Viktor Frankenstein<br /></span></strong><span>My father was very happy but I was not. Henry was certainly killed by the monster and <strong>who knew where this nightmare would end</strong></span><span>? Sometimes I thought I should tell my father about the Creature, but he might think I was mad. </span><strong><span>Who'd believe a Creature can be brought back</span></strong><span> </span><strong><span>from the dead? </span></strong><span>Would you? Nobody knew my life was under threat. The Creature could be watching me… I'll tell you about my arrival to Geneva and my meeting with Elizabeth next time. Would we really get married or would the monster kill again? I was afraid, very afraid…</span></p>

"<p><strong>TODAY - IN THE ARCTIC</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Hello. I'm scientist Viktor Frankenstein. You've been listening to the story the Creature told me long ago before I had to come after it and arrived here in the Arctic. The monster I built... I&nbsp;<strong>used to care&nbsp;</strong>about my science more than anything and I thought I could control nature. I've paid a high price for that. The Creature murdered my young brother and his nanny was executed for the crime. During that conversation years ago the monster told me he would go away and harm nobody else if I built him a bride. Should I do it? He wanted to have his answer when we sat by the fire in his hut in the mountains.</p> 
 <p><strong>IN THE PAST</strong><strong>&nbsp;- IN THE CREATURE'S HUT, SITTING BY THE FIRE</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>So, what do you say? If you give me a bride you'll never see or hear from me again.</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Alright. I'll do it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Will you?! That's great! Go home and start working. I'll watch your progress and when my bride is ready to come to life I'll be there.</p> 
 <p><strong>TODAY -&nbsp;</strong><strong>IN THE ARCTIC</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>For some reason I didn't want to start my work. I didn't want to do it in my father's house in Geneva, for sure. I didn't want him to find out about the monster. I was worried... and adding to that the monster had warned me he would watch me at a distance... My love, Elizabeth, noticed I wasn't happy.</p> 
 <p><strong>IN THE PAST</strong><strong>&nbsp;- AT THE FRANKENSTEIN HOME IN GENEVA</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Elizabeth<br clear=""none"" /></strong>You've been so quiet lately. We&nbsp;<strong>used to talk</strong>&nbsp;a lot. What's happening? Don't you like me anymore?</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Don't be silly! Of course I like you. I... I'll even keep the promise I made to my mother before she died, who was very fond of you. How about marriage? Will you marry me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Elizabeth<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Marriage?! Mr Frankenstein, did you hear what your son Viktor has just said? He asked me to marry him!</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein's Father<br clear=""none"" /></strong>That's fantastic news! My late wife and I&nbsp;<strong>used to watch</strong>&nbsp;you both playing together as children and we thought you were made for each other. You'll make a wonderful couple!</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Indeed, father. But first... well... I need to spend some time in England.</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein's Father<br clear=""none"" /></strong>England, my son?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Yes, father... there are some new scientific discoveries there which I must see for myself. And, well... this could be my last chance to travel and see the world before I settle down. We can have our wedding as soon as I come back, my dear Elizabeth.</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein's Father<br clear=""none"" /></strong>We understand, son. But well... you'll need a good friend to take care of you, won't you? I'll ask Henry, your best friend, to go with you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Henry?</p> 
 <p><strong>Elizabeth<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Yes. That's a great idea. Henry loves travelling and will surely agree to go!</p> 
 <p><strong>TODAY -&nbsp;</strong><strong>IN THE ARCTIC</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>My plan was to go to England and build a bride for the Creature. How could I keep my work a secret from Henry? We&nbsp;<strong>used to have</strong>&nbsp;fun travelling together but this time it was different. We stopped in many cities and when we reached Edinburgh I had to leave him behind...</p> 
 <p><strong>IN THE PAST</strong><strong>&nbsp;- AT A RESTAURANT IN EDINBURGH</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Henry<br clear=""none"" /></strong>That's a great restaurant, don't you think so?<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Yes. I suppose so.</p> 
 <p><strong>Henry<br clear=""none"" /></strong>What's going on with you, Viktor? I'm not used to seeing you this sad. What's the problem?</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>I think I need some time alone to think...</p> 
 <p><strong>Henry<br clear=""none"" /></strong>To think?</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Yes. I need to think about my life. Let's make a deal: I'll go away for a month or two on my own and when I'm back everything will be what it&nbsp;<strong>used to be</strong>: we'll have a lot of fun together! I promise!</p> 
 <p><strong>Henry<br clear=""none"" /></strong>OK. I'll be waiting for you.</p> 
 <p><strong>TODAY -&nbsp;</strong><strong>IN THE ARCTIC</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Well, I promised Henry a good time and the Creature a bride. I started collecting material and rented a hut far away in the Orkney Islands. But I had mixed feelings. It had been three years since I built the Creature and what a big mistake that was. What if the monsters didn't like each other? And if the female creature started killing people too? And... and if... if they had babies and there were hundreds of monsters!I couldn't allow this to happen! It was too dangerous. I hadn't finished the work yet but I couldn't give life to another monster. So I just destroyed it! It was over! No more bride. But what about the Creature? Was I going to pay a heavy price for destroying the female monster - the friend the monster was expecting to be happy with? I'll tell you next time.&nbsp;</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>IN THE CREATURE'S HUT, SITTING BY THE FIRE</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Hello, I'm the Creature. And I've been telling you and my creator, Viktor Frankenstein, about my experience meeting people. Some feared me, some hated me and finally I found a man who was kind to me... Well, he was blind and couldn't see my ugly face. But I hoped he might help me persuade others I'm good and loving... There I was, in his house, when his children arrived. What would they do when they saw me?</p> 
 <p><strong>IN THE PAST</strong><strong> - IN THE DELACEYS' HOME</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Girl<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Oh! What is that? Ohhhhhh...</p>

 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Ouch! Ouch! Please, please don't hurt me!</p> 
 <p><strong>Boy<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Out! Out!</p> 
 <p><strong>Father<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Son, what's going on?</p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Ouch! Arrrrrgh!</p> 
 <p><strong>IN THE CREATURE'S HUT, BY THE FIRE</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Oh that boy beat me with a stick! And he beat me and beat me! I could have killed him but... I just ran away. I was really angry! I wanted to be their best friend... But it was not going to happen. That's when I decided life is a war against man! Then I thought <strong>you, Dr Frankenstein, might be the only person </strong>to give me some answers. You, my creator!</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>How did you know where I lived?</p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Papers I took from your laboratory in Germany said you came from Geneva and that's where I was going! It took me two months to reach the place. One night I was ready to go to sleep when I heard the voice of a child...</p>

 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>The beautiful boy looked innocent and I thought <strong>he might accept</strong> my appearance. I decided that I would take him with me to be my friend. I wouldn't be lonely anymore. But when I caught him... well, I tried to tell him I wouldn't harm him.</p>

 <p><strong>IN THE CREATURE'S HUT, BY THE FIRE</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>That name <strong>took me by surprise</strong>! The name of my enemy! I felt so much hate... I put my hands around his neck and I held it. Yes, I held it tight and... suddenly I realised he went silent.</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>My brother William! My father is called Alphonse. Alphonse Frankenstein. And he doesn't even know about you!</p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>I knew this would make you suffer! You made me suffer and now I realised <strong>I could make you suffer too</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>And what happened to Justine, William's nanny, who was executed as his murderer?</p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>I found this lovely woman sleeping in a hut. I thought about waking her up but... I was sure she wouldn't be nice to me! She should suffer for that!</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>And what did you do?</p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>I put a locket with the picture of a woman I took from the boy's body in her pocket. My life is very sad and I made her pay for it!</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Horrible creature! You're responsible for the deaths of two good and innocent people!</p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>I told you, I was good too. But now I'm sad and alone! Nobody will ever love me... unless you create a woman - a monster like me - whom I can share my life with.</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Another monster like you? No!</p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>What I ask you is fair. If you give me another creature that looks like me, <strong>I could go </strong>and take it far away to South America. I'll make sure nobody will ever see us again.</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>No more contact with people?</p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>No. Never again.</p>

"<p><strong>IN THE CREATURE'S HUT, SITTING BY THE FIRE</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Hello, I'm... Viktor Frankenstein's Creature. Here we are, in my hut on the mountains. I'm happy to tell you and Viktor Frankenstein my story. How I learnt about the day, the night, the hunger, thirst, cold... And I learnt how to live with all this the hard way. Imagine that I tried to touch fire?! How silly of me. Of course I was burnt. But I saw good things too. These little creatures <strong>which made pleasant sounds</strong>. Yes, the birds. I tried to sound like them but nothing came out of my mouth! And I saw people. I've never learnt how to behave with you humans. I was surprised when people <strong>who saw me ran away</strong>. In the villages, some men wanted to hurt me.</p> 
 <p><strong>IN THE PAST</strong><strong> - IN THE VILLAGE</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Vigilante 1<br clear=""none"" /></strong>So do you all have things you can use as weapons with you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Crowd<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Yes!</p> 
 <p><strong>Boy<br clear=""none"" /></strong>I have a few stones <strong>that I can throw at the monster</strong>. I'm a good shot!</p> 
 <p><strong>Vigilante 1<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Go home, boy. The monster could be dangerous. It was seen trying to get into the house near the central square.</p> 
 <p><strong>Vigilante 2<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Shall we go and look for it? This time we might get lucky, catch it and kill it!</p> 
 <p><strong>Crowd<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Kill it! Kill the monster!</p> 
 <p><strong>Vigilante 1<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Let's go then. We can start near the vegetable garden <strong>where he was seen last time</strong>... Let's go!</p> 
 <p><strong>IN THE CREATURE'S HUT, BY THE FIRE</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>All these people seemed angry with me... Why?I escaped to the open country and hid in a hut. That was where I was when I watched a family in a nearby house. I heard they were called the De Laceys. I was careful not to allow them to see me. The boy, the girl and an old man looked poor but happy...</p> 
 <p><strong>IN THE PAST</strong><strong> - IN THE DE LACEYS' HOME</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Girl<br clear=""none"" /></strong>That's what we have for dinner today. Some carrots, potatoes, cheese, bread... just one egg. You like eggs, dad. This one is for you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Father<br clear=""none"" /></strong>You're very generous, dear daughter. But you should have this egg.</p> 
 <p><strong>Girl<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Maybe we should give it to my brother then. He's been working hard and he needs more food.</p> 
 <p><strong>Boy<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Thank you, sister. I'll try to work harder so that we can have more eggs to eat.</p> 
 <p><strong>Father<br clear=""none"" /></strong>I'm very grateful, son. A blind man's life isn't easy... The light in my life is the love of my children.</p> 
 <p><strong>IN THE CREATURE'S HUT, BY THE FIRE</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>They were so kind to one another... I wanted to be part of their family. I learned to speak by listening to them in hiding. I discovered books lost in the forest and learned how to read. And at that time I finally found out why people ran away from me. I saw my own face in a pond and... I'm really ugly! I didn't want to frighten this family. I had to find a way to talk to them. I thought about the father. He was blind and so he wouldn't see me. One day, using all my courage, I knocked at the door...</p> 
 <p><strong>IN THE PAST</strong><strong> - IN THE DELACEYS' HOME</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Father<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Who's there? Come in.</p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Please excuse me, Sir. I've been travelling and I was wondering if I could rest here for a while.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Father<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Sure. I can't see and my children, <strong>who take care of me</strong>, are not here at the moment, or I'd offer you some food.</p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Do not worry yourself, kind man. I'm looking for some friends and I fear these good people won't accept me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Father<br clear=""none"" /></strong>That's sad. But if these friends are good people, can't you persuade them to accept you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>I plan to start doing it now. But they believe that I want to harm them…</p> 
 <p><strong>Father<br clear=""none"" /></strong>You sound honest. I can try and help you. Who are your friends?</p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Oh, Sir. You are the first person <strong>who has been kind to me</strong>!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>BROTHER AND SISTER COME INTO THEIR HOME</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Father<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Just a minute... I can hear my children coming.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Oh, no! They'll see me! Please, take care of me good man! You and your family are the friends I want!</p> 
 <p><strong>Father<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Are we? Who are you?</p> 
 <p><strong>IN THE CREATURE'S HUT, BY THE FIRE</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>The door opened and there they were - the old man's two children. Did they kiss me? Did they run away? That's what I'm going to tell you next time.</p>

 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Hello. I'm Viktor Frankenstein. I've been telling you about how my young brother was murdered and his nanny was executed for the crime. But she was innocent! I felt guilty because I think the boy was killed by my creature. Yes, I've created the most evil creature on Earth! Nobody knew about it. I was so sad and lonely. I missed those days when I didn't worry so much. One morning I decided to go alone to the top of Montavert, where I had an unexpected meeting...</p> 
 <p><strong>IN THE PAST - ON TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Oh... this was a steep climb. But I finally reached the top... Oh, what a view! It's fantastic! The air is so fresh!&nbsp;<strong>I feel so much better now!</strong></p>

 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>It's you, monster!</p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>I came to talk to you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>I hate you! Don't you fear I might hurt you? Go away! If you stay here I'll kill you! I wish I could bring back the people you killed just by... just by killing you!</p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>I expected this welcome. Everybody hates me.&nbsp;<strong>You, my creator, hate me the most</strong>. But if you do your duty towards me, I'll do mine towards you and all the other people - all men and women.</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Duty?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Yes. I'll leave everybody in peace if you do one thing for me; but if you refuse, I'll kill your friends and family.</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Horrible monster! I will kill you first!</p> 
 <p><strong>FRANKENSTEIN TRIES TO ATTACK THE CREATURE</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Running from me, you coward? Come here. I'm gonna catch you!</p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Be calm! Haven't I suffered enough? My life is difficult but it's important to me and I'll fight for it.&nbsp;<strong>Remember that I am stronger than you</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Well, I have to admit that you are.</p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Oh Frankenstein, don't be like all the others who are hostile to me.&nbsp;<strong>Remember, that I'm your creature, and at the moment, the saddest creature of all</strong>. I see people happy everywhere. I feel rejected. I'm very lonely.</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Because you are disgusting!</p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>It's not my fault. I was good and had a kind heart; suffering made me bad. Make me happy, and I'll be good again.</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>What do you want me to do?</p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Follow me and hear my story.</p> 
 <p><strong>TODAY - IN THE ARCTIC</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>He led the way and I followed him. I kept thinking about what he had just said... Well... he had a point. I had created him. I was feeling sorry for him but I was also curious and... and wanted to know if he had really killed my brother. Maybe he didn't. We went into a hut. I sat by the fire to listen to his story. He looked happy to see me there.</p> 
 <p><strong>IN THE PAST - IN THE CREATURE'S HUT</strong>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Well.</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Well, here we are.</p> 
 <p><strong>Creature<br clear=""none"" /></strong>It's difficult for me to remember my first moments. I was so confused. Light hurt my eyes and I realised it was the sun. I was hungry and thirsty...</p> 
 <p><strong>TODAY - IN THE ARCTIC</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Yes, the Creature was like a child when I left it all alone in my laboratory. I ran away in fear when it woke up. Maybe I had a duty towards it. The Creature was left to find its way in the world for itself. It learnt how to survive in the forest, and... it had its first contact with man. How did it go? I'll let the Creature itself tell you all about it. That's what you'll hear next time...</p>

 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Hello, I'm scientist Viktor Frankenstein – well, I used to be a scientist but I came to hate everything about my job. I was back in the town where I was born, Geneva, after six years at university in Germany. I was brought back by bad news in my father's letter. I found him, and my sweet Elizabeth, very upset. My young brother William had been killed! How? By whom? The police were there too.</p> 
 <p><strong>IN THE PAST - AT THE FRANKENSTEIN FAMILY HOME</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Policeman<br clear=""none"" /></strong>We're doing everything we can to find who killed your son, Mr Alphonse Frankenstein.</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein's Father<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Thank you, detective.</p> 
 <p><strong>Policeman<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Miss Elizabeth, we're sorry about what happened to the boy: we know you're very close to the family.</p> 
 <p><strong>Elizabeth<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Yes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Policeman<br clear=""none"" /></strong>The marks of the killer's fingers that we found on the boy's neck were still fresh. The body was in the woods.</p> 
 <p><strong>Elizabeth<br clear=""none"" /></strong>That's horrible!</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein's Father<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Calm down, my dear Elizabeth. Sir, we were having a family day out and my son William disappeared.</p> 
 <p><strong>Policeman<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Very unfortunate, Mr Frankenstein. But<strong>&nbsp;we've just arrested&nbsp;</strong>a suspect.</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein's Father<br clear=""none"" /></strong>A suspect?! Who killed my boy?</p> 
 <p><strong>Policeman<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Well, we found a valuable locket with the boy's mother's picture in the pocket of one of the nanny's dresses.</p> 
 <p><strong>Elizabeth<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Justine?! It's not possible!</p> 
 <p><strong>Policeman<br clear=""none"" /></strong>I'm sorry, Miss Elizabeth.&nbsp;<strong>Justine hasn't explained yet&nbsp;</strong>how it got there! Was it stolen?</p> 
 <p><strong>Elizabeth<br clear=""none"" /></strong>But I know she's innocent!</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein's Father<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Elizabeth my dear, I want to believe that she's innocent, but what about the locket?</p> 
 <p><strong>Elizabeth<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Everyone believes Justine is guilty. I don't. She loved William very much.</p> 
 <p><strong>TODAY - IN THE ARCTIC</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Yes, everyone believed Justine had killed William - everyone except Elizabeth and I. Why? Because I knew who the murderer was. On my journey back to Geneva, I saw a very large figure run over the hills and disappear. It was the Creature! It was the murderer! And now, what would happen to poor Justine? She went to trial.</p> 
 <p><strong>IN THE PAST - IN THE COURTROOM</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Prosecutor<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Justine, you were out the whole night in which the child was killed, weren't you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Justine<br clear=""none"" /></strong><strong>I've already told&nbsp;</strong>the police and everybody else. I paid a visit to my auntie in the village. On my way back I heard people talking about a boy who went missing. It was William. I spent hours looking for him.</p> 
 <p><strong>Prosecutor<br clear=""none"" /></strong>A woman from the market saw you near the place where the child's body was found. What were you doing there?</p> 
 <p><strong>Justine<br clear=""none"" /></strong>I didn't know I was near the place.</p> 
 <p><strong>Prosecutor<br clear=""none"" /></strong>The woman asked you what you were doing there. She said you sounded confused.</p> 
 <p><strong>Justine<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Yes. I was tired and worried about William.</p> 
 <p><strong>Prosecutor<br clear=""none"" /></strong>You went back to the Frankenstein family home in the morning and asked to be told any news about the boy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Justine<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Yes!&nbsp;<strong>I've just told</strong>&nbsp;you, I was worried about him!</p> 
 <p><strong>Prosecutor<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Or maybe you felt guilty... When shown the body you started to scream!</p> 
 <p><strong>Justine<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Yes. It was horrible! Horrible!</p> 
 <p><strong>Prosecutor<br clear=""none"" /></strong>And you stayed in your bed for several days. That's when someone found this: the boy's locket with a picture of his mother - yes, this very locket - in your dress pocket. How do you explain that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Justine<br clear=""none"" /></strong>I... I... I can't explain!</p> 
 <p><strong>TODAY - IN THE ARCTIC</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Poor Justine! But I knew the monster had done something to make her look guilty... Our family was very rich and powerful. The crime was shocking. They had to find someone to blame quickly...</p>

 <p><strong>Judge<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Silence! For the murder of the child William Frankenstein on May, the 7th, I sentence Justine Moritz to death!</p> 
 <p><strong>TODAY - IN THE ARCTIC</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Justine was innocent but she was executed anyway. I felt that I was guilty of two deaths because I had created the monster!

 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Stupid man! Or was I the stupid one, the selfish one? I collected bones and flesh. I used bigger pieces because they were easier to work on and made me go faster. The creature was about 2.4 metres tall. It was ready on that rainy night in November...</p>

"<p><strong>TODAY - IN THE ARCTIC</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Hello I'm Viktor Frankenstein. I'm a scientist from Switzerland. You might ask how I arrived here, in the Arctic Circle. Yes, it's far from home. I came this far upon the ice. But it's very cold and I almost died. I was rescued by an explorer's boat. Captain Walton is a kind man but he's... He's ready to do anything to push the limits of science. He's a fool! And so are you if you try to fight Nature! Pardon me... I'm sick. It's freezing here. But I had to come and find the monster I've created! Did I ever think I would feel this way about a Creature I gave life to? No, I did not! Never!&nbsp;<strong>I created life and all my Creature has ever caused is death!&nbsp;</strong>How did I give life to the Creature? My love of science started early. I remember one morning when I was on holiday in France with my father...</p> 
 <p><strong>IN THE PAST - IN A FRENCH HOTEL</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein (13 years old)<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Look dad! Look!</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein's Father<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Reading a book? That's good my boy. It's been raining for hours. Staying indoors isn't good for a thirteen year old but it's lucky - you found an interesting book here at the hotel.</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein (13 years old)<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Yes. I'm not bored anymore.&nbsp;<strong>Actually, I've never read anything so good</strong>. This book is fantastic!</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein's Father<br clear=""none"" /></strong>What's it about? Let me see... Cornelius Agrippa! Oh, my dear Viktor, don't waste your time with this book. It's full of foolish ideas. Find another one.</p> 
 <p><strong>TODAY&nbsp;- IN THE ARCTIC</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>I had in my hands a book by an alchemist who lived in the 1500s. My father didn't explain to me that Agrippa's ideas were old and had no place in modern science. So I went on to read books by other alchemists. I thought about the power of magic all the time. I wanted to find the elixir of life! Could I ever end diseases and control death? These were my thoughts when I went to the University of Ingolstadt, in Germany. But when I arrived there I didn't expect my professors to laugh at me.<em>&nbsp;</em></p> 
 <p><strong>IN THE PAST -&nbsp;AT UNIVERSITY</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Professor&nbsp;</strong><strong>Krempe<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Have you really wasted your time studying these foolish ideas, young Frankenstein? Good God!</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein (17 years old)<br clear=""none"" /></strong>But Professor Krempe... I...</p> 
 <p><strong>Professor Krempe<br clear=""none"" /></strong><strong>Has n</strong><strong>obody ever told you these ideas are old and silly?</strong>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein (17 years old)<br clear=""none"" /></strong>Well, no...&nbsp;<strong>It's never been explained to me why</strong>. I... I...&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Professor&nbsp;</strong><strong>Krempe<br clear=""none"" /></strong>All is not lost, my dear sir. You must start again and study real science!&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>TODAY&nbsp;- IN THE ARCTIC</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>I didn't like Professor Krempe at all! And modern science wasn't as exciting to me as the science of the old alchemists. Those men wanted to discover things about power and how to live forever. Perhaps their ideas didn't work but they were fantastic! I was disappointed... but not for long. What got me excited again was one particular class. Professor Waldman didn't laugh at the old alchemists I loved so much. I felt he understood me. Later I paid him a visit. He opened my eyes to other subjects. I remember his words well...</p> 
 <p><strong>IN THE PAST -&nbsp;AT UNIVERSITY</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Professor&nbsp;</strong><strong>Waldman<br clear=""none"" /></strong>If your wish is to become a real man of science, you must study everything, including chemistry and mathematics.</p> 
 <p><strong>TODAY&nbsp;- IN THE ARCTIC</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Viktor Frankenstein<br clear=""none"" /></strong>I built my own laboratory in the room at the top of my house. And I studied hard. At the end of two years I even made some discoveries in chemistry. The other professors at the university were pleased. My father wrote me letters. He sent news about my young brothers and my childhood love Elizabeth but... I didn't give them much thought. I started to study anatomy and all I could think about was creating life! And I succeeded - unfortunately! And I'll tell you about how I gave life to the Creature next time.</p>

 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>Well,&nbsp;<strong>don't get your hopes up</strong>. This place has been&nbsp;<strong>on its knees</strong>&nbsp;ever since it opened. We've all had a laugh but I need to get a job at a proper restaurant, where the customers are queuing up to eat my food.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Don't<strong>&nbsp;pin your hopes on it</strong>. It was your cooking that scared the customers away anyway. Hang on, did I just hear somebody come in?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>I'll go and check.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br /><strong>To be honest</strong>, I might be able to take you with me, to my new job - but Peter - not a chance.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I can only&nbsp;<strong>live in hope</strong>!</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>Yes, we've got two customers! And they want... a cheese and tomato pizza. Can we do pizzas?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Can we do pizzas?&nbsp;<strong>Not a hope in hell!&nbsp;</strong>Do I look like a chef who cooks 'pizzas'?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Come on Gordon. We're&nbsp;<strong>pinning our hopes</strong>&nbsp;on keeping these customers... you do know how to cook a pizza don't you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>Yes... well... it's just a little bit beneath me... but I suppose I can give it a go.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Good. I'll tell Ceilia the good news.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Peter. Here's &pound;10 - run to the supermarket and buy some frozen pizzas. But shhh, it's our little secret.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>OK.</p> 
 <p><strong>10 MINUTES LATER</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>Mmmm, something smells good. Great news about getting all the customers in - even though they only like pizza! It seems like there's&nbsp;<strong>a glimmer of hope</strong>&nbsp;for the business.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Looking good. Maybe pizzas are our future?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>Yes, they're not bad for frozen pizzas are they?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>Frozen?! Oh you've&nbsp;<strong>dashed my hopes</strong>. This is&nbsp;<strong>the last straw</strong>... I'm going to have to find a&nbsp;<em>real</em>&nbsp;chef... and not one that is as arrogant as you!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>But what am I going to do? I can't just get a new job just like that.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>There might not be hope for you but I think I might have the perfect answer.</p> 
 <p><strong>LATER...</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />How's your new job Gordon? Can I borrow your hat? Thank you!</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>So I was at the bus stop but&nbsp;then I decided to walk, but these shoes -&nbsp;they're just not designed for... oh, what's this?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Goodness. It looks like Gordon has finally&nbsp;<strong>pulled out all&nbsp; of the stops</strong>&nbsp;and actually made something amazing!</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />It must be the bake-off competition - always makes an effort when there's something to win! The first prize is &pound;500.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Hi Gordon. Fantastic cake.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>Cake? What cake?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>This one. Did you make it for the competition?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>The bake-off. The first prize is &pound;500.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Oh... the competition... yes, that's my cake. It's rather good isn't it? Yes, I think the attention to detail will put me&nbsp;<strong>ahead of the game</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>It is amazing how much effort you can put in when there's big money&nbsp;<strong>up for grabs</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>It's not about the money, Ceilia, but this should really&nbsp;<strong>blow the competition away.<br /></strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />But don't forget you'll be&nbsp;<strong>in competition with</strong>&nbsp;some of the best bakers in the business.<br /><br /><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Don't worry about that. I had better just go and put this in a box so we can send it off to the judges - we don't want to miss the deadline.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary&nbsp;</strong><br /><strong>May the best man win!</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Best man? Is someone getting married?<br /><br /><strong>Mary<br /></strong>No, I was just wishing him luck for the bake-off competition.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>Oh is he entering too? I've been baking all night to make a cake for the competition. I put it over... here.&nbsp;Has anyone seen my cake?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>Was it a chocolate cake with a cream top?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong>&nbsp;<br />Yes!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Gordon, I think you've got Peter's cake.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>Yes... I was going to help him deliver it. There you go Peter, and - nice cake, probably needs a little bit more cream.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Thank you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br />You win some, you lose some</strong>. And this time you&nbsp;<em>definitely</em>&nbsp;lost!</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Thanks for your attention everyone. Now, as you know, I attended a conference yesterday and one of the great ideas I learnt was giving members of staff the opportunity to experience what other members of staff do.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />You mean a job swap?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />So one of you lot is going to try doing my job?! Impossible!</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />I want you to see what it feels like <strong>to be in someone else's shoes</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />But I wouldn't fit in your shoes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Not literally Peter. It's just to understand what other people do – I'll take your job and you can take mine. And Mary and Gordon you can swap jobs too. Now, I'll take some orders – can I have your notepad please Peter?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Oh very well... actually, <strong>from where I'm standing</strong>, it seems like I've got the easy job!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />We'll see about that.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />So everyone back to work please. Come on Gordon, we need all these plates washed.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />I have an order - Four Seasons Vegetable Ragout for two people.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />OK, coming right up. Gordon – I'll need some large bowls washing... and I'll need that pan... come on, quick as you can.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br /><strong>I hear you</strong>! I just can't believe I've got to do all this.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Well done Mary... you're doing a great job.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Actually... can you <strong>spare me a thought</strong>... I've got to do all this.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Hmm, <strong>I can see where you're coming from</strong>. You can't cope... you're fired. Off you go.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />You can't do that!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Peter! <strong>Take some pity on him</strong> – he's after all only a washer-upper!</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />So how's the job swap going?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />He's sacked me!</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Well done. I've been trying to do that for months! How's it going for you Mary?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />It's all fine. All the food's ready to go. I don't know why Gordon makes such a fuss about cooking!</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Nor do I. But you see in my job, I have to show <strong>empathy</strong> for people. So Gordon – you can stay... for now.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Mary<br /> </strong>It's quiet without Gordon today.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>It's nice isn't it! He said he was going for a fitting but I'm not sure what for though. Ahh, here he comes now.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Good morning Gordon. Bad hair day?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>Excuse me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>Keep your hair on! Don't forget we've got some students coming in for lunch today so none of your <strong>old-fashioned</strong> dishes… give them something contemporary – modern.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>Leave it to me. I'm<strong> down with the kids.</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>You've got it <em>covered</em>?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>Yes I have… oh I see, you're referring to this… my new toupee… my wig. I'm just keeping up with the fashion.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>And what fashion is that then?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>A new hair style – these are <strong>all the rage</strong> – the women love it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br /> <strong>After a fashion</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>I thought that wigs were a bit… <strong>old hat</strong>. And if you are going to cook in that, then wear it <em>under </em>this hat, for now</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>I knew you two couldn't handle my new<strong> fashion statement</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>You're being <strong>a fashion victim</strong> – we liked the old you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>Well you're stuck with the new me now. Just leave me to cook!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Ooops, looks like you've made <strong>a fashion faux pas</strong>…</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>… there appears to be hair in the soup!</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>Hair in the soup? Keep your voice down… everyone will want one.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Right, gather round everybody. I want you to try my new recipe. Ostrich lasagne.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>Ostrich?! As in the very tall bird?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>Yes, and a very healthy and lean meat to eat. Now, would you like to try some or is it too sophisticated for you Peter?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />No - I'd love to try some. Mmm delicious. Very... ostrichy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Tastes a bit like chicken.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Yes... something of an after taste... it's a bit like... mouldy cheese.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />I am&nbsp;<strong>sick to death</strong>&nbsp;of your comments Ceilia. I'm trying to create a new menu - as you asked me to.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Ooh, sorry, I feel a bit&nbsp;<strong>off colour</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Gordon, that's not a good sign.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong>&nbsp;<br />Actually, I feel a bit&nbsp;<strong>queasy</strong>... sorry Gordon, something's not quite right.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>Is this some kind of&nbsp;<strong>sick joke</strong>?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />No sick joke Gordon... errr... I need to dash.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon&nbsp;</strong><br />Typical!&nbsp;<strong>I'm sick of this</strong>... I try to make them something new and they just make a fuss. It smells alright to me.</p> 
 <p><strong>FROM THE RESTAURANT<br /></strong>Waiter! Waiter!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>Alright, keep your hair on, we'll be there in a minute. Look at this kitchen, now I've got to cook, clean and serve. Honestly, you wouldn't get this at The Poison Ivy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>Something in that made me&nbsp;<strong>as sick as a dog</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Well, I'm&nbsp;<strong>as sick as a parrot</strong>&nbsp;- I've been preparing this all morning.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Parrot? Did you put parrot in&nbsp;<em>instead</em>&nbsp;of ostrich?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>No he didn't Peter... it was certainly ostrich... look, it's a week out of date.</p> 
 <p><strong>FROM THE RESTAURANT<br /></strong>Waiter! Waiter!</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>Listen everyone. I've just heard on the radio, the police are looking for a criminal who was last seen in this area. We need to keep an eye out for him.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>Oh no - you don't think he might come here do you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon&nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh yes, no doubt he'll have a three-course meal while he waits for the police to catch him.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Not if he's eating your cooking Gordon. Anyway Ceilia, what does he look like?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Well, the police say he's about Gordon's height, he's got a slightly reddish face and is wearing a silly hat...</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>Well, don't all look at me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>... and he's got glasses and he also has a moustache.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />A moustache! Sounds like a&nbsp;<em>proper</em>&nbsp;criminal... he no doubt slits the throats of his victims... killed his mother... and doesn't pay his taxes. When I see him I'll make sure he gets his<strong>&nbsp;comeuppance</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />You're&nbsp;<strong>all mouth and no trousers</strong>&nbsp;Gordon. Anyway, everyone back to work and remember we need to keep an eye out for him.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Are you a bit nervous Gordon?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>No. I've had to deal with customers that are worse than criminals.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>The... the... the man... I think he's out there... table 3.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />OK, stay calm. Peter, go get Ceilia. Gordon... go and see if he's out there. Come on - are you&nbsp;<strong>a man or a mouse</strong>?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />He might have a knife or a gun... he could be dangerous...</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Come on...&nbsp;<strong>what are you made of?</strong>&nbsp;I thought you were&nbsp;<strong>my knight in shining armour!</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>I'll see if it's him. False alarm! It's not him!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>Right, I'm going out there. How dare we have customers in here trying to look like dangerous criminals... I was that close to handing him over to the police.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>Don't bother. When did I say he was a dangerous criminal? The police are looking for a thief who was shoplifting.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Hmmm, I think it's safer if you stay in the kitchen Gordon!</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>Is that wise? It's his cooking that's criminal!</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />How are you today, Peter?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Very good thank you… Actually not very good – thank you for asking.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Why? What's the matter?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Last night, I was walking home when I crossed the road and I was almost hit by a burger van.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Oh no, Peter, that's terrible. Are you OK?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Just a bit shaken. He was going so fast!</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Why don't you come and sit down in the office until you feel a bit better.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />OK</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Sorry I'm late – I had some extra-curricular activities. To be honest, I overslept – I've been working late doing another job.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />You're moonlighting Gordon? Do you really need a second job?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />This is not any old job, sweetheart – this is an opportunity to manage a high-class American-themed restaurant. This is my future!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Are you sure?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />God's honest truth!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Hmm really. Look, I think you should tell Ceilia – to avoid any problems – honesty is the best policy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />No no, I don't think we should tell her. Let's keep it our little secret. Anyway, I don't want her thinking I'm just working here out of sympathy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />No, of course not. Anyway, where is this 'high-class' restaurant?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Oh, well, you wouldn't know where it is.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Try me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Well, it's currently parked… I mean located… on Canal Street, near the park.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />That's where I was almost hit by that burger van. Look, I've got a photo of the van on my phone.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />That's strange – that van's parked outside our restaurant. Maybe I ought to call the police?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Let's not be too hasty. I'm sure there's a simple explanation.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Yes… I think there might be. Gordon, you may as well come clean. This high-class restaurant you're managing – it's a burger van, isn't it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />What's that Gordon? Flipping burgers in your spare time? How would you like to flip burgers full-time instead of working here?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Let's not be too hasty. I'm just trying to make an honest living.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Well, if you're a decent and honest man, why don't you compensate Peter for the stress that you've caused him?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Thank you!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Now everything is open and above board – perhaps we could book a table at your 'restaurant' tonight?!</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Phew, what a night!</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>Yes, amazing. I've never done anything like <em>that</em> before.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Nor I. My first ever awards ceremony.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong><strong>I didn't</strong> <strong>sleep a wink</strong> when I got home. I was still buzzing from meeting all those celebrity chefs.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>'Didn't sleep a wink' did you say Peter? I <strong>slept like a log </strong>– celebrity chefs don't excite me. They may be famous but can they cook?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Well, they certainly win a lot of awards.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>Yes – The Poison Ivy won 'Restaurant of the Year' – it's a shame we didn't win any awards though.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>Yes, well <strong>I wouldn't lose too much sleep over it</strong> – what is an award anyway but just a piece of metal that sits on the shelf gathering dust. A real award is a customer thanking me for an excellent meal.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter&nbsp;<br /></strong>Really? I thought you said getting an award would be the highlight of your career?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Peter, I think it's best if we <strong>let sleeping dogs lie</strong> – you know how sensitive he is.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>Now where's my <strong>sleeping partner</strong>?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>I hope you didn't mean me – I'm the only boss here. Sorry I'm late, I had a bit too much champagne last night - but at least <strong>I slept like a baby</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Lucky you. Peter and I may need <strong>a catnap</strong> later!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>You've got no stamina – honestly! You two left earlier than me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br /> Well, that's because you kept putting your arm around me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>Did he indeed?! Well, after that woman on the dance floor slapped you round the face and <em>you</em> left… the judges gave out another award.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon&nbsp;<br /></strong>Another award – really?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>Yes – and guess what? We won it!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon&nbsp;<br /></strong>At last – some recognition – my true talents are there in writing to be seen – come on then Peter, what does it say?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>'Gordon Grater – Most Arrogant Chef' – oh, congratulations!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oh Gordon – it looks like you need some <strong>beauty sleep</strong>!</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>This is all very exciting. Everybody wants the sushi...</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>That's because tonight is our special 'Sushi Night', idiot - a chance for me to cook something really special for people with appreciation of real exotic food.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>It's raw fish isn't it Gordon? No cooking required.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>Sounds like&nbsp;<strong>a recipe for disaster</strong>. Well, at least you can't burn it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />You wouldn't understand. The only fish you eat is deep fried with chips. Now out of the way.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>Oh dear! Let's just put them on the plate shall we... no one will notice.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />I'll help you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />It's ruined now. Why don't you go and do some waiting while I work out what to do next?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>How's our 'Sushi Night' coming on - got everything under control Gordon?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>No - we're&nbsp;<strong>up the creek without a paddle</strong>! Peter has just made me drop my sushi and I've got no more sushi rice - I can't make any more. &nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>Oh dear, is our Sushi Night&nbsp;<strong>on</strong>&nbsp;<strong>the brink of disaster</strong>?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon&nbsp;</strong><br />I need more sushi rice - I'm going to have to go and buy some - you wouldn't know what to get. Mary why don't you entertain the customers by reading your... philosophy thesis?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Hang on Ceilia, isn't this the rice Gordon was using?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>I think so.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>OK, leave it to me.</p> 
 <p><strong>CAPTION: 10 MINUTES LATER</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />I've told him before, if he does this again... what kind of Asian supermarket doesn't sell sushi rice?! This whole evening is a disaster... oh... Where'd you get that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong><strong>Disaster averted</strong>! Mary made these and saved the day again. Peter!</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Yes?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Can you take these out to the customers and apologise for the delay?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />That was&nbsp;<strong>a close shave</strong>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>Yes, good thing I always make a point of having some spare ingredients.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>Can I have word with you all, please?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>What's the matter Ceilia? You look worried.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>I am. That was the council. They're sending a health inspector here to check the kitchen out.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>Really! Well there's nothing to worry about where I'm concerned. I think you'll find everything over here is&nbsp;<strong>spick and span</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>It's your&nbsp;<strong>personal hygiene</strong>&nbsp;I'd be worried about, Gordon!</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>What time is this health inspector coming?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>Don't know. It's a spot check – it could happen at any time. So, let's get to work. I want this place&nbsp;<strong>as clean as a whistle</strong>. There's a layer of grease on that bit. And on that bit.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>There you go –&nbsp;<strong>spotless</strong>!&nbsp;<strong>You could eat your dinner off that</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Why would you eat your dinner off the cooker when we've got plates?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Look, Gordon – are you going to help us clean the rest of the kitchen?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>Why? I didn't make that area dirty.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>If we don't get&nbsp;<strong>a clean bill of health</strong>, the council could shut us down.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Ahh, yes, then I could work in a proper restaurant where the chefs&nbsp;<em>cook</em>&nbsp;and the cleaners&nbsp;<em>clean</em>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>A car's just pulled up – it could be the health inspector.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Well, we've done our best Ceilia – under the circumstances.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />&nbsp;Hmm... doesn't look too bad... oh!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>Ah... yes, well... I can explain...</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Gordon, looks like you need to&nbsp;<strong>clean your act up</strong>!</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Well said, Mary. Shall we start with&nbsp;<strong>a clean slate</strong>? Quickly!</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Have I ever told you that I used to work in a top restaurant in New York?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />No, you haven't</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />He was flipping burgers in a fast food joint.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />We have some customers from America!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Amazing! America. Americans always appreciate good food… like mine. Well, what do they want?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />The lady just wants a tuna salad but the gentleman doesn't like anything on the menu and says can you knock up some 'jambalaya' and maybe some 'key lime pie' for pudding?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Yes… of course… anything for our American cousins.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />I'll go and tell them you'd be happy to do it then.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Good job you worked in America Gordon, we'd hate the customers to get the better of you!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />It's alright Mary, I know what I'm doing. Now jambalaya… where's the jam?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Would you like us to Google the recipe? We wouldn't want you to fall at the first hurdle.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />No it's OK. I just need some potatoes…</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Look, why don't we just cut our loses and I'll go and tell the customers you haven't a clue what you're cooking.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />No, just tell them that we're out of 'balaya' and the 'key' for the key lime pie is locked in the cupboard.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Oh dear Gordon. I can see why you left New York.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />I can't be excellent at everything.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Let me Google it for you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />They've decided to leave.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />You made a right pig's ear of that haven't you Gordon? Do you know how to cook a pig's ear?! What's wrong Gordon - you got a sense of humour failure?!</p>

"<p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Oh! Who left this box of chocolates here?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Who are they for?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Well, you must have a secret admirer… it's got you name on it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Oh I love chocolate to bits.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Do you know who they're from?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Oh, they'll be from Peter… he's always buying me little gifts.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />That's very sweet. Has he got the hots for you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />No, he's just pleased to have a friend. Ssshh, here he comes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />There it is…</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Everything OK Gordon?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Yes of course. Why do you have to keep asking that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />There's no love lost between you two!</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Yes, well it's a love-hate relationship. More hate than love!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Actually, it's this chocolate souffle I'm making. I can't seem to get the right type of milk chocolate for love nor money.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Oh… would you like to use one of these?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Yes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Gordon! I said just use one. These were a present.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />I know… I mean… cooking is a labour of love and sometimes I get carried away.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Oh Peter. I'm so sorry. The chocolates you bought for me… Gordon's just used them all in the souffl&eacute;.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Chocolates? I didn't buy you any chocolates Mary – why would I do that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Then who were they from?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Ooo, I love a good mystery.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Do you know who we've got in the restaurant tonight?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />A customer?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Well yes… it's a VIP…</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />A 'V-I-P'… what's that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />A Very Important Person – it's the town mayor. I can't believe that he's decided to eat in our restaurant tonight.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Yes, that's the type of top-notch customer I like to cook for. Royalty!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Well he's not royalty Gordon, but he is an important person so I'm going to give this plate an extra polish.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />There's the order Gordon. He wants champagne too… I'll go and get some.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />I hope you've sobered up after last week and I hope you're going to pull out all the stops to make an excellent dish.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Excellence is what I excel at Ceilia, you know that. Right let's get to work… wow, he wants the steak surprise. I can tell this is a man with first-class taste.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Oh just get on with it Gordon.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />There finished – perfect! Peter!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Well done Gordon… you really have gone above and beyond your usual standards.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Peter, I want you to take this to the mayor. Any bad view he has of our restaurant will be blown right out of the water when he tastes that food.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Well, what did he say?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />He said we had 'exceeded his expectations'.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Good, good.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Yes… we are even worse than he had expected. And also, he is a vegetarian and has never eaten meat.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />But this order said steak surprise…</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />That one does… but this says mushroom risotto.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Excellent!</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>Something smells nice.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Ah, that'll be my 'coq au vin' – I've created a superior dish to attract a better type of customer.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />It's about time you did. I'm glad that we actually have got a customer, so make it snappy otherwise they'll escape.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Ceilia, it can take all the time in the world to make something as special as this. Now, one for the pot… and one for me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Customer on table four says they haven't got all day, so hurry up.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Give them this to keep them sweet.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />I'll take that thank you… for the food of course.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Come on Gordon, every second counts. Oh, thank goodness you're here Mary. Just in the nick of time. I think I'm going to need your help.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Ah, lovely Mary… did I ever tell you, I love those rubbery gloves?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />There's a customer out there who's waiting for his food and Gordon is in no fit state to cook.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Mary, have you tried my coq au vin?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Hmm, right. Leave this to me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />The customer's not happy… he says he's only going to wait for five more minutes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />It's a race against time. Mary, can you do it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />You smell lovely.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Made it – with seconds to spare!</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />That was a close one.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Smells delicious… that's better!</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Mary, could you pass me that pan there please?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Yes… of course.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />You've got no customers to serve, Peter?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />No… nobody.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />It's probably the calm before the storm!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />If by that you mean it's going to get busy later, I very much doubt it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Thanks for your vote of confidence Gordon.</p> 
 <p>[The phone rings]</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />I'll get that, shall I? &quot;The White Elephant… how can I help you? Ok… yes… at 8 o'clock? Ok… We'll see you then.&quot; People… customers… now!</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Well that's good news isn't it? How many are coming?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Twenty-five! In a bus! In&nbsp;one hour!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />That's impossible. How can I cook for 25 people? I do quality, not quantity.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Keep your cool, Gordon. This is our big moment.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Our big moment? It'll be our big failure. Why did you say 'yes' Peter?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Stay calm! We can do this but you're going to need to let me help you. I'll chop some vegetables and prepare some starters.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />But how I am going to write down 25 orders? I've only got a small pad.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Well done Mary. See, she's got it all under control.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Under control! Chopping some carrots will not feed 25 people!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />My advice Gordon is to act cool and collected and everything will be ok.</p> 
 <p>[Phone rings again]</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Somebody answer that phone, I'm going to get some onions.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />I'm on it. &quot;Hello… The White Elephant… oh yes… yes… I see… I hope you get it fixed… thanks for letting us know. Bye&quot;. That was people from the bus… they've broken down and won't be able to come tonight.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Oh no, that's a shame. We'd better tell Gordon before he blows a gasket!</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Hmmm… let's not tell him straight away!</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Oh… you've got&nbsp;<strong>a face like a wet weekend</strong>. Keep it down will you, I'm trying to cook here.</p> 
 <p>Ceilia, it's Peter – he's&nbsp;<strong>feeling blue</strong>, sort him out will you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Oh Peter, you seem&nbsp;<strong>down in the dumps</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Yes, it's Edith… She's dead.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Who's Edith?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />I'm not sure… but I think it's his mother.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Sorry old chap. That's terrible news. I understand why you're so&nbsp;<strong>downhearted</strong>. Were you close to Edith?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Yes. I'd talk to her every day and watch her go round and round. She was a great swimmer.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Oh. Don't&nbsp;<strong>cry your eyes out</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Worse things happen at sea</strong>. Shall I get you a glass of wine?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />This must be a very upsetting time for you. Would you like some time off?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />What's going on? Is Peter ok?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />It's Peter - his mother's died. He's&nbsp;<strong>beside himself with grief</strong>. I've given him a glass of wine.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Edith! Edith!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Edith? Did he just say Edith?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Yes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Edith is the name of his pet goldfish. Peter, has your goldfish died?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Yes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Great! You've got a dead fish, I could use it in my fish pie.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Gordon!</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />So, we need to talk about the restaurant. As you know business isn't great so I'm looking for some good ideas to make us more efficient and help us save money. Please have a think and let me know.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />It's obvious. Peter,&nbsp;we'll have to let you&nbsp;go. Mary, you&nbsp;can serve the food AND wash up afterwards.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Hold on Gordon. That's not fair. Peter's a hardworking waiter. And besides, I've got too much to do here. No, we need to think 'out of the box', so to speak.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Yes, good idea Mary… Sorry, what box?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />It means we need to think a bit differently, not just assume we need to cut people's jobs.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Come on then clever clogs, what are we going to do? Get cheaper ingredients, turn the gas down a bit?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />I know, we can stop putting salt and pepper on the table – nobody uses it anyway.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />What a brainwave – we'll save millions! You idiot.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Oh, I know! We could buy organic ingredients and charge a bit extra for them – plus we could offer a set menu to attract new customers and hopefully they'll tell their friends about how great it is here.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Yes! It's the best idea since sliced bread!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Is it? Sliced bread's the only thing we'll be serving with that ridiculous idea. Mary, you're too clever by half. Organic food, honestly, it's so 'last year'.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Have you got any better suggestions Gordon?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Ceilia… Mary's come up with a great idea. Organic set menu and…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Right, we offer a set menu, to attract new customers, serving organic food that we charge a bit extra for.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />That's a great idea Mary. I knew you were a smart cookie when I employed you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />But… but… I'm going to have to change suppliers and come up with new stuff for the set menu. How is that a clever idea?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Well, extra customers means extra money and that means an extra bonus for us all at the end of the year.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Oh well… yes… organic food – that is a very clever idea of mine. I'll just go and make some calls, shall I?</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Oh dear, oh dear.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Problem Ceilia?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Well according to my calculations, in the past two months we've only had 22 customers. I'm not sure we can afford to stay in business.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Well you gave it your best shot but maybe it's time to say enough is enough – and give up. No doubt I'll get a new job at some high-class restaurant.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Oh be quiet Gordon and let me think.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />I knew she couldn't cope. She calls herself a business woman but really I'm the brains behind this business.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Really?! Actually, I think she's a tough cookie – and she doesn't strike me as the sort of person to give up easily.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Ha! Don't forget I used to be married to her. You might seem as tough as old boots but she wouldn't say boo to a goose. She's as soft as a little kitten…</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Excuse me… you're the one who cried all the way through the royal wedding on TV! Believe me Gordon, I'm a game old bird and I've decided to make some changes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Oh… right Ceilia. Let's hear them then.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>Right. Well firstly, I think we ought to extend the menu and offer more choices.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />That's impossible.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Well maybe for you… perhaps we ought to think about staffing then?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />You're relentless.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />And what is the second point Ceilia?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Well secondly, I think we ought to open earlier and try to get more customers in for lunchtime.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Working longer hours you mean!</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Well tough luck Gordon. You might think that I'm as gentle as a kitten but I'm as hard as nails and believe me I'm not going to give up on this business yet. So go on, think of something new for the menu.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Aww, tough love Gordon! Do you want the recipe book?</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Thanks for coming in earlier than normal. I wanted to give the kitchen a good spring clean. Hopefully the others will be here soon to help.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />No problem - although it was a bit of a shock to the system getting up this early!</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />What on earth was that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />I heard it too. Hang on, I'm just going to go and put the lights on. Oh, it's Gordon! He gave me the shock of my life.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Gordon? What's he doing sleeping here in the kitchen?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Oh… err… hello Ceilia, hello Mary. I was just err…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />… sleeping on the floor. Gordon, you made me jump out of my skin.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Sorry about that. I was just checking the… cooker connections.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Sleeping more like. The last time I saw you looking this bad was when you came back drunk from that party and I kicked you out.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Well… errr… I've been kicked out again. It happened out of the blue. I came home last night and my girlfriend… my new girlfriend… my new ex-girlfriend, she said she was sick of me coming home late and stinking of fried food.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Yes, so I can smell.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>Gordon, I'm stunned. I thought your girlfriend had no taste but now I can see she has!</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>Sorry I'm late. Oh, what's that smell?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />It's Gordon. He's been kicked out of his house and he's been sleeping here. Hang on a minute Peter - don't you have space at your house?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Yes I have.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Could Gordon stay with you until he sorts himself out?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />What a great idea Mary. I'd love a bit of company. You can sleep on the sofa. Is that OK?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />That's great! Gordon the great chef sleeping on the sofa of the little waiter. Sounds perfect! But you're going to have to get some earplugs, Peter.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Why?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Well - he snores!</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Table&nbsp;two weren't too keen on the soup. Ooh, what's that? A letter from a secret admirer?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />no. Nothing like that – it's my exam results…</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Exam results? I didn't know you'd been studying.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Yes – I've been studying for a PhD – and it says here, I'm a doctor!</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Oh well done Mary – Doctor Marigold - another feather in your cap. You're so clever.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />What's that? You've qualified to be a 'doctor'. Well done… although personally I think the world needs more chefs than doctors – everybody needs to eat. But well done… you've had a lucky break.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Yes, you're going to be a real success, maybe you'll be my doctor…</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Of course, I know all about success. I've got a track record for creating world-class food and winning numerous awards – just ask Ceilia.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />So what's the secret to your success Gordon?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Well… errr… an appreciation for food… an eye for detail… and an excellent relationship with the customers.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Are you sure?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Yes! Now I want you to take this to table two… it's one of my best recipes… it's always a roaring success.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Hmm… don't count your chickens before they've hatched.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Don't worry Mary. I can taste success. You wouldn't find a doctor making something like this.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Well, they're certainly eating it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />There you see… that's why I'm top dog in this kitchen.</p> 
 <p><strong>[CUSTOMER CALLS FROM RESTAURANT: Waiter! Waiter! Come quickly!]</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Oh no! One of the customers is lying on the floor being sick. I think he's got food poisoning!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Oh typical! Well come on then, you're a doctor.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />A Doctor of Philosophy, Gordon. But I'll see what I can do as per usual.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>That's it...&nbsp;<strong>I've had it up to here</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Gordon, you seem angrier than normal?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />How can I work in these conditions? With stuff everywhere and the noise -&nbsp;<strong>it is driving me up the wall</strong>! Why can't I work in a&nbsp;<em>professional</em>&nbsp;kitchen like I used to?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>Because you got the sack.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>We had creative differences that's all.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />OK, OK... but&nbsp;<strong>don't blow a fuse</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>Anyway I'm&nbsp;<strong>fed up to the back teeth</strong>&nbsp;with it, I've had enough.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Oh, he's&nbsp;<strong>like a bear with a sore head</strong>!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Yes he does seem to be&nbsp;<strong>at the end of his tether</strong>. Ceilia, have you got anybody else who can do the cooking tonight?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />No! The stand-by chef has got shingles. We can't be open today without a chef.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />I could have a go - I cooked a pizza once - although it was a frozen one from the supermarket.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />It's OK Peter, I'll go and talk to him.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>I'm sorry for&nbsp;<strong>losing it</strong>. I just wanted to let you know how I felt.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />We understand... OK are you ready to start preparing food?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>Yes, of course. I'm going to make one of my special beef Wellingtons.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>What did you say to him?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I just told him that a very important food critic had booked a table here tonight and might be writing about his food.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />But we don't have any reservations tonight do we?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />He doesn't need to know that!</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>Hi Peter - how's everything? Still enjoying working here?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Oh yes. It's a great restaurant. I love it here.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia&nbsp;</strong><br />Good, good... do you want to know a secret?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Oh... go on then.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />I can't tell anyone... but I've just entered us into the Restaurant of the Year awards - in the best newcomer category - hopefully, we'll be nominated!<br /><br /><strong>Peter</strong><br />Oh that's great news... well done!</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br /><strong>Mum's the word</strong>&nbsp;- I can't tell anyone until it's officially announced.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br /><strong>My lips are sealed</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />See you Ceilia... What are you smirking at?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Nothing... Oh go on then. Ceilia's just told me a big secret...</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>What?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>We've been nominated for Restaurant of the Year award! But&nbsp;<strong>keep it under wraps</strong>&nbsp;hey?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />No way! Gosh, Restaurant of the Year... me, a winner!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Have you won something Gordon?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>No, no... you'll probably find out anyway...&nbsp;<strong>a little dickie bird just told me</strong>&nbsp;that I've won the Restaurant of the Year award! But ssshhh,&nbsp;<strong>keep it to yourself</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>OK, I won't&nbsp;<strong>let the cat out of the bag</strong>... except there's no cat to let out. The awards aren't for another six months - we can't have won.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>She's right Gordon. I've only just put the entry form in... What's up? Cat got your tongue?!</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>Mary,&nbsp;<strong>today is your lucky day</strong>!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Oh really Gordon, why's that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />I have made a fabulous meal using just one large pan. So not much washing-up for you!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Oh, lucky me!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Yes and it's nearly ready - just&nbsp;<strong>one more chilli for luck</strong>. Peter!</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>Yes Mr Gordon... you called?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />I want you to take that pan to table 3 and watch their&nbsp;<strong>faces light up with amazement</strong>. Be careful!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Do you want a hand?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />It's OK Mary, leave this with me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />This is my signature dish - the recipe&nbsp;<strong>fell into my lap</strong>&nbsp;years ago when I worked at one of the world's top restaurants - you wouldn't have heard of it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Oh wouldn't I? Well, it has got a lot of chilli in it so it's not to everyone's taste.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Water! Water!<br /><br /><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Where's the fire? Where's the fire?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>No fire... chilli... too much chilli. They don't like it...</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Idiots! They don't know good food when they've seen it!</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />They want something plain... simpler...</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Boring you mean. Right, I'll have to make spaghetti bolognaise. Well, now I'll need some pots and pans...</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>There's&nbsp;<strong>a stroke of luck</strong>&nbsp;- I've washed all these!</p> 
 <p>...&nbsp;<strong>better luck next time</strong>!</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>Has anyone seen Gordon at all?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />He hasn't arrived yet.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>Oh no! We've got three customers all at once – what are we going to do?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Calm down Peter. Have you given them all menus?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />No! I haven't...</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>Oh dear - it's 7 o'clock, where is Gordon? (Her mobile phone beeps) Oh he's sent a text... he's broken down and he's going to be late. That's all I need. I'm going to have to call in the emergency chef...</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I'll heat up the oven... and get the plates ready... and offer the customers a free glass of wine...</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>Great idea. And I'll hold the fort. Oh come on Gordon...&nbsp;<strong>this feels like an eternity</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />They've already chosen what they want - 1 beef, 2 duck, 1 salad... or is it 1 duck, 2 beef...? Where is Gordon? What am I going to say to them? Oh dear.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Wine... (she gives a glass of wine to Peter)</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>Thank you (he drinks it).</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>That was for the customer.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>Oh sorry.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Take this one to them... and tell them there'll be a slight delay while we search for the freshest ingredients.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br /><strong>Better late than never</strong>&nbsp;- we've got a big order on. You're going to have to make up for lost time.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />I know. I know.&nbsp;<strong>All in good time</strong>. Now I'll make one of my special chef sauces shall I?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />It's a bit&nbsp;<strong>late in the day</strong>&nbsp;for that.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Why?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>Everyone's gone. They said 'time is money', and they've run out of time.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>And we're going to run out of money! Can't you just get on the bus next time you come to work Gordon - it's much more reliable.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>You can borrow my bike if you like?</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oh hi Peter.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>Hi.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Are you ok?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>Yes... Perfect.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />It doesn't look very perfect.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Well it is. It's just something&nbsp;<strong>took me by surprise</strong>. Look...</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />&pound;10?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>Yes. It's my first ever tip.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oh&nbsp;<strong>how sweet</strong>. Oh and it's a really big tip too - well done. You deserve it. But you'd better get back out there and earn some more...</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Oh yes... ok... thanks Mary.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>Ah Mary. I'll need you to wash those pans as quickly as possible please.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />OK.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>Gordon. Could you lend me &pound;10? I need it for the milkman.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Oh... very well. There you go: &pound;10.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>Thank you!</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>Mary. I can't believe it. I've lost that tip that I was given. I thought I'd put it in my back pocket and then I went into the restaurant...</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Oh dear Peter. A tip?! How&nbsp;<strong>very touching</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />It was his first ... and it was&nbsp;<strong>a nice touch</strong>. Hang on Gordon, didn't I see you pick something up off the floor a minute ago?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Well... I... no, I don't think so.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Hmm... I see Gordon. Seeing as you're a kind and generous... and well paid man, you could give Peter &pound;10... just out of the goodness of your heart.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>Thank you.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>You seem...&nbsp;<strong>full of the joys of spring</strong>. Are you feeling OK Gordon?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />You mean happy? There is nothing wrong with being happy... now, where did I put the onions?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Do you think there is something odd about Gordon today?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Yes... he's cheerful. He seems to be&nbsp;<strong>on cloud 9</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>I wish he was on cloud 9!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Hi Gordon. Ceilia's worried about you... has something happened? You just seem very... happy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />I am&nbsp;<strong>on top of the world</strong>&nbsp;actually... don't tell Ceilia but I might have a new job! I had an interview yesterday.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Wow! I bet you're&nbsp;<strong>thrilled to bits</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />I am Mary - oh the idea of working in a proper restaurant, with customers who appreciate my food, and the pay's better too. Ah, that bit was&nbsp;<strong>music to my ears</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />... music in your ears?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Oh never mind. What do you want?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>Customer on table 6 wants the raspberry Pavlova for dessert. (The office phone rings) I'll get that shall I? It's the Poison Ivy restaurant! ....aha... aha... ok... bye. They said, 'Sorry you haven't got the job - they've chosen someone better'.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>Oh, let's all&nbsp;<strong>jump for joy</strong>&nbsp;shall we! Gordon is going to be with us a little bit longer.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Raspberry, Gordon?</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Are you OK, Gordon?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Yes. Just leave me to cook.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />OK, don't bite my head off.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Is everything OK?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />It's this recipe - I can't get it right. It's doing my head in.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Maybe I could help?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />What do you know about cooking?! Don't forget: I'm the chef.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Well, I used to cook for you at home, when we were married - before I became your boss.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />That was beans on toast - this is very different.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Table three... or is it two... wants to know where their food is.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Maybe I could just help you...</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />For crying out loud! You're driving me crackers! You've ruined it! What am I going to do now?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Maybe... I could go and get something ready-made from the supermarket?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />From the supermarket!!! Don't make my blood boil more than it already is. Do you think world-class chefs buy ready meals from the supermarket? Honestly!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />OK, don't blow your top. When I was young my mum would add a spoonful of mustard into all her cooking and it made everything taste so nice. Now, why not give that a go?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Go on Gordon, give that a go, and maybe it will stop you getting so hot under the collar.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Very well. Hmm, doesn't taste bad. I think I've created something good here.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Well done Mary - we should name the dish 'The Mary Miracle Meal' after you!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />No, I don't think so. We'll call it 'Gordon's Greatest Goulash'.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>I've got an order from table 3...</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>Amazing, he wants the 'chef's special' - duck a la plum. Now this should be good.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>Duck a la plum!? Shouldn't it be duck a l'orange Gordon? &nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>This is my 'chef's special' - just leave it to me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>I'll go and tell him it's on its way.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>...and give him a glass of wine -&nbsp;on the house.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Problem Gordon?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />The oven won't light - the cooker's&nbsp;<strong>on the blink</strong>! Where did you get this piece of junk from?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>I bought it second hand. It was in good working condition.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Try pressing that button there.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />What do you know about cookers, huh? Can't you see it's kaput -&nbsp;<strong>knackered</strong>! We're going to lose yet another customer now. I was really looking forward to cooking my duck a la plum!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Have you tried the gas connections?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>Don't be ridiculous - I have worked in some of the world's top restaurants - and I know when a cooker has&nbsp;<strong>packed up</strong>&nbsp;- and this one has completely&nbsp;<strong>had it</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>Oh... I'll go and tell him the duck's off shall I?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Wait a minute Peter. If I just press this knob here - now try that a try.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Ah... well...</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>Well done Mary.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>So we're '<strong>cooking on gas'</strong>&nbsp;then! I'll go and give the customer the good news. Mary you're brilliant!</p>

"<p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Quick! Quick!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />What?! Is it a fire? Right, everybody calm down! Calm down!</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />What? It's not a fire. We've got a customer…</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />A customer?! At last.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Well, what does he want? I haven't got all day.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />He wants the… 'Spatchcocked peasant with lemon and herbs.'</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Pheasant, not peasant. Call yourself a waiter? Honestly...</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>Come on then Gordon, get a move on, we can't let another customer get away.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />I know, I know. Now where did I put the pheasant…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />I'll give you a hand if you like.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />You stick to washing up, love. Cooking pheasant is&nbsp;a job for a professional chef… now where is that stupid pheasant?</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />…the customer says 'pull your finger out' – he's off to the theatre soon.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />I'll tell him where he can stick his finger…</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Gordon, stay here and cook – come on, quick as a flash.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />I need a pheasant!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />I've found the pheasant - and it doesn't smell too fresh.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Can't we get a fresh one A.S.A.P.?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Where are we going to get a pheasant at this time of night? – anyway, I cook, not go shopping.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />OK, I'll go and tell the customer shall I?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia<br /></strong>We need a quick fix… can't we use a chicken?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon</strong><br />Chicken isn't pheasant.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Listen, listen… we don't need a pheasant.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Why?</p>

 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>Yes. He's in there sitting down.</p>

 <p><strong>Peter</strong><br />Right. OK. Wait there.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter<br /></strong>Right, he says he wants the duck eggs and polenta fries but with a small change…</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>Yes?<br /><br /><strong>Peter</strong><br />He wants a hen's egg instead of a duck's and… potato fries instead of polenta fries.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gordon<br /></strong>What?! So he wants egg 'n' chips. I have not worked in some of the world's top restaurants to end up cooking egg&nbsp;and chips!.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br />Gordon, Gordon&nbsp;<strong>keep your hair on</strong>! Customer's is always right – and thank goodness we've got one.&nbsp;So, let's try to keep him happy and - who knows - he might bring his friends next time.</p>

 <p><strong>Ceilia</strong><br /><strong>Don't get your knickers in a twist</strong>&nbsp;Gordon.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary&nbsp;</strong><br />Look, why don't I go and speak to him and see if wouldn't rather have Gordon's duck egg and polenta fries.</p>

 "
"<p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Wow! This feels so good. Hey! Master! Come on in!</p> 
 <p><strong>Master<br /></strong>Sorry, Gulliver… I've got a busy day tomorrow. I need to prepare… I'll wait for you over there in that field…</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>You don't know what you're missing…</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrating<br /></strong>It was so hot that day. We'd just been to see one of the Master's herd of yahoos. He let me go with him when he went to check up on them. I wanted to study them, since it was supposed that I was the same species. I hadn't really taken seriously what the Master had said about the houyhnhnms wanting to get rid of the yahoos. Who would they use to carry things for them and work in the fields?</p> 
 <p>I always felt dirty after being near yahoos – they always tried to grab me – so that day I'd stripped off and jumped in the ice water – to cool down and wash their smell off my skin. Little did I know we'd been followed and I was being watched.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Hey… get off me… what are you doing?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>She was clawing at me and pulling me to her. I knew exactly what she was trying to do. I could smell her desire…</p> 
 <p><strong>Master<br /></strong>Get off him, you filthy savage.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>I felt so ashamed. The Master&nbsp;<strong>hauled</strong>&nbsp;the young female yahoo off me. She scrambled out of the water and ran off, howling.</p> 
 <p><strong>Master<br /></strong>Are you alright, Gulliver? I heard you shouting.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Yes… I think so.</p> 
 <p><strong>Master<br /></strong>Did she frighten you? She really wanted to…</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>I know… She thought I was one of them!</p> 
 <p><strong>Master<br /></strong>Gulliver – look at your reflection in the water…</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>I looked down at my bare arms and bare chest… at the hair on my head. There was no escaping it. I was the lowest beast… a yahoo. I had their body and shape. But I had the soul of a houyhnhnm.</p> 
 <p>Three years I'd spent among the houyhnhnms – three wonderful years.</p> 
 <p>Their world was truly based on reason, friendship and kindness. They valued cleanliness and exercise. There were no robbers or murderers. There were no bullies, liars or cheats.</p> 
 <p>By contrast, the yahoos were the filthiest, noisiest, most deformed animal nature had ever produced… and… and I was one of them.</p> 
 <p><strong>Master<br /></strong>Gulliver, I have bad news I'm afraid.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>What is it? Has there been a death?</p> 
 <p><strong>Master<br /></strong>No, it's not that – death is not something we houyhnhnms feel sad about… It is part of life… No, it's you. Some houyhnhnms aren't happy that you live with my family. They think it's unnatural. They say you should go and join the yahoos or leave.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>What? There is no way I can live with the yahoos… Can't you persuade the assembly that I can live quietly with you? I could be your pet…</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>He didn't answer for a while. He bent his head.</p> 
 <p><strong>Master<br /></strong>No, Gulliver. I have no power against the assembly's decision. You must go… leave.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>But I love it here. I can't go back to England to live with the yahoos there.</p> 
 <p><strong>Master<br /></strong>I know. You have made a lot of progress… but you cannot stay. They have given you just two months to get ready.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>When I thought of my family, my friends back home, my countrymen, and the whole human race, I thought of them now as they really were – yahoos in shape and character.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>But where will I go? The yahoos in England disgust me now.</p> 
 <p><strong>Master<br /></strong>There is nothing more I can do. Even if I went against the assembly, you couldn't stay. It wouldn't be safe.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>I was devastated. But I had no choice.</p> 
 <p>Over the next few weeks I made a canoe of wood with the help of some of the houyhnhnms. I filled it with food and drink.</p> 
 <p>I said goodbye to the Master and his family. We all cried as I pushed the boat out.</p> 
 <p>I decided to look for a deserted island where I could spend the rest of my life in peace, untroubled by yahoos and with memories of the wonderful houyhnhnms.</p> 
 <p>I landed on a small rocky island and camped by a small stream. A few days later, I saw a boat in the distance, and quickly hid. Several yahoo sailors came ashore for fresh water. They found me and despite my struggles, took me back to their boat and their captain.</p> 
 <p><strong>Spanish sailor<br /></strong>Captain Hernandez, we can't understand what he's saying. He speaks like a horse. I think he's English.</p> 
 <p><strong>Captain<br /></strong>He needs food and drink and sleep. We'll take him back to Cadiz.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>The captain was polite and generous, but he wouldn't accept that I wanted to stay on the island. We returned to Spain. I stayed in my cabin the whole time, pretending I was sick, as I could not bear being with any of the crew. Eventually I boarded a ship for England and returned, after being five years away.</p> 
 <p>When I saw my wife and children, I felt sick. I couldn't bear their yahoo smell… I bought two horses and I kept them in my stable. They have never been ridden. I speak to them for hours each day. They are my friends.</p> 
 <p>Although I hate all yahoos, I decided to write this account of my journeys over the last sixteen years and seven months so that I might reform the yahoo race, so that I can change them. For this reason, I have told the whole truth. I have seen many worlds.</p> 
 <p>This was a true story.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>My name is Gulliver, and this is the story of my travels.</p> 
 <p>It was September 1710. I'd set sail from Portsmouth, but my luck ran out after just a few weeks. My crew rose up against me and&nbsp;<strong>mutinied</strong>. I was put&nbsp;<strong>ashore&nbsp;</strong>at the first island we saw.</p> 
 <p>On following a path from the beach, I was relieved to notice some&nbsp;<strong>tracks</strong>&nbsp;– a few looked human, but most were from horses. So I was not alone – thank goodness!</p> 
 <p>As I passed one field, I saw some animals. They were ugly looking with long beards like goats, and thick&nbsp;<strong>ragged</strong>&nbsp;hair on their chest and their heads. The rest of their bodies were bare.Some moved towards me and I hurried on. But one of them blocked my way. It raised its filthy claws.</p> 
 <p>I swiped at it with my sword.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Out of my way!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>I hit the creature and it howled. Within seconds, a herd of the creatures descended on me, their ugly faces&nbsp;<strong>leering</strong>&nbsp;and spitting…</p> 
 <p>Suddenly they all fled.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>Then I saw it – a beautiful grey&nbsp;<strong>stallion&nbsp;</strong>trotting gracefully out of the woods. Its smooth&nbsp;<strong>mane</strong>&nbsp;and back were gleaming in the&nbsp;<strong>dappled&nbsp;</strong>sunlight. It was this superb animal that had scared off the creatures.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Here boy… You're a beauty aren't you… Here…</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>The horse stopped,&nbsp;<strong>circled</strong>&nbsp;around me, eyeing me all the time. It lifted its head away as I went to stroke it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Where's your owner then? Won't you let me ride you? – I'm really tired …</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Are you trying to say something?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>It was as if he was talking to me…</p> 
 <p>Out of the trees another horse approached, a brown one. It stopped by us. Then the most extraordinary thing happened! Both horses lifted up their right&nbsp;<strong>hooves</strong>&nbsp;and touched each other's hoof in greeting.</p> 
 <p>I couldn't believe it… They were really talking to each other. They kept glancing at me and then bent their heads together as they communicated.</p> 
 <p>There was no doubt – I definitely heard the word 'yahoo' several times.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Ya… hoo.</p> 
 <p><strong>Master (grey horse)<br /></strong>Yahoo.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Gentlemen, I see you are magicians who have taken the shape of horses. Please… take me to your master so I can find some food and drink.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>And so they led the way. After a mile, we came to a long, low building, made of logs. But when we went in, there were no people – just a&nbsp;<strong>mare&nbsp;</strong>and two&nbsp;<strong>foals</strong>.</p> 
 <p>I followed the grey stallion through the door and into a yard. Here, tied up, were two&nbsp;<strong>deformed</strong>&nbsp;creatures like those I'd seen earlier. They were eating lumps of meat.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mare<br /></strong>Yahoo?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>The stallion picked up some meat and offered it to me, but the smell made me feel sick.</p> 
 <p>Then&nbsp;<strong>it dawned on me</strong>. This creature was a 'yahoo'. That's what the horses called them! They thought I was one of them! A yahoo!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>No… no, I'm not a yahoo!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>But then I took a closer look at the yahoo. He had two legs and arms … like mine, except his nails were long and shaped like claws. He was… in fact… a man… like me… but …&nbsp;<strong>savage</strong>!</p> 
 <p>In the following days, I was looked after well by the stallion. It became clear to me that the houyhnhnms, as these horses were called, were no ordinary animals – they had their own language, which they pronounced through the nose and roof of the mouth. I set about learning it and was soon able to talk easily with the grey stallion, whom I called Master. He was a very patient teacher.</p> 
 <p>The houyhnhnms were the kindest, gentlest, most honest and civilized race I'd ever come across. Months passed and I felt healthy and happy to live among them. They saw me as some kind of superior yahoo – they were confused because, although I bore some resemblance physically to those beasts, they thought my clothes were part of my body.</p> 
 <p>I told Master where I came from and how I had got to their country, but he could not believe that there was another land beyond the sea or that yahoos could build boats… Nor could he understand when I described our society – where innocent people are killed in wars. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>In England, Master, the horses work in the fields for the people.</p> 
 <p><strong>Master<br /></strong>How can this be? How can there be a country where yahoos are in charge?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narration<br /></strong>The more we talked and the more I learnt about their society, the more the failings of my own became clear. And it became clear, I was a yahoo after all.</p> 
 <p><strong>Master<br /></strong>There is something I must tell you, Gulliver… now that I know your secret… There is one question we houyhnhnms, are at this very moment debating… whether we should get rid of the yahoos once and for all.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>He said yahoos were&nbsp;<strong>vile</strong>&nbsp;and dangerous and threatened the peace and tranquillity of his society…</p> 
 <p><strong>Master</strong><br />I know that you are different to the other yahoos. But there are many who think that you are just one of them…</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>I knew what that meant. My life was in danger…</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Scientist A<br /></strong>Yeeess?</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Monodi<br /></strong>We're here to look round the Academy… I'm Lady Monodi… and this is Dr Gulliver, from England.</p> 
 <p><strong>Scientist A<br /></strong>England! Ahh! Land of great mathematicians and astronomers – Isaac Newton – now he is the talk of the Academy at the moment with his theory of&nbsp;<strong>gravity</strong>… Is it true that it was an apple falling on his head that gave him the idea?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>I believe so…</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Monodi<br /></strong>I'm sure Gulliver would like to see what goes on in our great Academy…</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>I was indeed interested to see what went on in the Academy but equally, I was glad to spend more time in the company of Lady Monodi. She was a delightful companion, not ignorant as the King had described her.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Do you visit Lagado often?</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Monodi<br /></strong>My husband Lord Monodi spends all his time reading astronomy books and thinking… I get&nbsp;<strong>so</strong>&nbsp;bored on Laputa… You know, my husband won't even notice I'm gone.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Really?</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Monodi<br /></strong>Yes, I prefer it here in Lagado, even though life down here is hard and most people are very poor. It's&nbsp;<strong>infinitely</strong>&nbsp;preferable to a life of&nbsp;<strong>abstract</strong>&nbsp;thinking… Don't you think?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>I wondered if Lady Monodi was secretly making plans for me… I knew I would have to get away before I&nbsp;<strong>fell for</strong>&nbsp;her completely. But first, as a doctor, I was keen to see the famous Academy and meet the scientists working there.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Monodi<br /></strong>I'm sure you won't have seen any inventions before like the ones here. They are quite&nbsp;<strong>at the cutting edge&nbsp;</strong>of science…</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>Lady Monodi was right. I was totally unprepared for what I was to find.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Monodi<br /></strong>Interesting experiment going on here…</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>The room we entered had a huge pile of cucumbers in the middle. A woman covered in&nbsp;<strong>soot&nbsp;</strong>and with&nbsp;<strong>scorched</strong>&nbsp;hair was holding half a cucumber in her hand. The other blackened half, was on the floor.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>And what is your project?</p> 
 <p><strong>Scientist B<br /></strong>Ah… well, I am&nbsp;<strong>extracting</strong>&nbsp;sunbeams from cucumbers…</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>I'm sorry…? Did you say &quot;extracting sunbeams … from… cucumbers&quot;?</p> 
 <p><strong>Scientist B<br /></strong>Yes… That's right… So people can use them to keep warm in winter. A cucumber takes in sunlight to grow, so we should be able to extract the sunlight…</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>And have you managed to extract any yet?</p> 
 <p><strong>Scientist B<br /></strong>Well…not quite yet…I think I'm getting very close to it though…</p> 
 <p>[SFX: Explosion]</p> 
 <p><strong>Scientist B<br /></strong>Oh dear!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>And how long have you been working on this project?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Scientist B<br /></strong>Oh, only eight years….</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Right, I see… Well good luck!</p> 
 <p>[To himself] You'll need more than that…</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Monodi<br /></strong>Now, you will be very interested in the project in this next room. A very learned&nbsp;<strong>physician</strong>&nbsp;is conducting an important experiment. He is famous for curing the problem of&nbsp;<strong>wind</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Now that could be useful. It's something I suffer from… Perhaps he can help me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>In the room we had just entered there was a dog in the middle of the floor and a man standing over it with some&nbsp;<strong>bellows</strong>&nbsp;pointing towards the dog's backside.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>What are you doing?</p> 
 <p><strong>Scientist C<br /></strong>Well, if the dog is suffering from a little bit of wind, then using the bellows gently, I draw the bad air out. If the condition is serious, like in the case of this dog… if I squeeze the bellows hard like this… air goes in and out of the dog…</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>I see…This dog looks pretty dead to me…</p> 
 <p><strong>Scientist C<br /></strong>Is he? Oh dear! How unfortunate… He may recover if I just… gently squeeze the bellows so I that I can draw out air… like that… Now did I hear you say that you also suffer from wind? 'Cause if you like, I can…</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>No, I think you must have misheard me… We ought to move on!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>We hurried out, leaving the doctor trying to revive the poor dog. We visited several other laboratories all with quite bizarre experiments that&nbsp;<strong>frankly</strong>, seemed pointless and with little chance of success.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>And do they get funding for their experiments?</p> 
 <p><strong>Monodi<br /></strong>Yes, of course.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>But how can&nbsp;<strong>so</strong>&nbsp;much money be spent on these pointless,&nbsp;<strong>degrading</strong>&nbsp;projects…when people are living in&nbsp;<strong>such</strong>&nbsp;misery?</p> 
 <p><strong>Monodi<br /></strong>You're not impressed then?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>No, I'm not. These aren't creative projects. They're unhealthy and impractical. What's more – they're immoral – people are starving in the city. Monodi, I've seen&nbsp;<strong>enough</strong>. I want to go home…</p> 
 <p><strong>Monodi<br /></strong>You mean back to Laputa…?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>No… to England. Is there a ship that can take me…?</p> 
 <p><strong>Monodi<br /></strong>You need to take the ferry to Glubbdubdrib. From there you can get on board a boat for Japan, and then England. I'll be sorry to see you go, Gulliver.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>You have been very kind and a great guide. But I have been away many months and I miss my country and my family.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>So, I left the beautiful Lady Monodi and sailed first to Glubbdubdrib, which she had forgotten to tell me, was a land of magicians. I had several adventures there, which are quite another tale… From Glubbdubdrib, I went to Japan and boarded a ship to England…</p> 
 <p>It was wonderful to be&nbsp;<strong>reunited</strong>&nbsp;with my wife and children. I knew, though, that it wouldn't be long before sea life would tempt me once again. Little did I know that even more dangerous adventures lay ahead of me.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Sailor<br /></strong>Dr Gulliver! I see a ship coming toward us.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Let me look... Pirates! Quick - fill the sails... full speed ahead!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>Yes, pirates. They caught us. Luckily, they spared my life but set me&nbsp;<strong>adrift</strong>&nbsp;in a small canoe with paddles and enough food for only three days.</p> 
 <p>I'm Gulliver - and this is my third voyage - to the mysterious land of Laputa.</p> 
 <p>Once again a voyage I'd begun full of hope ended in&nbsp;<strong>misfortune</strong>. My luck ran out when the pirates arrived, so here I was,&nbsp;<strong>floating</strong>&nbsp;in a canoe.</p> 
 <p>For three days I saw nothing and no one - just mile upon mile of water and sky. Then I came upon a tiny rocky island and survived there by roasting birds' eggs, eating dried seaweed and drinking from pools of water. My situation seemed hopeless. But one morning... a black shadow crossed the sun and the air went cold. I looked up and there... in the sky, to my amazement, was what looked like a huge mountain slowly&nbsp;<strong>moving</strong>&nbsp;towards me...</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>It's an island,&nbsp;<strong>floating</strong>&nbsp;in the air!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>It was about two miles deep, smooth and flat at the bottom. Through my telescope I could&nbsp;<strong>make out</strong>&nbsp;people moving up and down green slopes...</p> 
 <p>Near me, a long line of rope&nbsp;<strong>dangled&nbsp;</strong>from its edge all the way down to the sea...</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>They're fishing! ...</p> 
 <p>Hey! Hello! Over here! Here... Come and rescue me! Hello, hey!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>A fisherman leaned over and peered at me. He shouted and more people arrived and pointed at me.</p> 
 <p>Not long after, a long chain was&nbsp;<strong>winched</strong>&nbsp;down with a seat. I climbed in and was gently pulled up. I felt on top of the world.</p> 
 <p>I was greeted by some of the strangest-looking&nbsp;<strong>mortals</strong>&nbsp;I'd ever seen... they had a dreamy, faraway look as if they were thinking about anything but what was in front of them.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>I was&nbsp;<strong>escorted</strong>&nbsp;to the King, though this took a while as my guides kept forgetting where we were going.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver</strong><br />Where am I?</p> 
 <p><strong>Laputian</strong><br />Where are... oh, you're... sorry? What did you ask?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Where am I?</p> 
 <p><strong>Laputian<br /></strong>Why, Laputa, of course.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>The King, too, was deep in thought, seated in front of a table with all kinds of mathematical and astronomical objects. He looked up, but after acknowledging me, then ignored me. It was an hour before he remembered I was there.</p> 
 <p>But now, it seemed, it was finally time to join the king for supper.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Our food? Does it please you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>It's... um, delicious...</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>Actually, it was the oddest-looking food I'd ever seen - the meat was cut in the shape of triangles, the bread was shaped like cones and cylinders and the puddings, like flutes.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>The dish you are eating is my favourite - it's like a beautiful&nbsp;<strong>symphony</strong>. I hope you are enjoying our music... Is your music&nbsp;<strong>harmonious</strong>&nbsp;like ours?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>It is... different. So this land is called, Laputa?</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Oh yes. It is the only part of my kingdom that can fly. We float continuously from one part of the country to the other. We are currently passing over Lagudo, our capital city...</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>The king told me they were on their way to the Grand Academy of Science and Research in their capital city... He told me the Laputians are great mathematicians and musicians. I had already realised this.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Would you like to visit the academy? Come with me.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>We went onto the balcony and from there I looked down onto the huge city of Laguda. Badly constructed houses with&nbsp;<strong>crooked</strong>&nbsp;roofs leant to one side. The people were poorly dressed and looked miserable. In the distance I could see a huge building with smoke and strange substances rising from it. This was the famous Academy.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>I have no more time to entertain you. I have to get back to my... thinking.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>[bell]&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Laputian<br /></strong>Yes, your Majesty.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Send for Lady Monodi.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Lady Monodi will take you to the Academy and be your guide. She is not very intelligent and is quite unfashionable, but she is from Laguda&nbsp;<strong>visiting</strong>&nbsp;and is very welcoming...&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Laputian<br /></strong>[announcing] Lady Monodi.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Monodi<br /></strong>How can I help you, Your Majesty?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>I have to admit that I wasn't really looking forward to visiting Laguda and its crooked Academy guided by an ignorant, unfashionable woman. But when Lady Monodi entered, I quickly changed my mind. She was&nbsp;<strong>stunning</strong>! Her eyes were bright, intelligent and sparkling, full of curiosity and humour, not vague like those of everyone else on Laputa.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Suddenly I was glad to be leaving this floating island with its dreamy mathematicians. It was time to explore the Academy. I had no idea what I would find.</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>Come here and listen to my tale – for I am Gulliver, and I have seen many strange things in my life, and many parts of the world that should not be seen. The land of Lilliput with tiny people, no bigger than my foot... And now this land, Brobdingnag, where I am but a mouse beside the giants who live here.</p> 
 <p>And today, I was to meet the king of Brobdingnag.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Welcome, Gulliver. Tell me, how do you like my kingdom?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Your Majesty, your people have been extremely kind to me. I dine on delicious food with the Queen, and live in a beautiful house made just for me. Next week&nbsp;<strong>I'll have lived</strong>&nbsp;here for one year.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Well, I see. But...?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>But, your Majesty, this is not my home. I miss my own people, and wish to return there.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Ah yes. The Queen has told me about a place called... England? Tell me, do you have laws in England?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver</strong><br />Yes we do. And we have policies too, and political parties... the debates between our parties are magnificent!</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Political parties! But you're so small. Oh, I say!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Yes, we have the Whigs and the Tories.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>And which are you - a Whig or a Tory?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>The more I talked about England, the more he just laughed. I needed to tell him something that would impress him – make him realise what a great nation we were. Then I thought of it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>There is one thing we have in England, that you don't have in Brobdingnag, Sir.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>And what's that, little man?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong><strong>Gunpowder</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Gunpowder?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Yes, for all your guns.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Explain.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>England's armies are the&nbsp;<strong>envy</strong>&nbsp;of the world. And the secret of our power is gunpowder. You see, powder is&nbsp;<strong>rammed</strong>&nbsp;into a&nbsp;<strong>hollow</strong>&nbsp;iron tube, and then set alight, forcing the ball of metal, through the tube...</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator</strong><br />The king sat in silence.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver</strong><br />We can destroy whole&nbsp;<strong>ranks</strong>&nbsp;of an army at once, sink down ships, attack cities and tear up their houses. It's&nbsp;<strong>glorious</strong>. And you can have the secret. I will offer it to you, to&nbsp;<strong>enforce</strong>&nbsp;your rule.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>I am amazed, Gulliver.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Yes?</p> 
 <p><strong>King</strong><br />I am amazed at how a little insect like you, can have such&nbsp;<strong>inhuman</strong>&nbsp;ideas. The blood and&nbsp;<strong>desolation</strong>&nbsp;you speak of so familiarly, it comes from an evil source. Speak of this gunpowder no more.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>No, your Majesty.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>I seem to have offended him, for the king nor queen ever invited me back again. Nobody liked me at court. Only my dear friend Glumdalclitch still cared for me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>I need to get home.</p> 
 <p><strong>Glumdalclitch<br /></strong>But I love it here Gulliver. I've learned to write, to sing, to sew... and they pay me well. Soon,&nbsp;<strong>I'll have saved&nbsp;</strong>enough to buy a new farm for Mum and Dad. I don't want to go home, not yet.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver</strong><br />But I need to. Walk with me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>Glumdalclitch took me in my travelling box and we set off. Soon the court was far behind us and we walked through the strange land of Brobdingnag. It was&nbsp;<strong>vast</strong>&nbsp;- at least 6,000 miles across. There was no way I could escape alone. And the island was surrounded by rough seas - so much so, that no other nations ever came to trade here. I was stuck.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>What's that? Wait... where... Glumdalclitch!!!!</p> 
 <p><strong>Glumdalclitch<br /></strong>Gulliver!!!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>I was being carried high into the sky by... a bird! I looked out from my case and yes – a huge eagle was carrying my travelling box in its claws. We went higher and higher – and Brobdingnag grew smaller. And then we were over the sea – I saw the rough waves breaking beneath – before, with a great cry – he dropped my box – right down into the waters. I floated, and floated for hours until I fell asleep on the waters...</p> 
 <p><strong>Sailor<br /></strong>Hello, anyone there?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>English voices? I had been rescued.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver</strong><br />It's me, Gulliver! Gosh you're... small!</p> 
 <p><strong>Sailor<br /></strong>What? And why are you shouting?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Sorry. It's just... you wouldn't believe me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>The journey home took a month, and soon I was nearing my own front door. My dear wife ran out to embrace me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver's wife<br /></strong>My... my Gulliver?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>My... dear.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>And so my second voyage was at an end. In truth, it took me some time to adjust to life with my own people. I had seen such strange things. Life was not the same.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver's wife<br /></strong>Promise me you will never go to sea again.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>I wish I could. But as you may guess, this was not my unfortunate destiny. On my next voyage, my life changed forever, and I saw the terrible things that man had created.</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>I'm Gulliver. This is the story of my life in the strange land of Brobdingnag, where I was but the size of a mouse among giants.</p> 
 <p>My master, the farmer who found me, saw me as a way to make money. Every day I was made to perform for the amusement of a crowd. I danced and sang for them. Until one day, I collapsed with exhaustion.</p> 
 <p><strong>Glumdalclitch<br /></strong>Gulliver!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>That was my dear Glumdalclitch, the farmer's daughter, and my only true friend here.</p> 
 <p><strong>Glumdalclitch<br /></strong>He's fainted! Father, I told you it was too much. He'll die.</p> 
 <p><strong>Farmer</strong><br />Don't worry dear, he's fine, aren't you Gulliver?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>I'm... I'm OK.</p> 
 <p><strong>Sladral<br /></strong>Excuse me. I'm here on official business.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong><strong>Although</strong>&nbsp;I was exhausted, I looked up to see a finely dressed man.</p> 
 <p><strong>Sladral</strong><br />Will the little man live?</p> 
 <p><strong>Farmer<br /></strong>Oh, he's&nbsp;<strong>as right as rain</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Sladral<br /></strong>Good. The Queen has heard of this Gulliver, and would like to see him for herself.</p> 
 <p><strong>Farmer<br /></strong>Oh, of course my lord. But... well I'm like a father to him. I couldn't...</p> 
 <p><strong>Sladral<br /></strong>We'll pay you, of course. One thousand&nbsp;<strong>gold pieces</strong>? And the girl - she will come with us too and live in the palace.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>Of course, the greedy farmer agreed without any hesitation. Before I knew it, we were on our way to the palace. I felt relieved.</p> 
 <p><strong>Sladral<br /></strong>Your Majesty. May I present, Mr Gulliver. Oh, and his maid, Glumdalclitch.</p> 
 <p><strong>Glumdalclitch<br /></strong>Your Majesty.</p> 
 <p><strong>Queen<br /></strong>Yes, yes, now where is this Gulliver?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Down here, your Majesty. It is an honour. May I kiss your royal foot?</p> 
 <p><strong>Queen<br /></strong>He speaks! It's true... Mr Gulliver, you may kiss... my&nbsp;<strong>fingertip</strong>!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>My lady.</p> 
 <p><strong>Queen<br /></strong>He's lovely. He will dine with me tonight!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong><strong>Despite</strong>&nbsp;the Queen's beauty and kindness, at dinner I was quite&nbsp;<strong>appalled&nbsp;</strong>by her behaviour. At one mouthful she ate as much as 12 English farmers would eat in a meal – crunching the wing of a&nbsp;<strong>lark</strong>, bones and all – though it were nine times the size of a turkey.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver</strong><br />Quite an appetite, your Majesty!&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narration</strong><br />Not that it mattered. I was happy to rest and eat well. Everyone at court was&nbsp;<strong>enchanted</strong>&nbsp;by me!</p> 
 <p><strong>Queen<br /></strong>Are you enjoying the meat, Gulliver?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver</strong><br />Oh certainly, Madam. It's delicious.</p> 
 <p><strong>Queen</strong><br />Oh, have some more.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narration<br /></strong>Everyone at court loved me, except that is, the Queen's dwarf<strong>.</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Dwarf<br /></strong><strong>Pipsqueak</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Pipsqueak? Me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narration</strong><br />He had lost his position now that he was no longer the shortest man in the kingdom. And he wasn't happy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Dwarf<br /></strong>Yes. Quite a big meal for a little&nbsp;<strong>runt</strong>. Just you wait.</p> 
 <p><strong>Queen<br /></strong>Gulliver, do hurry and finish supper, I have a present for you!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narration</strong><br />It was a house made by the finest craftsman in the land. It was the perfect size for me, with little chairs and a table, and even a lock to keep out rats. Best of all, laid on my bed, shirts of the finest silk. Though Brobdingnag silk is rather rough for a man of my size.</p> 
 <p>Life passed in this way for some time. I was treated like royalty! But&nbsp;<strong>in spite of</strong>&nbsp;the fine dining and beautiful clothes, life at court was not always so smooth. Especially because of my, adventures...</p> 
 <p><strong>Queen<br /></strong>Gulliver, tell them what happened today!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>I was attacked by a large fly, your Majesty.</p> 
 <p><strong>Sladral<br /></strong>Oh Gulliver, we heard you had an accident today?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver</strong><br />An apple, Sir. It fell on my back. It almost broke it...</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>I was getting upset. Even my dear Glumdalclitch seemed to find me funny. I had to get out of the court. I&nbsp;<strong>slipped away</strong>&nbsp;from everyone, and wandered down a vast hallway.</p> 
 <p><strong>Dwarf<br /></strong>Psst.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver</strong><br />Oh you. Go away, dwarf.</p> 
 <p><strong>Dwarf</strong><br />That's no way to speak to a friend. I have just the thing to&nbsp;<strong>soothe</strong>&nbsp;you after their&nbsp;<strong>mockery</strong>, Gulliver. Come with me.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>I had no choice but to follow him. We arrived in a quiet study. The dwarf scooped me up.</p> 
 <p><strong>Dwarf<br /></strong>Some dessert, my friend? Or should I say, a&nbsp;<strong>just desert</strong>&nbsp;for you Gulliver?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Now, now. What's this?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>It was a giant bowl of honey. Over which the dwarf held me...</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver</strong><br />Hey, we're not enemies. Listen, you're like a big brother to me...</p> 
 <p><strong>Dwarf</strong><br />In you go.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver</strong><br />No, wait. Please.</p> 
 <p>[sfx: splash]</p> 
 <p><strong>Dwarf</strong><br />No one will know.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>I struggled and struggled, and tried to swim, taking mouthfuls of the sweet honey. But I had been a sailor for many years, and I made it out.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver</strong><br />There! Not so easy to stop me, dwarf!<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Dwarf<br /></strong>Oh, well done, Gulliver. Such a shame there are so many wasps at this time of year! They do so like honey...</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>And off he went. From the window, I heard a buzzing sound. Ten large wasps, the size of eagles – were flying towards me!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Take that! And you. Come here, wasp! I've not finished with you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>I fought off the wasps. And collapsed, exhausted.</p> 
 <p>Life in Brobdingnag had become very dangerous for me. But how could I escape from this land of giants? I decided I had to meet with the king.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>My name is Gulliver. Let me tell you the story of my second voyage, to the strange land of Brobdingnag.</p> 
 <p>I had spent the winter in England, but soon became&nbsp;<strong>restless</strong>. I said farewell to my wife and family to&nbsp;<strong>seek my fortune</strong>&nbsp;across the sea once more. The wide world waited for me!</p> 
 <p>But sea voyages don't always go to plan. A huge storm blew up. And when it passed, we found ourselves...</p> 
 <p><strong>Sailor<br /></strong>Land ahoy!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>...at an island.</p> 
 <p><strong>Sailor<br /></strong>Food and water. We get what we need and set sail. And men, stay&nbsp;<strong>armed</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>It was&nbsp;<strong>barren</strong>&nbsp;and rocky. I set off alone to explore, but I found nothing. When I returned to the beach...</p> 
 <p><strong>Sailor<br /></strong>Run! Back to the boat!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Where are you going?! Stop!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>The men were already in back in the boat, rowing&nbsp;<strong>for their lives</strong>, and... a huge creature was chasing them, like a man, but so... tall. I can't tell you what happened, for I turned and ran for my life...</p> 
 <p>I ran into a giant field, where I hid under stalks of corn rising 40 feet into the sky.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>What is this place?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>I felt sick. Across the field I saw another man-creature, as tall as a church&nbsp;<strong>steeple</strong>, harvesting the giant corn.</p> 
 <p><strong>Brobdingnag farmer<br /></strong>What have we here?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver</strong><br />Don't eat me!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>He spoke a strange&nbsp;<strong>tongue</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Brobdingnag farmer<br /></strong>[booming voice] Like a little... man.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>Just then he&nbsp;<strong>scooped</strong>&nbsp;me up, close to his face. His breath was&nbsp;<strong>foul</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Brobdingnag farmer<br /></strong>I think the wife would like to see this.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>And he tucked me into his coat pocket. How I trembled with fear as he walked back to his house.</p> 
 <p><strong>Farmer's wife<br /></strong>[Screams] It's a mouse! Get it out of my kitchen!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>The farmer's wife was shocked when she saw me. For there I stood, on their kitchen table, his whole, huge family looking at me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Farmer's wife<br /></strong>It's a man! So tiny.</p> 
 <p><strong>Glumdalclitch<br /></strong>He must be hungry, mother.</p> 
 <p><strong>Farmer's wife<br /></strong>Here, give him some meat.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Oh, thank you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator</strong><br />And they pushed a huge slice of meat my way. With a thimble of&nbsp;<strong>ale</strong>.</p> 
 <p>My drinking seemed to amuse them. The ale made me a little bolder, and I did a little dance for them. Perhaps they would treat me well... But just then...</p> 
 <p>[sfx: baby crying]</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>What's that?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>A huge baby, that's what it was. Thankfully, the baby soon fell asleep.</p> 
 <p>And so did I. The farmer's daughter tucked me into bed with a handkerchief for a blanket. It was heavy and rough like the sail of a warship, but I was exhausted.</p> 
 <p><strong>Glumdalclitch<br /></strong>Good morning my little man. My name's Glumdalclitch. Glumdalclitch.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Glumdal... Oh, what? Your name? Glumdalclitch?</p> 
 <p><strong>Glumdalclitch<br /></strong>Oh, he said my name! He's so cute. I'm Glumdalclitch and you're...?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver</strong><br />She's asking my name. I'm Gulliver. Gulliver!<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>The farmer's daughter must have been only nine or ten years old, and a&nbsp;<strong>mere</strong>&nbsp;30 feet tall. She was kind to me and became my closest friend. Over the next days she taught me their language, which I learned fast. Life was good, for a while.</p> 
 <p><strong>Farmer<br /></strong>Gulliver! We're going to town. Come here.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>To town? Yes, sir, of course.</p> 
 <p><strong>Glumdalclitch<br /></strong>Don't worry Gulliver, we're taking you to market, so people can see you. You've become quite famous! Here, I've made this little travelling box.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver</strong><br />Why thank you Glumdalclitch.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>I climbed inside, and off we went. The journey was bumpy, like rising and falling in a ship in a great storm. Finally we came to a rest, somewhere... indoors.</p> 
 <p><strong>Farmer<br /></strong>[To Gulliver] Now then little man, let's see if we can earn ourselves&nbsp;<strong>a pretty penny</strong>.</p> 
 <p>[To the crowd] Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the smallest man in Brobdingnag!</p> 
 <p><strong>Crowd<br /></strong>[sfx: gasping]</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>And the farmer opened the box. Out I stepped onto a table – in a room full of giant people...</p> 
 <p><strong>Farmer<br /></strong>Now Gulliver, show them what you can do.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Err, good day to you all! I am Gulliver!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>And so I performed for them. I danced, and&nbsp;<strong>fenced</strong>&nbsp;with my sword… I drank another thimble of ale. The crowd loved me!</p> 
 <p><strong>Farmer<br /></strong>That's three crowns each. Next performance, at six o'clock. Thank you Madam... Thank you Sir...</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>And so it went. The next day we did three shows. Then ten the next. Then 15. I was exhausted. But the farmer kept pushing me. Poor Glumdalclitch tried to stop him. But it was no use.</p> 
 <p><strong>Glumdalclitch<br /></strong>Father, he can't go on. He must rest today. He'll die.</p> 
 <p><strong>Farmer<br /></strong>Well,<strong>&nbsp;if he dies, we'll make no more money</strong>. Let's make as much as we can, first.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>I lost my appetite. I feared I would die here, in this strange land, miles from home.&nbsp;<strong>Oh, if only I had stayed at home in England, none of this would have happened!</strong>&nbsp;But just as I thought all was lost... something wonderful happened. I'll tell you about that, next time.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Crowds</strong><br />Fire! Fire!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>[waking up] Eh… Ooh…</p> 
 <p><strong>Young girl<br /></strong>Dr Gulliver, wake up! The palace is on fire!&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>What…? Eugh…</p> 
 <p><strong>Young girl<br /></strong>You must help us! Hurry!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>What? I'm coming.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>The tiny Lilliputians were running here and there, passing buckets of water the size of&nbsp;<strong>thimbles</strong>. They were useless against the huge flames.</p> 
 <p><strong>Flimnap<br /></strong>Quick, Gulliver, you've got to help us! Where's your jacket? You can use it to&nbsp;<strong>smother</strong>&nbsp;the flames.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>I haven't got it! I was in such a rush…</p> 
 <p><strong>Flimnap<br /></strong>Oh no.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Wait. I've got an idea! I drank a lot of wine last night and I really need to…</p> 
 <p>[sound of rushing water]&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Queen<br /></strong>Ugh! It's splashing on me! What a terrible smell!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>The fire was out in minutes. I didn't wait for thanks but hurried home to sleep.</p> 
 <p>I was a hero, or so I thought. I learnt much later that the Queen was horrified by the way I'd&nbsp;<strong>extinguished</strong>&nbsp;the fire, even though Flimnap explained to her that if it hadn't been for me, the palace would have burnt down. She refused to return to her rooms, even though they were thoroughly cleaned, and she&nbsp;<strong>swore</strong>&nbsp;to have&nbsp;<strong>revenge</strong>.</p> 
 <p>In the meantime, before I heard how angry the Queen was, I continued to enjoy the hospitality of the Lilliputians. They made me shirts and bed linen. Three hundred cooks prepared my daily food. I ate a lot to impress the King but later learnt that Skyresh used this against me, persuading the King that I was&nbsp;<strong>bankrupting</strong>&nbsp;the country.</p> 
 <p><strong>I got used</strong>&nbsp;to my life of comfort in Lilliput and ideas about escape faded away. But late one evening, Flimnap arranged to meet me outside the city walls.</p> 
 <p>We met in secret in the light of the moon.</p> 
 <p><strong>Flimnap<br /></strong>Gulliver, you are in serious danger. No one knows I am here. I've come to warn you as you are my friend. Skyresh and the Queen are plotting your&nbsp;<strong>downfall</strong>. They've drawn up a list of your crimes…</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Crimes? What crimes?</p> 
 <p><strong>Flimnap<br /></strong>They're accusing you of&nbsp;<strong>high treason</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Treason!! But… What did I do against the state? I'm a hero in Lilliput!</p> 
 <p><strong>Flimnap<br /></strong>Well…</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>As I found out, Skyresh had been plotting against me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Skyresh<br /></strong>The law clearly states that whoever passes water in the palace is committing an act of high treason…</p> 
 <p><strong>Flimnap<br /></strong>Yes, Skyresh, but the palace would have burnt down if Gulliver hadn't&nbsp;<strong>urinated&nbsp;</strong>on it!</p> 
 <p><strong>Skyresh<br /></strong>It was a&nbsp;<strong>malicious</strong>&nbsp;act, meant to shame the Queen!</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>It's true… the Queen is extremely unhappy about the whole situation.</p> 
 <p><strong>Skyresh<br /></strong>Yes, your majesty. There are&nbsp;<strong>rumours</strong>…</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Rumours? About what?</p> 
 <p><strong>Skyresh<br /></strong>About Gulliver and the wives of some of the ministers…</p> 
 <p><strong>Flimnap<br /></strong>Those are just rumours. There's no proof.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>I was outraged.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>But I saved the palace. I knew Skyresh hated me from the start. I don't know why…</p> 
 <p><strong>Flimnap<br /></strong>Yes, and he hates you even more now you've defeated the Blefuscu navy. He's admiral of the Lilliput fleet and your victory makes him look weak. He now has the support of the Queen and several other ministers. It's serious, Gulliver.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>What are they going to do?</p> 
 <p><strong>Flimnap<br /></strong>Punish you…</p> 
 <p><strong>Skyresh<br /></strong>We'll set his house on fire so that he burns to death. We'll fire poisoned arrows at his face and hands and smear his shirts and sheets with deadly poison so that he dies in agony…</p> 
 <p><strong>Flimnap<br /></strong>Your Majesty! He has saved us from invasion!</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>It does seem a little harsh, Skyresh. I have always been a fair and just ruler. We won't execute him. We'll just blind him. My doctors will put poisoned arrows into his eyes as he is lying down.</p> 
 <p><strong>Skyresh<br /></strong>But your Majesty, we'll still have to feed him! In fact, he might eat more when he's blind…</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>We'll feed him less and less each day so that he becomes weak and dies of starvation.</p> 
 <p><strong>Skyresh<br /></strong>Very well, your Majesty. There is no time to lose. I will arrange for the blinding to take place in three days…</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>The King's judgement seemed neither fair nor just. I&nbsp;<strong>used to</strong>&nbsp;trust the Lilliputians, but now? Time was short.</p> 
 <p>As the sun rose the following day, I swam across to Blefuscu. There on the beach, I spotted… a rowing boat… of my size!</p> 
 <p>The Blefuscans helped me make huge oars and ten days later, I was ready.</p> 
 <p>I set off with six tiny cows and sheep in my pockets and not a moment too soon. In the distance I could see the Lilliputian ships setting sail - for Blefuscu! They were coming after me.</p> 
 <p>I longed for England and my family. After a day at sea, I spotted an English ship returning from Japan. The captain did not believe my amazing stories, but was amazed when I showed him the miniature sheep and cows.</p> 
 <p>On arriving back in England, I was delighted to be reunited with my family. But as time went on, I wanted to return to the waves and I set sail once again on a new voyage. Little did I know I would soon face terrible horrors…</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Blefuscu captain<br /></strong>Pull those sails down quickly, lads! There's a good wind today… We'll give those Lilliputians a surprise. Oh,&nbsp;<strong>we'll be celebrating</strong>&nbsp;tonight…</p> 
 <p><strong>Boy<br /></strong>Aye, aye sir… eh… What? Cap'n! Cap'n! Quick… Look! Look!</p> 
 <p><strong>Blefuscu captain<br /></strong>What's up, boy? What's the problem? Seen a ghost?</p> 
 <p><strong>Boy<br /></strong>Not a ghost. A… a… giant! He's huge… he's coming this way… walking through the waves!</p> 
 <p><strong>Blefusucu captain<br /></strong>Holy smoke! He's the size of a mountain!&nbsp;<strong>Abandon ship</strong>! Abandon ship!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>Yes. I, Gulliver, was crossing the&nbsp;<strong>stretch</strong>&nbsp;of water between Lilliput and the island of Blefuscu, half swimming, half&nbsp;<strong>wading</strong>, carrying ropes and iron hooks.</p> 
 <p>I had a plan to save Lilliput from&nbsp;<strong>invasion</strong>&nbsp;by the islanders of Blefuscu – it was dangerous, but I had made a promise to the king in return for my freedom.</p> 
 <p>Skyresh, the chief&nbsp;<strong>admiral</strong>&nbsp;and my enemy, brought me the news.</p> 
 <p><strong>Skyresh<br /></strong>The King has agreed to set you free.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Yippeee! Thank you, Skyresh. That's fantastic news!</p> 
 <p><strong>Skyresh<br /></strong>Against my advice, mind you… And there is a price.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Oh… What is that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Skyresh<br /></strong>I have the contract written here: &quot;Conditions to be promised by the Man-Mountain in return for his freedom. One: He shall not leave Lilliput without permission… Two: When a messenger has to travel a long way, they may ask…</p> 
 <p>&quot;Finally, he shall help us in our war against Blefuscu.&quot;</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Ble… fu…?</p> 
 <p><strong>Flimnap<br /></strong>Blefuscu. The kingdom of Blefuscu lies to the north-east of ours. Its&nbsp;<strong>inhabitants</strong>&nbsp;are our deadly enemies. At this very moment their navy is preparing to invade us.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>What are you fighting over? Land? Religion?</p> 
 <p><strong>Skyresh<br /></strong>Eggs.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Eggs?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Skyresh<br /></strong>Yes, here on Lilliput, we believe that eggs should be cracked at the small end. This is because our King's grandfather cut his finger when breaking an egg at the big end. But over in Blefuscu they crack their eggs at the big end. It's an&nbsp;<strong>outrage</strong>&nbsp;and an insult. Those so-called Big-Endians across the sea are our enemies now.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>I… understand.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>This seemed the strangest of reasons to go to war, and yet… in my own country there had been stranger causes of wars.</p> 
 <p><strong>Skyresh<br /></strong>Before we unlock your chain, you must promise to obey these rules.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>I had no choice.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>I, Lemuel Gulliver do solemnly swear to defend the state of Lilliput and do all I can to destroy the Blefuscu navy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Skyresh<br /></strong>One more thing: if you break any of the conditions in the contract, the consequences will be serious.&nbsp;<strong>We'll be watching</strong>&nbsp;you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>And so at last, I was free from my chains and could walk about the island as I wished.</p> 
 <p>I went to the coast to see how I could escape from Lilliput. But all I could see were miles and miles of ocean. But in the distance there was one small, rocky island – Blefuscu!</p> 
 <p>They were getting ready to attack Lilliput. It was time to&nbsp;<strong>honour</strong>&nbsp;my promise to defend the island. A bold plan appeared in my mind…</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Flimnap, I need some of your strongest rope and your heaviest iron bars.</p> 
 <p><strong>Flimnap<br /></strong>That is a strange request.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>You will see… Trust me. I have a plan. I can save Lilliput.</p> 
 <p><strong>Flimnap<br /></strong>Very well. I trust you, Gulliver.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>You're a good woman and a true friend, Flimnap.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>I twisted three ropes together into one, so it was like thick&nbsp;<strong>cord</strong>. I bent the iron bars into hooks and fixed them on the ends of the cords. With these, I strode into the sea. I swam for half an hour, and then, when the Blefuscu harbour came into view, I waded with the ropes behind me…</p> 
 <p>When the Blefuscu sailors saw me, they were so frightened, they&nbsp;<strong>leapt</strong>&nbsp;from the ships and swam to shore. There were about 30,000 of them.</p> 
 <p>I fixed one of my iron hooks to each empty ship. When the people on the shore realised what I was doing, they fired arrows at me.</p> 
 <p>But I remembered my glasses and put them on to protect my eyes. I then pulled the ships away…</p> 
 <p>Crowds were waiting for me at Lilliput harbour as I brought the entire Blefuscu fleet with me there.</p> 
 <p>They called me a hero. The king was delighted and wanted me to help him attack Blefuscu. But I told him that I had promised to defend Lilliput, not to invade Blefuscu and make its people slaves. I persuaded him that it was better to live in peace.</p> 
 <p>Soon afterwards, something happened that was to change my life in Lilliput completely. It started in the middle of the night…</p> 
 <p><strong>Crowds<br /></strong>Fire! Fire! Help! The palace is on fire!</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Gulliver</strong><br />Ooh, ouch! Hey! Help!&nbsp;<strong>Get off</strong>&nbsp;me!! Where am I?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>I'm lying on my back. I'm being&nbsp;<strong>pricked</strong>&nbsp;by lots of tiny sharp things. My arms and legs are tied to the ground – even my long hair is&nbsp;<strong>fastened</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>I… can't… move!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>It's the strangest sight! Hundreds of tiny figures are&nbsp;<strong>prodding</strong>&nbsp;me with&nbsp;<strong>miniature</strong>&nbsp;spears. Others are fastening bits of string and hammering tiny&nbsp;<strong>pegs</strong>&nbsp;into the ground. The tiny figures are…</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>…humans?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>Yes little ones, no higher than six inches tall!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>I must be dreaming!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>I shut my eyes and open them again. No… I'm not dreaming – I'm tied to the ground – I'm&nbsp;<strong>well and truly</strong>&nbsp;a&nbsp;<strong>prisoner</strong>.</p> 
 <p>My name is Gulliver. This story of my travels to distant lands may seem unbelievable, and in places, disturbing – but the lands I visited and the strange peoples I met are not imaginary, I didn't&nbsp;<strong>make them up</strong>. Please listen and remember… it is all true.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Sailor<br /></strong>Dr Gulliver… the men, the men are feeling sick…</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>I was a ship's doctor. We'd set sail from Bristol in England in 1699 and were heading for the East Indies. I'd left my wife and two children behind. A violent storm broke out…</p> 
 <p>…in the strong winds, we were shipwrecked on a large rock close to land.</p> 
 <p>I swam, battling with huge waves.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>On reaching the shore, I&nbsp;<strong>pulled myself up</strong>&nbsp;on some soft grass and fell asleep, exhausted.</p> 
 <p>And there, during the night I became a prisoner of the tiny people. I was so amazed when I saw the tiny human creatures prodding me that I roared and they all ran back terrified. They started to shoot arrows from their bows – onto my hands, my body… my face…</p> 
 <p>The arrows pricked me like hundreds of needles. I struggled violently and&nbsp;<strong>snapped</strong>&nbsp;the strings on my left arm and quickly covered my eyes to protect them.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>No more… Stop!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>I fell back and lay still. Once they realised I wasn't going to attack them or move, they stood back and waited.</p> 
 <p>One of them, wearing fine clothes, so clearly important, ventured forward from the crowd.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>Ah… Sir… Now… Don't worry… I'm not going to eat you… But…</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>I pointed to my mouth…</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>I'm very hungry… I need food… food!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>The one in charge nodded his head.</p> 
 <p>A few minutes later ladders were put against my body and a long line of tiny people mounted them, carrying dishes of meat, baskets of tiny loaves of bread, and small barrels of wine slung over their shoulders.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver<br /></strong>This is… very good…!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator</strong><br />I ate and drank greedily. Those tiny&nbsp;<strong>morsels&nbsp;</strong>of food and drink were some of the most exquisite food I have ever tasted. The tiny natives were amazed at my appetite.</p> 
 <p>With my stomach full, I promptly&nbsp;<strong>nodded off</strong>.</p> 
 <p>When I&nbsp;<strong>woke up</strong>, I was moving. I later found out that the wine I had drunk had contained a sleeping drug and whilst I was sleeping, 900 of the tiny natives had lifted me onto a machine which was being pulled by a thousand tiny horses. I was taken to the city to meet the king, who greeted me warmly…</p> 
 <p>He was young and dignified, with strong features. He gave a long speech to me in his language, but I did not understand a word. But he pointed to the city and his people, with a sweep of his arm.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>… Lilliput…</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narration<br /></strong>Some&nbsp;<strong>courtiers</strong>&nbsp;were also there. One had a wise and scholarly look and made friendly gestures to me. Her name, I later learnt, was Flimnap. She was the King's secretary. Another, who had a rather mean expression, drew his sword at various points and waved it in a rather threatening way in the air at me. This was Skyresh.</p> 
 <p>I was then transported to an empty, ruined temple, where I was lifted up with&nbsp;<strong>pulleys&nbsp;</strong>and chained to the gates. I was still a prisoner, but at least now I could, at last, stand up.</p> 
 <p>And so it was that I became a guest in the kingdom of Lilliput with its tiny inhabitants. The ruined temple became my home. The royal family came regularly to watch me from the tower. The King sent 30&nbsp;<strong>scholars</strong> to teach me the Lilliputian language, which I learnt very quickly.</p> 
 <p>One night I couldn't sleep. I heard the whisper of voices close by. It was the King with his courtiers Flimnap and Skyresh… What Skyresh said worried me deeply…</p> 
 <p><strong>Skyresh<br /></strong>I think that we should kill him…</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Why do you say that, Skyresh?</p> 
 <p><strong>Skyresh<br /></strong>He eats too much, your Majesty! It is costing us a fortune and if we continue to feed him like this, we'll have a&nbsp;<strong>famine</strong>&nbsp;in Lilliput.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>How do you suggest we kill him?</p> 
 <p><strong>Skyresh<br /></strong>Starve him!</p> 
 <p><strong>Flimnap<br /></strong>That's&nbsp;<strong>barbaric</strong>!</p> 
 <p><strong>Skyresh<br /></strong>Or we could shoot him with poisoned arrows.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>What do you think, Flimnap?</p> 
 <p><strong>Flimnap<br /></strong>He is a giant and the&nbsp;<strong>decay</strong>&nbsp;of his body could cause a plague which could spread throughout the kingdom.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>That's very true… He asks for his freedom every day.</p> 
 <p><strong>Skyresh<br /></strong>It's too dangerous! He could kill all of us!</p> 
 <p><strong>Flimnap<br /></strong>He has so far been gentle and well behaved towards the people of Lilliput. He could be useful to us…</p> 
 <p>We can give him his freedom with certain conditions…</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>…which would be?</p> 
 <p><strong>Flimnap<br /></strong>He becomes our&nbsp;<strong>ally</strong>&nbsp;in our war against Blefuscu and destroys their&nbsp;<strong>fleet</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Flimnap, you're right! We are facing a grave danger and this giant Gulliver could save us!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gulliver narrator<br /></strong>I had heard enough. Lilliput was&nbsp;<strong>on the brink</strong>&nbsp;<strong>of</strong>&nbsp;war. The King would not kill me whilst I was useful to him, but what if he changed his mind? I had to escape!</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Lady Bracknell is visiting Jack's house in the country. She won't allow Jack to marry Gwendolen, and Jack, who is Cecily's&nbsp;<strong>guardian</strong>, won't allow Cecily to marry Algernon.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Come here, dear child.&nbsp;How old are you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily<br /></strong>Eighteen.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Well, you'll soon be able to decide yourself who to marry.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Excuse me, Lady Bracknell, but Miss Cardew doesn't&nbsp;<strong>come of age</strong>&nbsp;until she is 35, only then can she marry who she likes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Oh, that's not a problem.&nbsp;Thirty-five is a very attractive age.&nbsp;London society is full of women who have remained 35 for years. Lady Dumbleton, for example, she's been 35 ever since she turned 40, a long time ago.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />But I can't wait that long. I hate waiting even five minutes for someone. Waiting, even to be married, is just not possible.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Well, what shall we do, Cecily?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />I don't know, Algernon.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />My dear Mr Worthing, as Miss Cardew says she cannot wait till she is 35 – which seems to indicate she is a little impatient – could you change your mind?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />My dear Lady Bracknell, the moment you agree to my marriage with Gwendolen, I will happily allow your nephew to become engaged to Cecily.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />That is impossible. Look at the time! Gwendolen, dear, we've already missed five trains.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>But they'll miss the next one, too, because Reverend Chasuble arrives to announce that everything is ready for the&nbsp;<strong>christenings</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Christenings, sir!&nbsp;Isn't that a little&nbsp;<strong>premature</strong>?</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />Both these gentlemen have said they want to be christened this afternoon.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />At their age?&nbsp;That's ridiculous!&nbsp;Algernon, Lord Bracknell would be very unhappy if he knew this was how you wasted your time and money.</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />So, no christenings this afternoon?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />It would be no use to either of us, Reverend Chasuble, at the moment.</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />Well, I'll return to the church straight away. It seems Miss Prism has been waiting there for me for an hour and a half.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Miss Prism!&nbsp;Did you say Miss Prism?</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />Yes, Lady Bracknell.&nbsp;I'm going to see her now.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Wait a moment. Is this Miss Prism an unattractive woman, connected with education?</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />She's very well educated indeed.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />It's obviously the same person.&nbsp;And what position does she have in your house?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Miss Prism, Lady Bracknell, is Miss Cardew's&nbsp;<strong>governess</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />I must see her at once.</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />Well, she's here now! Look, she's coming up the garden path.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Miss Prism arrives. When she sees Lady Bracknell, she goes white.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Prism! Come here!&nbsp;Where is that baby? Twenty-eight years ago, Prism,&nbsp;<strong>you left my house with a pram in which a male baby was sleeping</strong>. You never came back.&nbsp;<strong>The police found the pram</strong>.It contained a novel but no baby! Prism!&nbsp;What happened to that baby?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />Lady Bracknell, I really don't know.&nbsp;I wish I did.&nbsp;This is what happened. I took the baby out in its pram as usual.&nbsp;<strong>I also took with me a large, old handbag in which I was intending to put the novel that I had written</strong>.&nbsp;In a moment&nbsp;<strong>when I wasn't thinking,</strong>&nbsp;<strong>I put the novel in the pram, and placed the baby in the bag</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />But where did you put the bag?</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />I left it in the&nbsp;<strong>cloakroom</strong>&nbsp;of a railway station in London.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Which railway station?</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />Victoria.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />I must just go to my room.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>He rushes off. After several minutes, Jack&nbsp;returns carrying a black leather bag.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Is this the bag, Miss Prism?</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />Yes, here are my&nbsp;<strong>initials</strong>.&nbsp;I'm so pleased to get it back so&nbsp;<strong>unexpectedly</strong>.&nbsp;It has been very&nbsp;<strong>inconvenient</strong>&nbsp;not to have it all these years.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Miss Prism, it's not just the bag that has been given back to you. I was the baby in it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />You?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Yes… mother!</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />Mr Worthing, there is some mistake!&nbsp;Lady Bracknell&nbsp;can tell you who you really are.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Lady Bracknell, I hate to be&nbsp;<strong>inquisitive</strong>, but could you tell me who I am?</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />I'm afraid you are the son of my poor sister, Mrs Moncrieff. You are Algernon's elder brother.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Algy's elder brother! Then I do have a brother. I always said I had a brother! Algy, you'll have to treat me with more respect in future. You have never behaved like a brother to me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I did my best.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />My darling!&nbsp;But what is your christian name, now that you have become someone else?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Good heavens! I had forgotten about that.&nbsp;Lady Bracknell,&nbsp;<strong>when Miss Prism left me in the bag, had I been christened already</strong>?</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Your parents gave you everything, including a christening.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Well, what name was I given?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />You were the eldest son, so you were given your father's name.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Yes, but what was his name?</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />I cannot remember the General's full name.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Algy!&nbsp;Can't you remember what our father's name was?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />My dear fellow, I was one when he died.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />His name would appear in the army lists, wouldn't it, Lady Bracknell?</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />That's true.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />I have the lists of the last 40 years here.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />He rushes to the bookcase and pulls the books out.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>Generals… Mallam, Migsby, Moncrieff! General 1869, his full name was… Jack Ernest! … I always told you, Gwendolen, my name was Ernest, didn't I? Well, it is Ernest after all.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Ernest! My own Ernest!&nbsp;I felt from the beginning that you could have no other name!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Gwendolen, it is a terrible thing for a man to suddenly find out that all his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth.&nbsp;Can you forgive me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />I can.&nbsp;For I'm sure you will change.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />My darling!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And Jack&nbsp;<strong>embraces</strong>&nbsp;Gwendolen. Algernon does the same with Cecily. Even Reverend Chasuble embraces someone – Miss Prism, much to her delight.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Gwendolen!&nbsp;At last!</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />My nephew, you are showing a lack of seriousness.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />No, it's the opposite, Lady Bracknell. I've now realised for the first time in my life the extreme Importance of Being&nbsp;<strong>Earnest</strong>.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Gwendolen and Cecily are angry with Jack and Algernon now they know their real names – neither of them are called Ernest. The two women are inside the house. The men come in trying to look and sound cheerful.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack and Algernon<br /></strong>[whistling Daisy, Daisy]</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />I'm sure they're feeling sorry. Let's not say anything.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Certainly not. Mr Moncrieff, why did you pretend to be my&nbsp;<strong>guardian</strong>'s brother?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />So that I had the opportunity to meet you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />That seems a satisfactory explanation, doesn't it Gwendolen?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Yes, if you can believe him.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />I don't.&nbsp;But his answer was so beautiful.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />True.&nbsp;In matters of great importance, it's style, not truth that is essential.&nbsp;Mr Worthing, why did you pretend to have a brother?&nbsp;Was it so you could come to London to see me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Do you have any doubts, dear Gwendolen?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />I have serious doubts.&nbsp;But I intend to ignore them.&nbsp;Cecily, should we forgive them?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Yes.&nbsp;I mean no.&nbsp;<strong>Probably</strong>&nbsp;not. What about their names?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />True!&nbsp;I had forgotten!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong>&nbsp;<strong>and</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Cecily</strong><br />Your names are still a huge problem!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong>&nbsp;<strong>and&nbsp;Algernon</strong><br />Our names!&nbsp;Is that all?&nbsp;But we are going to be&nbsp;<strong>christened&nbsp;</strong>with a different name this afternoon.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />You are prepared to do this terrible thing for me, Jack?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />I am.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />To please me you are ready to face this awful experience, Algernon?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I am!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />How can people talk about the equality of the sexes!&nbsp;Men have moments of physical&nbsp;<strong>courage</strong>&nbsp;which we women know&nbsp;<strong>absolutely</strong>&nbsp;nothing about.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Jack, darling!</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Cecily, darling!&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And they fall into each other's arms. Merriman comes in and coughs&nbsp;<strong>loudly</strong>. He announces a visitor.</p> 
 <p><strong>Merriman</strong><br />Ahem!&nbsp;Ahem!&nbsp;Lady Bracknell!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Good heavens!</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Gwendolen!&nbsp;What does this mean?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br /><strong>Simply</strong>&nbsp;that I am engaged to Mr Worthing, mamma.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Mr Worthing, I followed my daughter by train. Gwendolen is meant to be attending a university lecture. Well, that is what her father thinks. All communication between yourself and my daughter must end&nbsp;<strong>immediately</strong>.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />We are engaged to be married, Lady Bracknell!</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />You are nothing of the kind, sir.&nbsp;And now, what about Algernon! … Algernon!</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Yes, Aunt Augusta.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />May I ask if it is in this house that your sick friend Mr Bunbury lives?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Oh!&nbsp;No!&nbsp;Bunbury doesn't live here.&nbsp;Bunbury is somewhere else at the moment.&nbsp;In fact, Bunbury is dead.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Dead!&nbsp;When did he die?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Oh!&nbsp;I killed Bunbury this afternoon. I mean poor Bunbury died this afternoon.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />He died so&nbsp;<strong>suddenly</strong>? What did he die of?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I mean he was discovered!&nbsp;The doctors discovered that he could not live, so he died.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />He seems to have had great&nbsp;<strong>confidence</strong>&nbsp;in the opinion of his doctors.&nbsp;I am glad that he&nbsp;<strong>finally</strong>&nbsp;made up his mind to take some definite course of action, and acted under proper medical advice.&nbsp;And now, Mr Worthing, who is the young person whose hand my nephew Algernon is holding in an unnecessary way?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />That is Miss Cecily Cardew, I'm her guardian.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I am engaged to Cecily, Aunt Augusta.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />I beg your pardon?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Mr Moncrieff and I are engaged to be married, Lady Bracknell.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Lady Bracknell has to sit down at this news.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />There seems to be something&nbsp;<strong>unusually</strong>&nbsp;exciting in the air – the number of engagements seems to be above average. Mr Worthing, is Miss Cardew at all connected with any railway stations in London?&nbsp;I am&nbsp;<strong>simply</strong>&nbsp;asking.&nbsp;Until yesterday I didn't know any families or people whose origin was a station.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Miss Cecily Cardew is the granddaughter of the&nbsp;<strong>late</strong>&nbsp;Mr Thomas Cardew of 149 Belgrave Square; Gervase Park,&nbsp;<strong>Surrey</strong>; and the Sporran,&nbsp;<strong>Fifeshire</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Three addresses. That&nbsp;<strong>always</strong>&nbsp;gives me<strong>&nbsp;confidence</strong>. I am not unsatisfied.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />How&nbsp;<strong>extremely</strong>&nbsp;kind of you, Lady Bracknell!&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Now Gwendolen, we have to leave… Just one thing, Mr Worthing, does Miss Cardew have any money?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Oh! About &pound;130,000. That is all.&nbsp;Goodbye, Lady Bracknell.&nbsp;So pleased to have seen you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />A moment, Mr Worthing.&nbsp;&pound;130,000!&nbsp;Miss Cardew seems to me a most attractive young lady, now that I look at her. Come over here, dear… Turn round, dear child, so I can see your face.There are definite social possibilities in your face.&nbsp;Algernon!</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Yes, Aunt Augusta!</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />There are definite social possibilities in Miss Cardew.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I don't care about social possibilities.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Never speak&nbsp;<strong>disrespectfully</strong>&nbsp;of Society, Algernon.&nbsp;Only people who can't get into it do that.&nbsp;Now Miss Cardew, of course you know that Algernon has nothing but his&nbsp;<strong>debts&nbsp;</strong>to depend upon.&nbsp;But I do not approve of marriages for money. Well, I suppose I must give my&nbsp;<strong>consent</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Thank you, Aunt Augusta.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />The marriage had better take place quite soon. I am not in favour of long engagements. They give people the chance to find out each other's characters before marriage – never a good thing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />I'm sorry to interrupt you, Lady Bracknell, but I am Miss Cardew's guardian, and I don't give my consent to this marriage.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />And why not may I ask?&nbsp;Isn't Algernon an extremely&nbsp;<strong>eligible</strong>&nbsp;young man? He has nothing, but he looks everything.&nbsp;What more can one desire?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />The fact is that I do not&nbsp;<strong>approve</strong>&nbsp;of his&nbsp;<strong>moral</strong>&nbsp;character.&nbsp;He has not been honest.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Algernon&nbsp;and&nbsp;Cecily&nbsp;look at him amazed.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Untruthful! Algernon? Impossible!&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />I'm afraid there is no doubt.&nbsp;This afternoon he came to my house pretending to be my brother.&nbsp;He has succeeded in one afternoon to change the affections of dear Cecily.&nbsp;He then stayed to tea, and ate all the&nbsp;<strong>muffins</strong>.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Ahem! Mr Worthing, after careful consideration I have decided to forgive my nephew's behaviour.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />That is very generous of you, Lady Bracknell. However&nbsp;I have not changed my mind. I do not give my consent.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Cecily and Gwendolen both thought they were engaged to someone called Ernest. But Gwendolen has just found out her man's real name is Jack. Let's join them in the garden now, where Cecily is asking Algernon an important question...</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily<br /></strong>Are you engaged to Gwendolen?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Engaged to Gwendolen? Of course not!&nbsp;What made you think that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Thank you.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And Cecily lets Algernon kiss her on her cheek.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />I knew there was some slight error, Miss Cardew.&nbsp;<strong>The gentleman who is now</strong>&nbsp;<strong>embracing</strong>&nbsp;you is my cousin, Mr Algernon Moncrieff.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Algernon! Is your name Algernon?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I cannot&nbsp;<strong>deny</strong>&nbsp;it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Oh!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Is your name really Jack?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />My name certainly is Jack.&nbsp;It's been Jack for years.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Gwendolen, we have both been greatly&nbsp;<strong>deceived</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />My poor Cecily!</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />My sweet Gwendolen!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack&nbsp;</strong><strong>and&nbsp;Algernon</strong>&nbsp;<br />[groan]</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Mr Worthing, there is just one question I would like to ask you.&nbsp;Where is your brother Ernest?&nbsp;Cecily and I are both engaged to be married to your brother, so it is a&nbsp;<strong>matter</strong>&nbsp;of some importance to us to know where he is at present.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Gwendolen, Cecily, it is very painfulfor me to speak the truth and I am really quite inexperienced in doing anything of the kind.&nbsp;However, I will tell you quite frankly that I don't have a brother Ernest.&nbsp;I don't have a brother at all.&nbsp;I've never had a brother in my life, and I don't plan to ever have one in the future.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />No brother at all?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />None!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Have you never had a brother of any kind?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Never.&nbsp;Not even of any kind.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Cecily, it's quite clear that neither of us are engaged to be married to anyone.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />It's not a very pleasant position for a young girl suddenly to find herself in.&nbsp;Is it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Let's go in the house.&nbsp;They'll dare not come after us there.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />No, men are so&nbsp;<strong>cowardly</strong>, aren't they?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And the two women, who minutes before were arguing, now go arm in arm into the house.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />This awful situation is what you call&nbsp;<strong>Bunburying</strong>, I suppose?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Yes, and a wonderful Bunbury it is.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Well, you've no right to Bunbury here.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />That's absurd.&nbsp;People can Bunbury anywhere they choose.&nbsp;Every serious Bunburyist knows that.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Serious Bunburyist!&nbsp;Good heavens!</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Well, you have to be serious about something.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Well, the only satisfaction I have in all this terrible business is that your friend Bunbury is finished.&nbsp;You won't be able to run to the country quite as often as you used to, dear Algy.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Your brother is a little unwell, isn't he, dear Jack? You won't be able to disappear to London quite so frequently now.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />As for your behaviour towards Miss Cardew, I must say that fooling a sweet, innocent girl like that is quite&nbsp;<strong>inexcusable</strong>.&nbsp;To say nothing of the fact that I am her guardian.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I can see no excuse at all for you deceiving a clever, thoroughly experienced young lady like Miss Fairfax. To say nothing of the fact that she is my cousin.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />I wanted to be engaged to Gwendolen, that is all.&nbsp;I love her.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Well, I simply wanted to be engaged to Cecily. I adore her.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />There is certainly no chance of your marrying Miss Cardew.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />And I don't think it's very likely, Jack, that you and Miss Fairfax will be together. Ooh... muffins...</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Well, that's no business of yours... And how can you sit there, calmly eating muffins when we are in this horrible trouble? You seem perfectly&nbsp;<strong>heartless</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong>&nbsp;<br />[eating] Well, I can't eat muffins in a nervous way.&nbsp;The butter would probably get on my sleeves.&nbsp;You should always eat muffins quite calmly.&nbsp;It's the only way to eat them.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong>&nbsp;<br />Well, that's no reason to eat them all in that greedy way. Give them to me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon<br /></strong>But you just said it was heartless to eat muffins.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>Algy, I wish you would go.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />You can't possibly ask me to go without having some dinner.&nbsp;Besides I have just arranged with&nbsp;<strong>Reverend</strong>&nbsp;Chasuble to be christened at a quarter to six with the name of Ernest.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />My dear fellow, please stop that nonsense.&nbsp;I arranged this morning with Reverend Chasuble to be&nbsp;<strong>christened</strong>&nbsp;myself at 5.30, and I will, of course, take the name of Ernest. We can't both be called Ernest. Besides, I have a perfect&nbsp;<strong>right</strong>&nbsp;to be christened if I like.&nbsp;There is no evidence at all that I have ever been christened by anybody. You, on the other hand, have already been christened.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Yes, but I haven't been christened for years.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Yes, but you have been christened.&nbsp;That's the important thing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Yes, so I know I can stand it. You're not quite sure that you have ever been christened, and I think it would be rather dangerous to do it now.&nbsp;It might make you very unwell.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />[eating] Oh, that's nonsense; you are always talking nonsense.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Jack, you're eating the muffins again!&nbsp;I wish you wouldn't.&nbsp;There are only two left.&nbsp;I told you I was particularly fond of muffins.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Algernon!&nbsp;I have already told you to go.&nbsp;I don't want you here.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I haven't quite finished my tea yet! And there is still one muffin left.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />[groans in despair]&nbsp;</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Algernon and Cecily are engaged. But Cecily thinks his name is Ernest and so Algernon has rushed off to change his name. Meanwhile, Gwendolen has arrived and&nbsp;<strong>is about to&nbsp;</strong>meet Cecily for the first time. Gwendolen also thinks she's engaged to someone called Ernest.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Hello, my name is Cecily Cardew.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />What a sweet name! I like you already.&nbsp;I think&nbsp;<strong>we are going to be</strong>&nbsp;great friends.&nbsp;My&nbsp;<strong>first</strong>&nbsp;<strong>impressions</strong>&nbsp;of people are never wrong.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />How nice of you to like me so much when we have only just met.&nbsp;Please sit down.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />May I call you Cecily?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />With pleasure!</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />And you can call me Gwendolen… You are here on a short visit, I suppose.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Oh no!&nbsp;I live here.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Really?&nbsp;Your mother, no doubt, lives here, too?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Oh no!&nbsp;I don't have a mother or father - in fact, I don't have any relations.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Really?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />My dear&nbsp;<strong>guardian</strong>&nbsp;looks after me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Your guardian?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Yes, Mr Worthing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>She means Jack, of course.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Oh!&nbsp;That's strange - he's never mentioned to me that he was a guardian. And I'm not sure, that this news fills me with great delight... I have liked you ever since I met you, Cecily.&nbsp;But now that I know that Mr Worthing is your guardian, I can't help wishing that you were... well… just a little older, and not quite so... well... attractive.&nbsp;In fact, if I may speak honestly...</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Please do...</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Well, to be honest, Cecily, I wish that you were 42 and unattractive.&nbsp;Ernest would never lie to me. Though I don't always trust him, [to herself] especially with beautiful women.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />I'm sorry, Gwendolen, did you say Ernest?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Yes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Oh, but it isn't Mr Ernest Worthing who is my guardian.&nbsp;It's his brother - his elder brother.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>By Ernest Worthing, she means Algernon.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Ernest never mentioned to me that he had a brother.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Well, they haven't been getting along well for a long time.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Ah! that explains it.&nbsp;Cecily, you have greatly&nbsp;<strong>reassured&nbsp;</strong>me.&nbsp;I was beginning to get anxious.&nbsp;You are quite sure that it is not Mr Ernest Worthing who is your guardian?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Quite sure.&nbsp;In fact, I am going to be his.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />&nbsp;I beg your pardon?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />&nbsp;Dearest Gwendolen&nbsp;<strong>Mr Ernest Worthing and I are going to get married</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Now when Cecily says Ernest here, she, of course, means Algernon, who she thinks is called Ernest.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />My darling Cecily, there must be some mistake.&nbsp;Mr Ernest Worthing is engaged to me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And when Gwendolen says Ernest here, she, of course, means Jack.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen<br />The announcement will appear</strong>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;paperon Saturday.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />&nbsp;You must be mistaken.&nbsp;Ernest proposed to me ten minutes ago.&nbsp;I've written it in my diary.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />That's very strange, because he asked me marry him yesterday afternoon.&nbsp;Here, it's in my diary. I never travel without my diary.&nbsp;You should always have something excitingto read in the train. I'm sorry, dear Cecily, but I'm afraid he was mine first.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />It upsets me, dear Gwendolen, but I have to point out that since Ernest proposed to you, he has clearly changed his mind.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />If the poor fellow has been&nbsp;<strong>trapped</strong>&nbsp;<strong>I intend to rescue</strong>&nbsp;him at once.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong>&nbsp;<br />Whatever&nbsp;<strong>entanglement&nbsp;</strong>my dear boy has got into,&nbsp;<strong>I will never</strong>&nbsp;<strong>blame&nbsp;</strong>him.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Are you referring to me, Miss Cardew, as an entanglement?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Do you suggest, Miss Fairfax, that I trapped Ernest into an engagement?&nbsp;How dare you?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen<br /></strong>Miss Cardew…</p> 
 <p><strong>Merriman&nbsp;</strong><br />&nbsp;Ahem!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />But they are interrupted by Merriman who arrives with the tea. The two women look angrily at each other. They can't continue their argument in front of him.</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />&nbsp;Are there many interesting walks around here, Miss Cardew?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Oh! Yes! Several. From the top of the hills you can see five&nbsp;<strong>counties</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Five counties!&nbsp;I wouldn't like that; I hate crowds.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />&nbsp;I suppose that is why you live in London?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />&nbsp;Quite a well-kept garden this is, Miss Cardew.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />So glad you like it, Miss Fairfax.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />I had no idea there were any flowers in the country.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Oh, flowers are as common here, Miss Fairfax, as people are in London. Would you like some tea, Miss Fairfax?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />&nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;Awful girl!&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />&nbsp;Sugar?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />[Superciliously]&nbsp;No, thank you.&nbsp;Sugar is not fashionable any more.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Cecily&nbsp;puts four lumps of sugar into the cup, which she gives to Gwendolen, who does not notice as she is&nbsp;<strong>short-sighted</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />[Severely]&nbsp;Cake or bread and butter?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Bread and butter, please.&nbsp;Cake is rarely seen at the best houses nowadays.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Cecily cuts a large slice of cake and hands it to Gwendolen. Gwendolen&nbsp;drinks the tea and&nbsp;<strong>shudders</strong>.&nbsp;She puts down the cup, reaches out for the bread and butter and finds it's cake.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />You have put sugar in my tea, and though I asked quite clearly for bread and butter, you have given me cake.&nbsp;I usually have a gentle and sweet nature, but I warn you, Miss Cardew, you may go too far.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />I would do anything to save my poor, innocent boy from the secret plansof another girl.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />From the moment I saw you I distrusted you.&nbsp;My first impressions of people are always right.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />It seems to me, Miss Fairfax, that I am wasting your valuable time.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And here comes Jack.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Ernest!&nbsp;My own Ernest!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Gwendolen!&nbsp;Darling!&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />[Draws back]&nbsp;Wait!&nbsp;May I ask if you are engaged to this young lady?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />&nbsp;To dear little Cecily!&nbsp;Of course not!&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Thank you.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />&nbsp; I knew there must be some misunderstanding, Miss Fairfax.&nbsp;This gentleman is my guardian, Mr Jack Worthing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />I beg your pardon?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />This is Uncle Jack.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen</strong><br />Jack!&nbsp;Oh!&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And now Algernon arrives, too.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Here is Ernest.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Cecily, my love!&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Wait, Ernest!&nbsp;May I ask you - are you engaged to this young lady?</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Jack is not happy that Algernon has come to his house pretending to be his younger brother Ernest. And he's really not happy that Algernon has met Cecily, telling him to go back to London immediately. Jack has also asked Reverend Chasuble to christen him with a different name. Let's now join Algernon and Cecily in the garden.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon<br /></strong>I hope you won't mind, Cecily, if I tell you quite truthfully that you seem to me to be in every way absolutely perfect.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecil</strong><strong>y&nbsp;<br /></strong>I admire your honesty, Ernest.&nbsp;Now, can I just write down what you are saying in my diary.&nbsp;[Writing in diary] ev... er... y... way... abs...</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon<br /></strong>Do you really keep a diary?&nbsp;<strong>I'd love to</strong>&nbsp;have a look. May I?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oh no. You see, it's just a young girl's&nbsp;<strong>record</strong>&nbsp;of her own thoughts, so I can publish them. But, Ernest, please, don't stop talking.&nbsp;I love doing&nbsp;<strong>dictation</strong>.&nbsp;I have reached&nbsp;<em>'</em>absolutely perfect'.&nbsp;Go on...</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Ahem!&nbsp;Ahem!</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Oh, don't cough, Ernest. I don't know how to spell a cough.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br /><strong>The truth is,</strong>&nbsp;Cecily, ever since I first saw you, I have loved you wildly,&nbsp;<strong>passionately</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>hopelessly</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />[Writing] Wildly... passionately... Oh, I don't think that you should tell me that you love me wildly, passionately and hopelessly.&nbsp;Hopelessly doesn't make much sense, does it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Here comes the butler, Merriman, again...</p> 
 <p><strong>Merriman</strong><br />The carriage is waiting, sir.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Tell it to come back next week.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Uncle Jack would be very annoyed if he knew you were staying till next week.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Oh, I don't care about Jack. I only care about you.&nbsp;I love you, Cecily. You will marry me, won't you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br /><strong>What a question!</strong>&nbsp;Of course, silly!&nbsp;Well, we have been engaged for the last three months.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />For the last three months?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Yes, it will be exactly three months on Thursday.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />But how did we become engaged?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Well, ever since Uncle Jack told us that he had a&nbsp;<strong>wicked&nbsp;</strong>younger brother, you have been the main topic of conversation between myself and Miss Prism.&nbsp;And a man who is talked about a lot is always very attractive. I fell in love with you, Ernest.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br /><strong>Darling!&nbsp;</strong>And when did we actually get engaged?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />On the 14th of February.&nbsp;I got tired of the fact you didn't know I existed, and so, after a long&nbsp;<strong>struggle</strong>&nbsp;with myself, I decided to accept you under this dear old oak tree here.&nbsp;Here are all your letters in this box.&nbsp;Look...</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And my goodness... There's a whole&nbsp;<strong>bundle</strong>&nbsp;of letters neatly tied up with a blue&nbsp;<strong>ribbon</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />My letters!&nbsp;But, my own sweet Cecily, I have never written you any letters.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />You don't need to remind me, Ernest. I had to write your letters for you.&nbsp;I wrote three times a week, and sometimes more often.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Oh, do let me read them, Cecily.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Oh, no.&nbsp;They would make you far too&nbsp;<strong>conceited</strong>.&nbsp;The three you wrote after I had&nbsp;<strong>broken off&nbsp;</strong>the engagement are so beautiful, and so badly spelt, that even now I can hardly read them without crying a little.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />But did we break off our engagement?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Of course we did.&nbsp;On the 22nd of March.&nbsp;Look I'll read about it to you. [Reading from diary] 'Today I broke off my engagement with Ernest.&nbsp;I think it is the best thing to do.&nbsp;The weather is still lovely.'</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />But why on earth did you break it off?&nbsp;What had I done?&nbsp;I had done nothing at all.&nbsp;Cecily, I am very hurt to hear you broke it off.&nbsp;Particularly when the weather was so lovely.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />It wouldn't have been a really serious engagement if it hadn't been broken off at least once.&nbsp;But I forgave you very quickly.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong>&nbsp;<br /><strong>What an angel&nbsp;</strong>you are, Cecily!</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily<br /></strong>You dear romantic boy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />You'll never end our engagement again, will you Cecily?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Not now that I have actually met you.&nbsp;Besides, of course, there is&nbsp;<strong>the question of your name</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Yes, of course.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />You mustn't laugh at me, but it had always been a girlish dream of mine to love someone whose name was Ernest. That name&nbsp;<strong>inspires</strong>&nbsp;complete confidence.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />But, Cecily, do you mean that you could not love me if I had a different name?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />But what name?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Oh, any name you like - Algernon - for instance...</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />But I don't like the name Algernon. I might respect you, Ernest, but I don't think I'd be able to really love you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Ahem!&nbsp;Cecily! The Reverend is, I suppose, knows how to carry out all church ceremonies?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Oh, yes. Reverend Chasuble is a very clever man.&nbsp;He has never written a single book, so you can imagine how much he knows.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I must see him at once on a most important christening - I mean on important business.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Oh!</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I won't be away more than half an hour.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Considering that we have been engaged since February the 14th, and that I only met you today for the first time, I think it's rather hard that you should leave me for so long. Couldn't you make it 20 minutes?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />[He kisses her] I'll be back in no time.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Merriman arrives to announce the arrival of a visitor.</p> 
 <p><strong>Merriman</strong><br />A Miss Fairfax is here to see Mr Worthing.&nbsp;On very important business, Miss Fairfax says.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Isn't Mr Worthing in the library?</p> 
 <p><strong>Merriman</strong><br />Mr Worthing went to see Reverend Chasuble some time ago.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Please ask the lady to come out here. Mr Worthing will be back soon, I'm sure.&nbsp;And you can bring tea.</p> 
 <p><strong>Merriman</strong><br />Yes, Miss.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Miss Fairfax!&nbsp;I suppose one of the many elderly women who are associated with Uncle Jack in some of his goodwork in London.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>But it's not an elderly woman who follows Merriman into the garden.&nbsp;<strong>What a surprise!&nbsp;</strong>It's Gwendolen!</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Jack has returned earlier than expected to his house in the country. He's just told Miss Prism and Reverend Chasuble that his younger brother Ernest is dead. What they don't know is that Algernon is at the house at this very moment, pretending to be Ernest.</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />I am very sorry about your brother, Mr Worthing. I shall, of course, mention this tragic event in my&nbsp;<strong>sermon&nbsp;</strong>next Sunday.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />That would be most kind, Reverend.</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong>&nbsp;<br /><strong>I can usually adapt</strong>&nbsp;my weekly sermon to almost any occasion, happy or sad – weddings,&nbsp;<strong>christenings</strong>...</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Christenings... Ah! That reminds me, Reverend Chasuble.&nbsp;I suppose you do know how to&nbsp;<strong>christen</strong>?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />Well...</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I mean, of course,&nbsp;<strong>you often christen people</strong>, don't you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />But which baby do you want to christen, Mr Worthing?&nbsp;Your brother wasn't married, was he?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Oh no. But it's not for a child, Reverend. No! It's me - I'd like to be christened... this afternoon.</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />But surely&nbsp;<strong>you have been christened</strong>&nbsp;<strong>already</strong>?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />I don't remember anything about it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Well, what time would you like the ceremony performed?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Oh, around five if that would suit you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />Perfectly!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Just at this time, Cecily comes out of the house into the garden.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Uncle Jack!&nbsp;Oh, I am pleased to see you back.&nbsp;But why are you wearing those awful clothes?</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />Cecily!</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Oh! What's the matter, Uncle Jack? You look so sad, and I've got such a surprise for you.&nbsp;Who do you think is in the dining room?&nbsp;Your brother!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Who?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Your brother Ernest.&nbsp;He arrived about half an hour ago.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />But I haven't got a brother.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Oh, don't say that.&nbsp;However badly he may have behaved to you in the past, he is&nbsp;<strong>still&nbsp;</strong>your brother.&nbsp;I'll tell him to come out. You will shake hands with him, won't you, Uncle Jack?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>[Cecily leaves]</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />This is happy news...</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />My brother here?&nbsp;<strong>That's quite</strong>&nbsp;<strong>absurd</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Cecily comes out of the house again, this time holding Algernon's hand. &nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Good heavens!&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Brother Jack, I've come to tell you that I'm very sorry for all the trouble I've given you, and that I plan to lead a better life in the future.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Jack&nbsp;can't believe his eyes and stares at his friend. Algernon puts out his hand, but Jack ignores it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Uncle Jack, you are not going to refuse to shake your own brother's hand?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Nothing will make me shake his hand.&nbsp;I think him coming down here is&nbsp;<strong>disgraceful</strong>.&nbsp;He knows perfectly well why.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Uncle Jack, do be nice.&nbsp;There is some good in everyone.&nbsp;<strong>Ernest has just been telling me</strong>&nbsp;about his poor sick friend Mr Bunbury whom&nbsp;<strong>he often visits</strong>. And&nbsp;<strong>there must certainly be</strong>&nbsp;a lot of good in someone who is kind to a sick friend.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Oh! He's been talking about Bunbury, has he?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Yes, he has told me all about poor Mr Bunbury, and how ill he is.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Bunbury!&nbsp;Well, I won't let him talk to you about Bunbury or about anything else.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Of course I admit that I have not behaved well, but I expected a more enthusiastic welcome, especially as it's the first time I have come here.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Uncle Jack, if you don't shake hands with Ernest I'll never forgive you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Never forgive me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Never!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Well, this is the last time I shall ever do it... There!</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />I think we should leave the two brothers together.</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />Cecily, you will come with us.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />And so they all go off leaving the men alone. Jack tells Algernon he must leave immediately, but just then, the butler, Merriman, arrives.</p> 
 <p><strong>Merriman</strong><br />I have put Mr Ernest's things in the room next to yours, sir.&nbsp;I suppose that is all right?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />What?</p> 
 <p><strong>Merriman</strong><br />Mr Ernest's luggage, sir.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />His luggage?</p> 
 <p><strong>Merriman</strong><br />Yes, sir.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Merriman, order the carriage at once.&nbsp;Mr Ernest has been suddenly called back to London.</p> 
 <p><strong>Merriman</strong><br />Yes, sir.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />What a terrible&nbsp;<strong>liar</strong>&nbsp;you are, Jack.&nbsp;I have not been called back to London at all.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Yes, you have.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon<br /></strong>Well, I have to say, Cecily is lovely.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />You are not allowed to talk of Miss Cardew like that.&nbsp;I don't like it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Well, I don't like your clothes.&nbsp;Why don't you go and change?&nbsp;It is perfectly&nbsp;<strong>childish</strong>&nbsp;to be in&nbsp;<strong>mourning&nbsp;</strong>for a man who is&nbsp;<strong>actually</strong>&nbsp;staying in your house as a guest.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />You are certainly not staying with me as a guest or anything else.&nbsp;You are leaving... by the four-five train.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Well, I won't leave you while you are in mourning.&nbsp;It would be most unkind.&nbsp;If I was in mourning, I think it would be very unkind if you didn't stay with me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Well, will you leave if I change my clothes?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Yes, if you are not too long.&nbsp;<strong>I've never known</strong>&nbsp;anyone take so long to get dressed and with such little result.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Well,&nbsp;<strong>it's better than</strong>&nbsp;<strong>always being</strong>&nbsp;over-dressed as you are.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />If&nbsp;<strong>I am occasionally a little over-dressed</strong>, I make up for it&nbsp;<strong>by always being</strong>&nbsp;immensely over-educated.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Your&nbsp;<strong>vanity</strong>&nbsp;is ridiculous and your behaviour is an&nbsp;<strong>outrage</strong>. You have got to catch the four-five back to London.&nbsp;This Bunburying, as you call it, has not been a great success for you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Jack leaves.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />[To himself] I think it has been a great success.&nbsp;I'm in love with Cecily. I must see her before I go.&nbsp;Ah, there she is watering the flowers.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Oh, I just came back to water the roses.&nbsp;I thought you were with Uncle Jack.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />He's gone to order the carriage for me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Oh, is he going to take you for a nice drive?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />He's going to send me away.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Then have we got to say goodbye?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I'm afraid so.&nbsp;It's a very painful&nbsp;<strong>parting</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />It's always painful to part from people you have only just met. It's easy to be apart from old friends for a long time. But being apart for just a short period from someone you have just been introduced to is almost unbearable.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Thank you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Merriman</strong><br />The carriage is at the door, sir. &nbsp;</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Algernon secretly managed to find out the address of Jack's house in the country – the house where he lives with Cecily. We now join Cecily, a pretty girl of eighteen, and her&nbsp;<strong>governess</strong>&nbsp;Miss Prism – that's the lady who looks after her, in their garden on a summer's day. They're studying German grammar, but Cecily seems more interested in the flowers.</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />Cecily!&nbsp;Leave the flowers. Sit down and we'll look at the German verbs.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />But I really don't like German.</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />Cecily, you know Mr Worthing wants you to improve yourself.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Dear Uncle Jack is so serious!</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />Cecily!&nbsp;I am surprised at you.&nbsp;You know the problems Mr Worthing has. You must remember how worried he is about his&nbsp;<strong>unfortunate</strong>&nbsp;young brother.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />I wish Uncle Jack would let that unfortunate young man, his brother, come here sometimes. Oh, Miss Prism… Look who's coming… It's&nbsp;<strong>Reverend&nbsp;</strong>Chasuble.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And indeed, they hadn't noticed the middle-aged man walking up the garden because&nbsp;<strong>they</strong>&nbsp;<strong>had been</strong>&nbsp;<strong>talking&nbsp;</strong>so energetically about Jack.</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />Reverend Chasuble!&nbsp;This is a pleasure.</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />Oh, Miss Prism, I hope you are well?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Miss Prism has just been complaining of a headache.&nbsp;I think it would be good for her to have a short walk with you in the park, Reverend.</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />I haven't mentioned anything about a headache.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />No, dear Miss Prism, I know that, but I thought you&nbsp;<strong>had been looking</strong>&nbsp;like you might get one.</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />Mr Worthing, I suppose, has not returned from London yet?</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />He won't be back until Monday afternoon.</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />Ah yes, he likes spending Sunday in London.&nbsp;He's not one of those people who spend all their time enjoying themselves, not like that young man his brother.</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />I think, dear Reverend, I will have a walk with you.&nbsp;I find I have a headache after all, and a walk might do it good.</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />With pleasure, Miss Prism.</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />Cecily, you can read your economics book while I'm gone.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />So Miss Prism and Dr Chasuble wander off, leaving Cecily alone. She immediately shuts her book on economics and is about to get up when Merriman, the&nbsp;<strong>butler</strong>, arrives.</p> 
 <p><strong>Merriman</strong><br />Mr Ernest Worthing has just driven over from the station.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Uncle Jack's brother!&nbsp;Did you tell him Mr Worthing was in London?</p> 
 <p><strong>Merriman</strong><br />Yes, Miss.&nbsp;He seemed very disappointed.&nbsp;<strong>He had been hoping to&nbsp;</strong>find Mr Worthing at home and&nbsp;<strong>had been planning</strong>&nbsp;to stay the night. I mentioned that you and Miss Prism were in the garden.&nbsp;He said he would like to talk to you for a moment.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Ask him to come here.</p> 
 <p><strong>Merriman</strong><br />Yes, Miss.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />I have never met a really wicked person before.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Algernon enters looking stylish and confident.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />You are my little cousin Cecily, I'm sure.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />You are mistaken.&nbsp;I am not little.&nbsp;In fact, I believe I am unusually tall for my age.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Oh, I'm sorry…</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />But I am your cousin Cecily.&nbsp;You are Uncle Jack's brother, my cousin Ernest, my&nbsp;<strong>wicked</strong>&nbsp;cousin Ernest.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Oh! I'm not really wicked at all, cousin Cecily.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />If you aren't, then you have been&nbsp;<strong>deceiving</strong>&nbsp;us all.&nbsp;I hope you haven't been leading&nbsp;<strong>a double life</strong>, pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Oh!&nbsp;Of course I have been rather&nbsp;<strong>reckless</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />I am glad to hear it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />In fact, now you mention it, I've been very bad in my own small way.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />I don't think you should be so proud of that, though I am sure it has been very pleasant.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />It is much pleasanter being here with you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />I can't understand why you are here at all.&nbsp;Uncle Jack isn't back until Monday afternoon.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />How disappointing! I have to go back to London early on Monday morning.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Well, I think you should wait till Uncle Jack arrives.&nbsp;I know he wants to speak to you about you&nbsp;<strong>emigrating</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />About me what?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />You emigrating.&nbsp;He's gone to London to buy you some clothes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I'm not happy about Jack buying my clothes. I don't like his style of ties at all.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />I don't think you'll need ties.&nbsp;Uncle Jack is sending you to Australia.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Australia!&nbsp;I'd sooner die.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Well, he said at dinner on Wednesday night, that you would have to choose between this world, the next world, and Australia.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Oh, well!&nbsp;I haven't heard very good things about Australia or the next world. This world is good enough for me, cousin Cecily.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Yes, but are you good enough for it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I'm afraid I'm not.&nbsp;That is why you have to&nbsp;<strong>reform</strong>&nbsp;me, cousin Cecily.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />I'm sorry, I don't have time this morning.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Well, will you have time to reform me this afternoon?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />I think&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;should try.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I will, but I will need a little something to eat first. I'm a little hungry.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily<br /></strong>How thoughtless of me!&nbsp;Won't you come in for something to eat?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Thank you.&nbsp;Could I have one of your flowers first?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily<br /></strong>Certainly.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I'd like a pink rose.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />Why?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Because you are like a pink rose, cousin Cecily.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cecily</strong><br />I don't think it can be right for you to talk to me like that.&nbsp;Miss Prism never says such things to me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Then Miss Prism is a short-sighted old lady.&nbsp;You are the prettiest girl I ever saw.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Algernon and Cecily go up to the house. Miss Prism&nbsp;and&nbsp;Reverend Chasuble,&nbsp;who&nbsp;<strong>had been walking and discussing</strong>&nbsp;the advantages of marriage for single men, also return home. But someone else is now walking up the garden path. It's Jack! He's back early. He's dressed in black and looking very serious.</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />Mr Worthing! This is indeed a surprise.&nbsp;We thought you were coming back on Monday!</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />Dear Mr Worthing, I hope this black suit does not mean some terrible news?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />My brother.</p> 
 <p><strong>Miss Prism</strong><br />Spending lots of money and running up&nbsp;<strong>debts&nbsp;</strong>again?</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />Still leading his life of pleasure?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Dead!</p> 
 <p><strong>Chasuble</strong><br />Your brother Ernest, dead?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Quite dead.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Jack has asked Gwendolen to marry him. She thinks his name is Ernest, her favourite name, and has happily accepted. But her mother, Lady Bracknell, is not pleased about the engagement. She wants to ask Jack some questions about his background and finances.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell<br /></strong>Now, Mr Worthing, I am quite prepared to add your name to my list of&nbsp;<strong>eligible</strong>&nbsp;young men for my daughter if you answer my questions in a suitable way... Do you smoke?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Well, yes, I do.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell<br /></strong>I'm glad to hear it. How old are you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Twenty-nine.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br />The&nbsp;<strong>best</strong>&nbsp;age to be married in my opinion.&nbsp;What is your&nbsp;<strong>income</strong>?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Between seven and eight thousand a year.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br />Seven and eight thousand. Do you own a house?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Well, I have a country house with some land.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />A country house!&nbsp;How many bedrooms? You have a town house, I hope?&nbsp;A girl like Gwendolen could not be expected to live in the country.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Well, I own a house in Belgrave Square, but I rent it to Lady Bloxham.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell<br /></strong>Very well. Now to&nbsp;<strong>more minor</strong>&nbsp;subjects.&nbsp;Are your parents living?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />I have lost both my parents.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br />To lose one parent, Mr Worthing, is unlucky; to lose both looks like carelessness.&nbsp;Who was your father?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />I'm afraid I don't know.&nbsp;The fact is, Lady Bracknell, I said I had lost my parents.&nbsp;It would be&nbsp;<strong>more truthful</strong>&nbsp;to say that my parents lost me... I was... well, I was found.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Found!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />The&nbsp;<strong>late</strong>&nbsp;Mr Cardew, one of <strong>the</strong>&nbsp;<strong>kindest</strong>&nbsp;<strong>gentlemen</strong>&nbsp;I've ever met, found me, and gave me the name of Worthing, because he happened to have a ticket for Worthing in his pocket at the time.&nbsp;Worthing is in&nbsp;<strong>Sussex</strong>.&nbsp;It's&nbsp;<strong>the most delightful</strong>&nbsp;seaside resort...<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Where did this kind gentleman find you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />In a handbag.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />A handbag?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Yes, Lady Bracknell, I was in a handbag - a rather large, black handbag, with&nbsp;<strong>handles </strong>to it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br />And where did Mr Cardew come across this ordinary handbag?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />In the&nbsp;<strong>cloakroom</strong>&nbsp;at Victoria Station.&nbsp;It was given to him by mistake instead of his own.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />The cloakroom at Victoria Station?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Yes.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell<br /></strong>Mr Worthing, I have to say I feel rather confused by what you have just told me.&nbsp;To start life in a bag, whether it had handles or not, shows a lack of respect for family life. As for the bag being found in a cloakroom at a railway station, that isn't&nbsp;<strong>the best</strong>&nbsp;way to begin a successful life in society today.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />May I ask you then what I should do? I would do anything to&nbsp;<strong>ensure</strong>&nbsp;Gwendolen's happiness.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />I would strongly advise you, Mr Worthing, to&nbsp;<strong>acquire&nbsp;</strong>some relations as soon as possible, and to try to produce at least one parent.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Well, I don't see how I can do that.&nbsp;I can produce the bag now.&nbsp;It's at home.&nbsp;That should be enough for you, surely, Lady Bracknell.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br />Mr Worthing! You can hardly imagine that I and Lord Bracknell would allow our only daughter to&nbsp;<strong>marry into</strong>&nbsp;a cloakroom, and&nbsp;<strong>form an alliance</strong>&nbsp;with a parcel?&nbsp;Goodbye, Mr Worthing!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Goodbye!&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />How did it go? Oh, didn't it go well, old boy?&nbsp;Did Gwendolen refuse you?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Oh, as far as Gwendolen is concerned, we are engaged.&nbsp;Her mother, though, is perfectly&nbsp;<strong>unbearable</strong>.&nbsp;She's a monster... I beg your pardon, Algy, I shouldn't talk about your aunt in that way in front of you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />My dear boy, I love people being rude about my relations.&nbsp;It's the only thing that makes me&nbsp;<strong>put up with</strong>&nbsp;them.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />You don't think Gwendolen could become like her mother, do you, Algy?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Gwendolen is&nbsp;<strong>the most sensible</strong>, intellectual girl I know. But all women become like their mothers. That is their&nbsp;<strong>tragedy</strong>. By the way, did you tell Gwendolen about being Ernest in town, and Jack in the country?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />My dear fellow, the truth isn't the sort of thing you tell a nice, sweet girl.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />What about your brother?&nbsp;What about Ernest?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Oh, I shall have finished with him by the weekend.&nbsp;I'll say he died in Paris from a severe cold.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />But I thought you said that... Cecily was interested in Ernest? Won't she be very sad?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Oh, that's all right.&nbsp;Cecily is not a silly romantic girl, I am glad to say.&nbsp;She has got a good appetite, goes on long walks, and pays little attention to her lessons.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I would like to see Cecily.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />I will take very good care you never do.&nbsp;She is very pretty, and she is only just eighteen.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Have you told Gwendolen about Cecily?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Oh!&nbsp;Cecily and Gwendolen are certain to be extremely good friends.&nbsp;Half an hour after they have met, they will be calling each other 'sister'.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Women only do that when they have called each other a lot of other things first.&nbsp;Now, my dear boy, if we want to get a good table at Willis's for dinner, we must go.&nbsp;It's nearly seven.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Just then, Gwendolen comes in and tells Jack that she will always love him, even if they don't get married. She asks him for his address in the country, and Algernon - listening quietly - secretly writes it down. Jack takes Gwendolen to her carriage and Algernon is left on his own, with a smile on his face.</p> 
 <p><em>(A bell rings)</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Lane<br /></strong>You called, sir.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Tomorrow, Lane, I'm going Bunburying.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lane<br /></strong>Yes, sir.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I'm going to Hertfordshire. I shall probably not be back until Monday. You can prepare all my Bunbury clothes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lane<br /></strong>Yes, sir.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I hope tomorrow will be a fine day, Lane.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lane<br /></strong>It never is, sir.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Lane, you are a perfect pessimist.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lane<br /></strong>I do&nbsp;<strong>my best</strong>&nbsp;to give satisfaction, sir.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Algernon has just asked his good friend Jack to explain why he calls himself Jack in the country but Ernest in London. Jack says it's because he is the&nbsp;<strong>guardian</strong>&nbsp;of a girl called Cecily, who lives with him in the country. She looks up to him and he feels he should behave well when he's with her, so he pretends he has a younger brother called Ernest so that when he comes up to London, he can enjoy himself.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon<br /></strong>So, Ernest, you are a&nbsp;<strong>Bunburyist</strong>!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>What on earth do you mean?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon<br /></strong>You have invented a very useful younger brother called Ernest, so that you can come to London as often as you like.&nbsp;I have invented a sick friend called Bunbury so that I can go to the country whenever I like.&nbsp;Bunbury is&nbsp;<strong>invaluable</strong>.&nbsp;For example, if Bunbury didn't have such bad health, I would have to have dinner with my aunt Lady Bracknell tonight. And I have no intention of doing that.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>Why not?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon<br /></strong>Well, to begin with, I had dinner with her on Monday - once a week is quite enough to eat with your own relations.&nbsp;Secondly, I know&nbsp;<strong>I will be seated&nbsp;</strong>next to Mary Farquhar, who always&nbsp;<strong>flirts</strong>&nbsp;with her own husband - most unpleasant! Besides, I want to have dinner with you and talk about Bunburyism.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>I'm not a... Bunburyist.&nbsp;In fact I think I am going to kill my brother Ernest. Cecily is a little too interested in him.&nbsp;And I strongly advise you to do the same with Mr... with your sick friend.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon<br /></strong><strong>I will not be separated</strong>&nbsp;from Bunbury... &nbsp;<em>(a bell rings)</em>&nbsp;Ah! That must be my aunt now.&nbsp;Now, if I keep her busy for ten minutes so you can&nbsp;<strong>propose&nbsp;</strong>to Gwendolen, will you have dinner with me tonight?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>Alright Algy...</p> 
 <p><strong>Lane<br /></strong>Lady Augusta Bracknell and Miss Gwendolen Fairfax.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>A well-dressed, elderly woman and her daughter, a pretty, young lady enter the room.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell<br /></strong>Good afternoon, dear Algernon. Oh, hello, Mr Worthing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>Hello, Lady...</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell<br /></strong>Now, Algernon... I'd like a nice cup of tea, and one of those cucumber sandwiches you promised me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon<br /></strong>Certainly, Aunt Augusta.&nbsp;Good heavens!&nbsp;Lane!&nbsp;Why are there no cucumber sandwiches?</p> 
 <p><strong>Lane<br /></strong>There were no cucumbers in the market this morning, sir.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon<br /></strong>No cucumbers!</p> 
 <p><strong>Lane<br /></strong>No, sir.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon<br /></strong>I am very sorry, Aunt Augusta.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell<br /></strong>It doesn't matter, Algernon.&nbsp;Pour me some tea.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon<br /></strong>Here you are.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell<br /></strong>Thank you.&nbsp;Now, Algernon, about tonight -&nbsp;<strong>you</strong>&nbsp;<strong>will be seated</strong>&nbsp;next to Mary Farquhar.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon<br /></strong>I'm afraid, Aunt Augusta, I won't be able to have dinner with you tonight.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell<br /></strong>But why not, Algernon?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon<br /></strong>Well, I have just heard that my poor friend Bunbury is very ill again. I'll have to go and see him.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell<br /></strong>It's very strange.&nbsp;This Mr Bunbury seems to have curiously bad health. I think it is time that he made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die. And I would be very grateful if you could ask Mr Bunbury to please not be ill on Saturday, because I need you to organise my music at my&nbsp;<strong>soir&eacute;e</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon<br /></strong>I'll speak to him, Aunt Augusta, and I'm sure he'll be well by Saturday. But why don't we go next door to look at the programme of music I've prepared.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell<br /></strong>Thank you, Algernon.&nbsp;It is very thoughtful of you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Algernon and his aunt go into the music room, leaving Jack and Gwendolen alone.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>It has been a lovely day, Miss Fairfax.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen<br /></strong>Please don't talk to me about the weather, Mr Worthing.&nbsp;Whenever people talk about the weather, I am sure they mean something else.&nbsp;And that makes me nervous.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>I do mean something else.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen<br /></strong>I thought so.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>Miss Fairfax, ever since I met you I have admired you...</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen<br /></strong>Yes, I realised that.&nbsp;Actually, I<strong>&nbsp;have always been fascinated&nbsp;</strong>by you... even before we met. &nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>Really?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen<br /></strong>Yes, I've always wanted to love someone called Ernest.&nbsp;That name&nbsp;<strong>inspires</strong>&nbsp;complete confidence.&nbsp;When Algernon first mentioned that he had a friend called Ernest, I knew&nbsp;I was<strong> destined&nbsp;</strong>to love you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>You really love me, Gwendolen?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen<br /></strong><strong>Passionately</strong>!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>But you don't really mean that you couldn't love me if my name wasn't Ernest?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen<br /></strong>But your name&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;Ernest.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>Yes, I know.&nbsp;But what if it was something else?&nbsp;Do you mean you couldn't love me then? Personally, I don't think the name suits me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen<br /></strong>It suits you perfectly.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>But there are lots of other much nicer names.&nbsp;Jack, for instance, is a charming name.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen<br /></strong>Jack? Oh, no, Jack does not have the same sound at all. It's not exciting. The only really safe name is Ernest.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>Gwendolen,&nbsp;<strong>I must get christened&nbsp;</strong>at once - I mean, we must get married at once.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen<br /></strong>Married, Mr Worthing?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>Well... surely.&nbsp;You know that I love you, and you led me to believe, Miss Fairfax, that you felt the same.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen<br /></strong>I adore you.&nbsp;But you haven't proposed to me yet.&nbsp;<strong>Nothing has been said</strong>&nbsp;at all about marriage.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack<br /></strong>Well... may I propose to you now?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And so Jack&nbsp;<strong>kneels</strong>&nbsp;down and asks Gwendolen to marry him. She accepts and Jack is still on his knees when Lady Bracknell returns.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell<br /></strong>Mr Worthing! Do get up!&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen<br /></strong>Mamma!&nbsp;Please leave us.&nbsp;Mr Worthing has not quite finished yet.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell<br /></strong>Finished what, may I ask?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen<br /></strong><strong>I am engaged</strong>&nbsp;to Mr Worthing, mamma.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Lady Bracknell<br /></strong>Pardon me, you are not engaged to anyone.&nbsp;When you do become engaged, I, or your father will tell you.&nbsp;<strong>A young girl should be surprised</strong>&nbsp;by an engagement, pleasantly or unpleasantly. It is not something that&nbsp;<strong>she is allowed</strong>&nbsp;to arrange for herself... And now I would like to ask you a few questions, Mr Worthing.&nbsp;Gwendolen, can you wait for me below in the carriage.</p> 
 <p><strong>Gwendolen<br /></strong>Mamma!</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Algernon Moncrieff, a wealthy young man from the upper classes of society, is passing the time playing the piano in his luxurious flat in central London. He's waiting for his aunt and cousin to&nbsp;come to&nbsp;tea. Algernon is a well-dressed and pleasant-looking man. His servant, Lane, is busy preparing the table.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Did you hear what I was playing, Lane?</p> 
 <p><strong>Lane</strong><br />I thought it would be rude to listen, sir.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Oh, that's a pity. Now, have you made the cucumber sandwiches yet for Lady Bracknell?&nbsp;<strong>They said they would be here at five.</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Lane</strong><br />Yes, sir. Here they are.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Oh! Good… By the way, Lane, I noticed eight bottles of champagne were drunk on Thursday night while I was having dinner with Mr Worthing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lane</strong><br />That's correct, sir.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Why do&nbsp;<strong>bachelors'</strong>&nbsp;servants always drink their champagne?</p> 
 <p><strong>Lane</strong><br />It's probably because a bachelor's wine is better than the wine you'd find in married families.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Good heavens! Is marriage as bad as that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Lane</strong><br /><strong>People tell me that it is very pleasant, sir</strong>. I don't have much experience. I've only been married once.</p> 
 <p><em>(a bell rings)</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Aha! That will be my dear aunt, Lady Bracknell…&nbsp;<strong>Tell her that I'm in the morning room</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />But it isn't Algernon's aunt. It's a young gentleman who follows Lane into the room. He's good-looking and has a serious expression on his face. Algernon is pleased, though surprised, to see him.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lane</strong><br />Mr Ernest Worthing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />How are you, my dear Ernest? What brings you to London?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Oh, pleasure of course!</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Where have you been since last Thursday?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />In the country.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br /><strong>What on earth</strong>&nbsp;do you do there?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />When you are in town you entertain yourself. When you are in the country you entertain other people. It is really quite boring.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />And who do you entertain?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Oh, neighbours.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Got nice neighbours where you live in&nbsp;<strong>Shropshire</strong>?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br /><strong>Perfectly horrid</strong>! Never speak to any of them.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />They must find you very entertaining, then!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Hello! Why all these cups? Why cucumber sandwiches? Who's coming to tea?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Oh! Just my aunt Lady Bracknell and… her daughter Gwendolen…</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />How wonderful!</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Yes, but Lady Bracknell won't&nbsp;<strong>approve</strong>&nbsp;of you being here.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Why not?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />My dear&nbsp;<strong>fellow</strong>, the way you&nbsp;<strong>flirt</strong>&nbsp;with Gwendolen is perfectly disgraceful. It's almost as bad as the way Gwendolen flirts with you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />I'm in love with Gwendolen. I've come to London to ask her to marry me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br /><strong>You told me you had come here for pleasure</strong>? I call that business.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />You are so unromantic!</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I really don't see anything romantic in&nbsp;<strong>proposing</strong>. It's very romantic to be in love. But there's nothing romantic about asking someone to marry you. They may accept you. Then the excitement is all over. If I ever get married, I'll certainly try to forget that I am.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />I'm sure you will, dear Algy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I don't think you will ever marry Gwendolen.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Why on earth do you say that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Well, in the first place, girls never marry the men they flirt with.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Oh, that's nonsense!</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />It's true. It explains why there are so many bachelors. In the second place, I won't give you my permission.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Your permission?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />My dear fellow, Gwendolen is my first cousin, and before I allow you to marry her, you will have to explain about… Cecily.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Cecily? What do you mean? Who is Cecily? I don't know any one called Cecily.</p> 
 <p>(A bell rings)</p> 
 <p><strong>Lane</strong><br />You called, sir?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Bring me that cigarette case Mr Worthing left here last Thursday.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lane</strong><br />Yes, sir.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Have you had my cigarette case all this time? I wish you'd told me. I've been to the police. I nearly offered a large reward.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Well, I wish you would. I'm quite&nbsp;<strong>hard up</strong>&nbsp;at the moment.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />There's no point offering a large reward now it's been found.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lane</strong><br />The cigarette case, sir.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />I think that's rather mean of you, Ernest. However, it's not important now because according to the&nbsp;<strong>inscription</strong>&nbsp;inside, the case isn't yours anyway.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Of course it's mine. You've seen me use it hundreds of times. Now, could I have my cigarette case back?</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Yes, but this isn't your cigarette case. It's a present from someone called Cecily, and you said you didn't know anyone of that name.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Well, actually, Cecily is my aunt.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Your aunt!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Yes. Lovely old lady she is, too. Lives in Tunbridge Wells.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />But why does she call herself &quot;little Cecily&quot; if she is your aunt? &quot;From little Cecily with her&nbsp;<strong>fondest</strong>&nbsp;love.&quot;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />What's wrong with that? Some aunts are tall, some are small.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Yes. But why does your aunt call you her uncle? &quot;From little Cecily, with her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack.&quot; There is no problem, I admit, to an aunt being small, but why should an aunt call her own nephew… uncle? Besides, your name isn't Jack. It's Ernest.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />It isn't Ernest. It's Jack.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />You have always told me it was Ernest. I have introduced you to everyone as Ernest. You look as if your name was Ernest. You are the most&nbsp;<strong>earnest</strong>-looking person I ever saw in my life – so honest and serious.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Ah yes, we should just say that the name Ernest was very common at the time, and the adjective 'earnest' – which sounds exactly the same - means, well, honest and serious.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Here, it's written on your card: &quot;Mr Ernest Worthing, B4, The Albany.&quot;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jack</strong><br />Well, my name is Ernest in town and Jack in the country, and the cigarette case was given to me in the country.</p> 
 <p><strong>Algernon</strong><br />Yes, but that doesn't explain why your small Aunt Cecily calls you her dear uncle. Or why you have two names to start with. Come on, you'll have to explain.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>The Vicar of Altarnum has just told me he knows who murdered my uncle and aunt. I look at him in&nbsp;<strong>horror</strong>, and slowly, the awful truth becomes clear...</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Yes, Mary. I planned the&nbsp;<strong>wrecks</strong>. Your uncle followed my&nbsp;<strong>orders&nbsp;</strong>but they thought&nbsp;<em>he</em>&nbsp;was the leader. He loved that. No one knew about me. But then you came and asked questions.&nbsp;<strong>They had to die because of that</strong>... The end was near in any case. The fool got drunk on Christmas Eve. Well, you saw what happened... the whole country knew what he'd done. With a rope round his neck, he'd have told them about me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>At least my uncle didn't lie - he talked and dreamt about his crimes. You... you hid yours behind the cross and the face of a priest. But why are you telling me all this now?</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>I know you found the picture... I saw it had been moved. It frightened you, didn't it? &quot;Who is this strange man?&quot; you thought. Yes, Mary I am strange. Oh, but they listened to me in church and followed me like sheep.</p> 
 <p>Now, get ready. We've got to leave.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>We?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Yes, you're coming with me - you'll be a good&nbsp;<strong>companion</strong>. I've admired your courage since we first met.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>And if I don't come with you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>You're no fool, Mary. There are no houses nearby and your screams won't be heard.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>You know that I'll run away at the first village.</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>You won't be able to.&nbsp;<strong>There aren't any villages on the Cornish coast because of the steep cliffs</strong>... just birds, and when we're on the ship...</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>You're leaving England?</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Of course - we'll go to Spain, to Africa... Get ready now.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>I think quickly. I look at the clock... Jem will have reached the&nbsp;<strong>blacksmith</strong>&nbsp;and will know the truth.&nbsp;<strong>He'll realise I'm in serious danger so he will follow us</strong>... If I go with the vicar, at least I'll slow him down a bit, so Jem will have a chance to catch up...</p> 
 <p>I have no choice in any case.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
 <p>We cross the dark, empty moor quickly, avoiding the roads. The moon is hidden behind clouds... The Vicar has luck on his side.</p> 
 <p>As the ground becomes softer, we slow down... The&nbsp;<strong>marshes</strong>&nbsp;lie waiting. The Vicar knows, as I do, that&nbsp;<strong>one wrong step will result in a horrible death</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oh, where is Jem?</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Whoah! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>A wall of fog rises in front of us.</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>It's no good. We can't see anything. We'll have to wait until light. We'll sleep here... on these rocks, out of the wind.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>I&nbsp;<strong>drift in and out</strong>&nbsp;of sleep.</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Shhh! Be quiet!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>I'm woken by his cold hand on my mouth.</p> 
 <p>I can still hear the wind, but there is something else, too...</p> 
 <p>We leave the horses and he&nbsp;<strong>drags&nbsp;</strong>me higher and higher...</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I can't go any further.</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Stay here, then.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>The last I see of him - he's standing on a rock with his arms stretched out...</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>(gunshot) Aaaah!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>I look up. Jem is about 100 metres away behind a rock with a gun.</p> 
 <p>I haven't seen Jem since he shot the vicar. The Bassat family have been looking after me. They've asked me to stay and look after their children... but I&nbsp;<strong>long for</strong>&nbsp;the green fields and valleys of Helford. I'm walking for the last time on the moor. Tomorrow I'll go back and live quietly on the farm.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Someone is coming this way... but I can't see who because the sun is in my eyes...</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Hello Mary. I heard you're going to go and live at North Hill?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>They've asked me, but no... I'm going back to Helford tomorrow... And you, are you leaving Cornwall?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Yes, I'm going to start a new life... I've got my whole home with me here. I may go north. Perhaps I'll&nbsp;<strong>breed</strong>&nbsp;horses instead of stealing them. Come with me, Mary.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I miss my home in Helford... I want to see the trees and animals...</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Go then and live on your farm.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>That's not very kind.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>I speak unkindly to my horses when they're&nbsp;<strong>obstinate</strong>. it doesn't mean I don't love them. Well, I'll be on my way... Goodbye Mary.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Wait! Are you saying you love me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Maybe... It'll be a hard life.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I know, I'll take my chance... and we'll be together.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>So, I cross the moor for the last time - and for the first time, it looks beautiful in the sunshine. Behind me lies Jamaica Inn, empty, no more secrets - they have all been told... my new life is about to begin.</p>

"<p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>I'm at the Vicar's house. I'm here because last night, when I returned to the inn, I found my uncle – dead... lying on the floor with a knife in his back. When Mr Bassat arrived with his men, they found my aunt's body upstairs... she'd also been&nbsp;<strong>stabbed</strong>.</p> 
 <p>The vicar suggested I stay with him. He came to the inn as soon as he read my note. He's not here. He left before I woke up.</p> 
 <p>While I've been waiting for him, I've been thinking about who the killer could be. Mr Bassat asked me if I had an idea who it was. I told him I didn't... but that's not true... I remember how Jem told me that he hated his brother... so they'll catch and hang him... or else he'll ride away, laughing at me. Either way, I know that I love him.</p> 
 <p>Strange how this room is so empty... No books, no paintings... Not like the vicar's house in Helford where I lived with my mother... His living room had pictures of smiling angels and village scenes... and piles of books on the desk.</p> 
 <p>There's nothing on this desk. I know... I'll write and ask if I can stay with him. Now, where's a pen and paper? Ah... in this drawer perhaps. That's&nbsp;<strong>odd!&nbsp;</strong>Nothing in the drawer, wait, there&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a piece of paper... oh but it's already got something on it... a picture – by the vicar &shy;&shy;– his initials are there. What a strange picture.</p> 
 <p>It makes me&nbsp;<strong>shiver</strong>... It's the village church with the vicar and his&nbsp;<strong>congregation</strong>... but all the people have got sheep's heads and look stupid. The vicar has drawn himself as a wolf but not an ordinary wolf, a laughing wolf... What does it mean...? Oh no! He's back... quick! I shut the drawer quickly and sit by the fire. I'm shaking.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oh, Vicar...</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Did I&nbsp;<strong>startle</strong>&nbsp;you? I'm sorry I was so long. My horse was&nbsp;<strong>lame</strong>. You must be hungry?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>I find it difficult to speak... The picture has shocked me. The vicar asks me to get the food from the kitchen. When I return, there are papers all over the desk. He's been burning letters.</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Don't you want to know what I've been doing today?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I'm sorry - I haven't thanked you for your kindness last night.&nbsp;<strong>If you hadn't taken me in, I wouldn't have had anywhere to stay.</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Well... I've been to North Hill. Mr Bassat invited me and others to discuss the murder.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Does Mr Bassat&nbsp;<strong>suspect</strong>&nbsp;anyone?</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>They've found the man, Harry... He can't be the murderer though.&nbsp;<strong>He would have been a suspect if he hadn't been locked up in the room by the bar for the last few days.</strong>&nbsp;But he said that someone else gave your uncle orders. This person must be the murderer. Don't you agree?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Well... er... Yes, I suppose...</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>It can't be one of the men. This person is clever. He must have come to the inn and he knows the moor well. He probably lives nearby. Did anyone like this come to the inn?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Er... no... I can't think...&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Why do you look so anxious, Mary? But I forgot... I saw a friend of yours today at North Hill.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I have no friends except you...</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>But you told me you went to Launceston with your uncle's brother...</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>I froze... I didn't know what to say...</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>He gave me a message for you. Tell her that &quot;I'm sorry&quot;. I...</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Jem was at North Hill? Why?</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Well, he's the dead man's brother. He wasn't upset, though...</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Was Mr Bassat asking him questions?</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>They've been talking all day. He's got brains - more than his brother. You told me he lives nearby, and steals horses?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>I can't look at him, but I feel his eyes studying my face... He knows the truth.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>What will they do to him, Mr Davey?</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>'Do'? What do you mean? I'm sure he won't be punished since he has helped them.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>'Helped'? I don't understand.</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Mary, it was Jem who&nbsp;<strong>informed</strong>&nbsp;Mr Bassat about his own brother. They left Launceston together after the horse market. Mr Bassat told him he could go free if he gave them&nbsp;<strong>proof&nbsp;</strong>about his brother and he did.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>I can't believe it... I was so sure...</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oh, Vicar, I'm such a fool... Where is Jem now?</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>He's gone to find the&nbsp;<strong>blacksmith</strong>... He found a&nbsp;<strong>nail</strong>&nbsp;in the field by the inn. It must belong to the killer's horse. Only one person went to the blacksmith yesterday...</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>How do you know?</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Because I know who that person was.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>His strange eyes are staring at me... I can't breathe! He knows who the murderer is!</p> 
 <p>Meet me in the next episode when I finally discover the shocking truth about who killed my aunt and uncle at Jamaica Inn. I am also in danger but who will come to my rescue?</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>My uncle is planning our escape from Jamaica Inn tonight. He's afraid that someone is coming to kill him – someone who has been giving him the orders to&nbsp;<strong>wreck&nbsp;</strong>ships. He thinks I'm resting in my room and he has locked my door. But I climbed out of the window and am&nbsp;<strong>hurrying</strong>&nbsp;to the vicar's house before my uncle discovers I've gone. The vicar will help me, I'm sure …</p> 
 <p>Ah there's the church and the&nbsp;<strong>vicarage.</strong>&nbsp;I can't see any lights, though.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Mr Davey… Mr Davey… It's Mary … Mary Yellan. No one's here…</p> 
 <p>Excuse me, is the vicar in the church? I've been knocking at the house but there's no answer.</p> 
 <p><strong>Woman<br /></strong>No, he left this morning and won't be back until tomorrow.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Are you sure? Oh… what shall I do?... I've got to find someone to help me…</p> 
 <p><strong>Woman<br /></strong>Why don't you go to Mr Bassat, the&nbsp;<strong>magistrate?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;He lives at North Hill, but it's four miles away.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I'll have to go there…But first… I must … write … a note for Mr Davey. Here… can you give this to him…?</p> 
 <p><strong>Woman<br /></strong>But you can't walk! – it's getting dark …</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong>&nbsp;<strong>narrating<br /></strong>In my note, I explained about the wreck and my uncle's plan to escape… I'll have to walk quickly to North Hill. If my uncle discovers I've gone, he'll know I've&nbsp;<strong>betrayed</strong>&nbsp;him and he'll kill me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I need to see Mr Bassat –&nbsp;<strong>it's urgent!</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Mrs Bassat<br /></strong>I'm afraid he's not here.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oh no!… If I don't see him, something&nbsp;<strong>terrible</strong>&nbsp;will happen!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mrs Bassat<br /></strong>It's not about the horses is it? … I know one was&nbsp;<strong>quite ill</strong>&nbsp;this morning…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>No … When will Mr Bassat be back?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mrs Bassat<br /></strong>I really don't know.&nbsp;<strong>Actually</strong>, I'm very&nbsp;<strong>worried</strong>. He knows a man called Joss Merlyn who's&nbsp;<strong>very dangerous</strong>, so he might be in&nbsp;<strong>serious</strong>&nbsp;danger.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>What do you mean?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mrs Bassat<br /></strong>My husband has&nbsp;<strong>suspected</strong>&nbsp;for a long time that's he committed&nbsp;<strong>serious</strong>&nbsp;crimes and this morning, he&nbsp;<strong>suddenly</strong>&nbsp;got&nbsp;<strong>proof</strong>. He's gone to Launceston to get men and will surround the Inn this evening… there may be fighting…but do you know this man Merlyn? Wait a moment…you are the girl my husband told me about, aren't you? Don't move…!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Don't… I won't hurt you… I came to tell Mr Bassat that my uncle is planning to escape tonight. But I've&nbsp;<strong>ruined</strong>&nbsp;your husband's plan. When my uncle sees I'm not in my room, he'll leave before your husband gets there…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mrs Bassat<br /></strong>I can see you're telling the truth. How can I help you…?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I must go back and help my aunt. I'm&nbsp;<strong>really</strong>&nbsp;worried about her… [puzzled and trying to work out] But how did Mr Bassat find out the truth so soon?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mrs Bassat<br /></strong>I've no idea.&nbsp;<strong>He left very suddenly</strong>&nbsp;… But you can't possibly walk back&nbsp;<strong>alone</strong>&nbsp;now – it's&nbsp;<strong>dark.</strong>&nbsp;Our servant, James, will&nbsp;<strong>see you home safely.</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Really … there's no need. I'm used to the roads at night…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>But she insisted… so I am once again on the road to Jamaica Inn. The moor is&nbsp;<strong>cold&nbsp;</strong>and still tonight… James has two guns and if I have to … I'll use one… There is the inn …</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>It looks like Mr Bassat hasn't got&nbsp;<strong>here yet</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;I must find my aunt… Perhaps they've&nbsp;<strong>already&nbsp;</strong>gone. I'll go in&nbsp;<strong>alone</strong>. Give me a gun James. If you hear a shot, then come.</p> 
 <p><strong>Strange</strong>… the house is dark… but the horses are still here. So they haven't gone yet! Unless they went&nbsp;<strong>on foot</strong>, but no… my aunt wouldn't have done that. How odd!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>The kitchen is&nbsp;<strong>empty.</strong>&nbsp;The fire is&nbsp;<strong>dead</strong>.&nbsp;Nothing but&nbsp;<strong>a deathly silence</strong>. I&nbsp;<strong>creep</strong>&nbsp;to the hall, terrified of meeting my uncle with a gun. [gasps!]</p> 
 <p><strong>A terrible sight</strong>&nbsp;is there before me… I turn and run&nbsp;<strong>as fast as I can</strong>…</p> 
 <p>Let's meet again in the next episode – after the shocking events of today I go to the&nbsp;<strong>safety&nbsp;</strong>of the vicar's house – he has&nbsp;<strong>something important</strong>&nbsp;to tell me, but what can it be?</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>It's morning…I have just woken up in my bed in Jamaica Inn. Memories of what I saw on Christmas Eve&nbsp;<strong>haunt&nbsp;</strong>me like a&nbsp;<strong>nightmare</strong>&nbsp;…</p> 
 <p>My uncle forced me to travel with him and his drunken men on Christmas Eve. I was so tired on the journey that while they were singing drunken songs, I fell asleep.</p> 
 <p><strong>When I woke up, they had gone</strong>. The carriage doors were locked, but I escaped through the window.</p> 
 <p><strong>They had brought me to the coast.</strong>&nbsp;It was a cold,&nbsp;<strong>misty</strong>&nbsp;night, but from where I was standing on the clifftop, I could see my uncle and his&nbsp;<strong>gang</strong>&nbsp;below on the shore, silent and still. They were watching the&nbsp;<strong>tide</strong>&nbsp;coming in, like a beast waiting to&nbsp;<strong>pounce</strong>.</p> 
 <p>The mist began to clear and a light appeared on a nearby cliff. At last!&nbsp;<strong>The officers the vicar had spoken about were coming!</strong>&nbsp;… But my hope disappeared quickly. &nbsp;… Another light appeared out at sea. This one was moving up and down… I realised then with horror what was happening. The light on the cliff was a&nbsp;<strong>trap</strong>!</p> 
 <p>A huge black shape appeared out of the darkness. Like a&nbsp;<strong>moth</strong>&nbsp;to a candle, the ship was heading for the rocks…</p> 
 <p>I remember now how I ran to the shore, how I screamed and shouted… but my uncle caught me and tied my hands so I couldn't move. I couldn't do anything except watch the disaster happen.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>The men splashed about in the water grabbing<strong>&nbsp;treasures that had fallen</strong>&nbsp;from the ship<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Bodies were floating on the water. The men fell on them and took everything of value … even rings on the fingers. Hours passed. Light was appearing in the sky. My uncle saw it too.</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Whoah!! … Stop everyone! Look!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>He pointed to the sky.</p> 
 <p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>Just … going …&nbsp;to get …</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Leave it! … There's no time!… It's getting light … Get out of here!… … before it's too late.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>But no one was listening. They were greedily grabbing what they could.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong><strong>My uncle had fired his pistol</strong>&nbsp;in the air. The men looked up and saw the sky. Fear struck them and they ran up the beach, carrying what they could… They knew they had stayed too long. Morning was their enemy. … I was too weak to move, but my uncle picked me up and carried me… In the&nbsp;<strong>panic</strong>, the carriage overturned. That meant there was only one small cart for everyone's escape.</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Stand back!… I say stand back!…Harry, make sure no one moves… Shoot if necessary… I said…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>There was blood everywhere…two men lay still… I&nbsp;<strong>fainted</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>Mary, are you awake?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>How long have I been lying here?</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>Two days.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Why didn't you wake me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>Mary…I…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I've got to get up …</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>Where are you going? Your uncle is downstairs.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>He doesn't frighten me… I must go and find….</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>He's never been like this before. He's locked all the doors. He's afraid of someone … I don't know who…</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>Don't go down, Mary, he's got a gun…!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>All the doors and windows are&nbsp;<strong>bolted</strong>. My uncle is sitting in the kitchen…</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>I heard noises outside. Did you hear anything?...</p> 
 <p>He'll come… He warned me but I didn't listen…We didn't plan it this time.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>What do you mean? Who warned you? The officers?</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Them…? They can't touch me. They need&nbsp;<strong>proof</strong>&nbsp;and all they have is a broken ship and two bodies. I wasn't there, was I&nbsp; – I was at home with my wife and niece cosy by the fire… No, it's him… He'll murder us all…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I don't understand. My uncle planned the wrecks, didn't he… or did he? Was there someone else who gave the orders? Who is he so afraid of?</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>Why don't we get away quickly now?</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>You idiot! There are people everywhere who know what I've done. They'd like to see me hang … we'll stay till night time, when it's dark… We'll leave then!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>I go along with my uncle's plan, but in my mind I'm making other plans – I'll escape somehow and find the vicar…. He's my only hope....</p> 
 <p>Meet me in the next episode when things get even worse and I make a shocking discovery that will completely change my life at Jamaica Inn.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>I've hardly slept since my uncle's shocking&nbsp;<strong>confession</strong>&nbsp;- how he&nbsp;<strong>lures&nbsp;</strong>ships onto the rocks and drowns women and children. Today, however, I have escaped and am on my way with Jem to the horse market in Launceston.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem&nbsp;<br /></strong>It's Christmas Eve, Mary. Why so quiet? What's happened?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary&nbsp;<br /></strong>Nothing…</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>You look tired.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>My uncle has been drinking… and talking… I know about the&nbsp;<strong>wrecks,&nbsp;</strong>Jem.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>And you think&nbsp;<strong>I must be involved</strong>…?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>There are gaps in the story and you fit into them…</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem&nbsp;<br /></strong>So you think I watch men and women drown and then steal from their dead bodies? … I may have taken some&nbsp;<strong>tobacco</strong>&nbsp;sometimes from the inn… but I've never killed a man…&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>Can I believe him?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>If you don't believe me, why have you come with me today?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I like your bright eyes…<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Mrs Bassat<br /></strong>Look, James! That pony looks just like Beauty, except Beauty was grey… How much is she?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem&nbsp;<br /></strong>She's not for sale. I promised her to a friend.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mrs Bassat<br /></strong>How much does your friend want?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>30&nbsp;<strong>guineas</strong>.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mrs Bassatt<br /></strong>Well, I'm Mrs Bassat. I'd like to buy her for my children for Christmas. I'll give you 35.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>OK. She's yours.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mrs Bassat<br /></strong>Here... My man James will ride her home…&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem and Mary<br /></strong>[laughing…]&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Jem Merlyn, you should be ashamed!&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Quick Mary, stand under here… I'll keep you warm… We'll get&nbsp;<strong>soaked</strong>&nbsp;if we go back tonight. Stay with me in Launceston tonight.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>No, I've been&nbsp;<strong>foolish</strong>&nbsp;enough today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Alright… I'll get the horse… Wait here.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary&nbsp;<br /></strong>He is rude, a thief and a liar.&nbsp;<strong>He might even be a murderer</strong>. And yet, if he wasn't so much like his brother, I could fall in love with him…<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Mary&nbsp;<br /></strong>Where is he? He left over 30 minutes ago… I'll ask that horse seller over there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Excuse me, have you seen Jem Merlyn?</p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>The man with the black pony? I saw him with another man. They left in a&nbsp;<strong>carriage</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary&nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh no!&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>Did they discover that the pony was stolen? Now I'm sorry I didn't agree to stay in Launceston with him… He went to get the horse to take me home… and now he's gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary&nbsp;<br /></strong>What shall I do? Perhaps someone will let me sleep on their floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Hello Mary. What are you doing here on Christmas Eve?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oh, Vicar, it's you…&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Come, I'll take you home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>Once again I tell him my story … the market, Jem's disappearance… His glass eyes show no expression…&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>You are young… don't cry over him…&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Am I right that it's quiet at Jamaica Inn…?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>My uncle has been drinking. He talks… Vicar, do you know what&nbsp;<strong>wreckers</strong>&nbsp;are?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>I tell him what my uncle told me – about using lights to bring ships onto the rocks … the dead women and children… the stolen&nbsp;<strong>cargo</strong>…&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar</strong>&nbsp;<br />So your uncle talks when he is drunk, does he? … Well there won't be any more wrecks. The government is putting officers on the coast to keep watch.</p> 
 <p>I'll get off here. The driver will take you home. Goodnight, Mary.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary&nbsp;<br /></strong>What's happening…?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>A gun is pointing at me. I see a face I recognise – the eyes look crazy and mad…&nbsp;<strong>it can only be one person</strong>…&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss&nbsp;<br /></strong>Get out! Ahh, so you've come back! What do you think you're doing at this time of night… on the road! Been with a man, I suppose.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary&nbsp;<br /></strong>Don't touch me! You're a murderer and a thief and I've been to Launceston today to&nbsp;<strong>inform</strong>&nbsp;on you.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Get back, you fools! She's lying… Get the horse Harry. The wind has changed… We'll use it…</p> 
 <p>So, Mary, you think you can inform on me so I'll hang…</p> 
 <p>You're coming with us!&nbsp;<strong>We might not get far</strong>&nbsp;but we won't stay here waiting to be caught! Away!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>Where we are going, I don't know. But I can see from the look in my uncle's eyes that something very bad is going to happen.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Join me next time – and find out exactly how bad things get when I discover what Joss and his gang of bad men really get up to.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>There was nothing but a few&nbsp;<strong>sacks</strong>&nbsp;and the rope in the locked room. My uncle has returned and is very angry about Mr Bassat's visit. He&nbsp;<strong>storms</strong>&nbsp;<strong>out</strong>&nbsp;of the house and sets off across the moor. Suddenly I have a mad plan. I put on my shoes and follow him.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>He's walking too fast. I can't keep up. It's no good - he's disappeared! It's getting dark. I must go back… Do I go right or left here? I don't remember this stream… Oh no! I'm totally lost!</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Hello, what are you doing out on the moor?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I'm lost.</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Where are you going?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Jamaica Inn.</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>That's the other side of the moor - but you're&nbsp;<strong>exhausted</strong>! Come back with me. You can rest and I'll take you back.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />You're very kind.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>He looks strange. His hair is white, and his eyes are pale. His voice is young, though.</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>I'm Francis Davey, Vicar of Altarnun. Please, come.</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Are you feeling better now?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Yes, thank you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>He has white hair and his eyes are like a blind man's – and yet his voice is gentle.</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>It was lucky I ran into you. Why were you on the moor tonight?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>Suddenly I want to tell him everything.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>It's terrible! You've probably heard&nbsp;<strong>rumours.</strong>&nbsp;They come at night, with their wagons. That first night there were six or seven of them. They brought huge boxes -&nbsp;they put them in a room by the bar. A man was killed -&nbsp;I saw the rope! Oh! What have I done? I shouldn't have said anything!</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Don't worry –&nbsp;<strong>I won't tell anyone if you don't want me to</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>But what should I do?</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>Wait. Watch your uncle.&nbsp;<strong>When the wagons come, tell me immediately</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>What about the man who was killed? Can't we do something about that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>I think not.&nbsp;<strong>If there was a body, the police would surely investigate</strong>&nbsp;– but that's unlikely now. Could it be your imagination? All you saw was a piece of rope.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I heard my uncle&nbsp;<strong>threaten</strong>&nbsp;him.</p> 
 <p><strong>Vicar<br /></strong>People threaten others every day. Listen: you can talk to me any time.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>He drives me home. My uncle has been drinking. He stays drunk for five days. Today it's sunny, so I am out on the moor again.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Where do these&nbsp;<strong>ponies</strong>&nbsp;come from?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Hey! Mary!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oh, hello!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>I didn't expect you so soon!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I didn't plan to come this way.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>So what's been happening at Jamaica Inn?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>We had a visit from Mr Bassat.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Did you now? How much do you know Mary?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I just want to get my aunt away. Your brother can drink himself to death for all I care.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>So the smuggling doesn't shock you? What about murder, though?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I don't know what you mean.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Why are you so silent, Mary? Even a child would know something was going on at Jamaica Inn. 'We're bad, us Merlyns - and Jem is the worst.' Is that what you're thinking?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Something like that, but I'm not afraid of you.&nbsp;<strong>I'd even like you if you didn't remind me of your brother</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>I'm better looking!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I must get back.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Are you coming with me to Launceston on Christmas Eve? I want to sell this pony.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong><strong>And if you're caught selling a stolen pony, I'll go to prison like you.</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>I won't be caught. Come, don't you like a bit of excitement?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Well... where shall we meet?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>It's late when I get back and my uncle is lying drunk in the kitchen, surrounded by empty bottles. My aunt is in bed.</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Who's there? Put away that knife!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Uncle Joss, it's me, Mary.</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Mary - where are they?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>There's no one here. What's wrong, Uncle Joss?</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>They can't hurt me now. They're all dead. Sit by me, Mary…&nbsp;It's this drink! I've killed men with my own hands. But&nbsp;<strong>when I'm drunk I'm afraid.</strong>&nbsp;I see them in my dreams, floating on the water... The ship: it was on the rocks but the water was flat and they were coming into the shore alive! We had to kill them all. One woman – she was holding on to some wood with her child. The water was only up to her shoulder. She cried out to me to help her: I took a stone and smashed her with it. I watched her and her child&nbsp;<strong>drown</strong>&nbsp;in four feet of water. We killed them all with stones and rocks.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>My blood turns cold, and I feel sick. My uncle is a murderer&nbsp;- that I suspected, but what he has just told me&nbsp;<strong>chills me to the bone.&nbsp;</strong>What terrible crime will he carry out next?</p> 
 <p>Join me in the next episode when I go to the horse market with Jem, but things don't go to plan.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>I now know that my uncle is involved in smuggling. I also&nbsp;<strong>suspect</strong>&nbsp;that he has murdered a man. But if I tell, my aunt will suffer, so I can't do anything. Today, I am alone cleaning the kitchen. But the quiet does not last...</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Who can that be?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator</strong><br />When I go in the bar, there's a man with a glass of beer. He looks familiar…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>What do you think you're doing? You can't help yourself to drink!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Are you the barmaid?&nbsp;<strong>Fill up</strong>&nbsp;my glass.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong><strong>Fill it up</strong>&nbsp;yourself. I'll tell Mr Merlyn you are here.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Don't&nbsp;<strong>bother -&nbsp;</strong>he won't want to see me…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Well, I can't stand here waiting.&nbsp;<strong>Pay up</strong>&nbsp;and you can go.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Do you order Joss around like that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>He's my uncle. Patience was my mother's sister. Now, I have work to do… uncle!</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Who the hell are you talking to? I told you to keep your mouth shut! Oh, it's you, Jem. What do you want? You can&nbsp;<strong>get on with</strong>&nbsp;your work, Mary…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>So that was Jem, my uncle's brother. He's got the same dark eyes and hair, but drink has not ruined his face – it's younger and more handsome.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Excuse me -&nbsp;I didn't expect to see a girl like you at Jamaica Inn.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>My mother died, so I came here. I'm glad she isn't alive to see how my aunt lives now. I&nbsp;try to help her in the house. What do you do?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>I steal horses.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oh! Aren't you afraid of being caught?</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Not really. Listen, I'm being serious now. Jamaica Inn is no place for you with its ugly business. I can help you go to Bodmin.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I don't need help. I can&nbsp;<strong>look after</strong>&nbsp;myself.</p> 
 <p><strong>Jem<br /></strong>Well... I'm going now. But remember – I live in Trewartha if you ever need me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>How can I trust him? He's a thief -&nbsp;and he's Joss's brother. The loneliness of my situation grips me again.</p> 
 <p>The men have returned. From my window, I can see them lifting heavy objects onto the wagons. These men are&nbsp;<strong>desperate</strong>&nbsp;and dangerous. And Jem…? Did he come to warn his brother that they were coming?</p> 
 <p>This morning, I'm doing the washing. My uncle is away, so I can almost feel the happiness I used to feel when I worked on the farm.</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>Mary!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>What is it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>Mr Bassat is here - &nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>magistrate,&nbsp;</strong>with another man. What are we going to do? He's never been before: he must know something.</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>What am I going to say?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>This is my chance to tell an officer about Joss - but look at my aunt. She is trembling and terrified.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Just say Joss is away.</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>Mary, you won't tell Mr Bassat about the wagons, will you? If anything happens to Joss, I'll kill myself.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Bassat<br /></strong>You took your time. Where's the landlord?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>He's not here. &nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Bassat<br /></strong>When will he be back?</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>He went out after breakfast. I don't know when he's&nbsp;<strong>getting back.</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Bassat<br /></strong><strong>Damn!&nbsp;</strong>Listen to me – your husband is giving this whole area - my land - a bad&nbsp;<strong>reputation</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>I don't know what you mean. We live a quiet life here&nbsp;- my niece will tell you!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Bassat<br /></strong>I'm not a fool. We'll look around now we are here.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>Mr Bassat is having a good look around the inn. He knows there is something hidden here.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Bassat<br /></strong>This place is a&nbsp;<strong>disgrace</strong>! Call yourself an inn! There isn't one clean room.</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>Mary, Mary -&nbsp;the room by the bar!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>We come to the locked room.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I'm afraid this room is locked.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Bassat<br /></strong>Why?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I don't know…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Bassat<br /></strong>Have you ever heard wheels and horses at night?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>No, never.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Bassat<br /></strong>Where is the key to the room?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>My uncle has it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Bassat<br /></strong>Well, we'll have to&nbsp;<strong>break down</strong>&nbsp;the door, then.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>I'm afraid. I hate lying to save my uncle -&nbsp;and part of me will be glad if they find&nbsp;<strong>evidence&nbsp;</strong>of his crimes. I remember the rope. But the fear of what might lie behind the door is clear in my aunt's eyes. For her, it would be the end.</p> 
 <p>In the next episode – I meet a man who I can talk to and tell him about the awful things I have seen – but can he be trusted?</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>I've not seen my uncle much since I arrived. I am glad because he's got a violent temper and treats my aunt badly. This morning, I've been exploring the country around the inn…</p> 
 <p>There is nothing but&nbsp;<strong>heather&nbsp;</strong>and grass for miles. In the distance I can see the&nbsp;<strong>marsh.&nbsp;</strong>It was in this wild and lonely land that my uncle lived as a boy with his two brothers. Last night he told me their story.</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>If you had lived here, you would have taken to drink, like I did… it makes you do things. I had a family once: a father, mother, two brothers, but&nbsp;<strong>each one of them</strong>&nbsp;disappeared one way or another. My father was&nbsp;<strong>hanged</strong>. He killed a man. My brother Jem is clever – but they'll catch him, too and hang him. My brother Matthew – well, he drowned in the marsh. They found him one summer when the marsh dried up…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator</strong><br />When I get back to the inn my uncle is there...</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Well, did you miss me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Did you have a nice trip?</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Nice,&nbsp;<strong>be</strong>&nbsp;<strong>damned</strong>. I've been riding for four days. There was a bit of money involved - that's all I care about.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Well, I'll go and help my aunt...</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>It's me you'll be helping tonight, in the bar...</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>It's Saturday night – the bar is crowded. The air is full of smoke and the smell of unwashed bodies.&nbsp;<strong>All of them</strong>&nbsp;are drunk. Some men are so drunk that they lie on the benches like dead men.</p> 
 <p><strong>Harry (man in bar)<br /></strong>Another pint…</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Hurry up there, girl.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Uncle, I cannot&nbsp;<strong>bear</strong>&nbsp;this. I'm going upstairs.</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Too good for us are you? Well it's almost midnight now. Go to your room and lock your door …</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oww! Let go of my wrist! You're hurting me!</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Hear this: Keep your mouth shut, and you won't get hurt - but if you start to ask...</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oh! What's that noise? It's coming from under my room…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>The moonlight pours into my room creating ghostly shadows. I creep over to the window. My uncle is below and I recognise other men from earlier this evening. There are four or five&nbsp;<strong>wagons.</strong>&nbsp;The men have been taking big boxes from them into the inn.</p> 
 <p><strong>Harry<br /></strong>That's the last of them.</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Good. Get going now. Be quick…</p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>What will you do about him?</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Don't worry. Harry and I will deal with him later…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>I understand now. They are&nbsp;<strong>smuggling!</strong>&nbsp;Jamaica Inn is a perfect place for it. But what's my uncle doing at the moment? I have to go and see…</p> 
 <p>As I get closer to the bar, I hear voices. I hide in the shadows.</p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>No, and no again – I will not be a part of it - that's murder you are talking about Mr Merlyn … killing&nbsp;<strong>innocent</strong>&nbsp;women and children – no!</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Not so fast! By God, you will do as I say. Another man said the same and he was hanging at the end of a rope a few minutes later! Harry – you go and lock the door behind you. I'll finish here…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>I feel sick. My heart has been beating so loudly, I am sure they have heard it. I go back to my room quietly…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>What shall I do? If I had a gun or a knife, I could perhaps hurt my uncle so that the man can escape…But I have nothing …I must do something, though ….</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>I creep downstairs again. The door to the bar is shut. There is silence. I suddenly know I have to open the door to find out.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>There's no one here! Just the tables and a few empty glasses…The door is open at the back. But wait… what's that hanging in the middle of the room? It's swinging… A rope hanging from a hook in the ceiling! But there's nothing on the end of it. What's happened to that man? I fear the worst…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator</strong><br />Next time we meet, an interesting visitor arrives at Jamaica Inn. But who is he and can he be trusted?</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>I have arrived at Jamaica Inn to live with my aunt. My uncle is landlord here. It's a cold and lonely place. I'm at the door and I'm waiting for someone to let me in…</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Who's there?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>It's me. Mary. Mary Yellan.</p> 
 <p>[Heavy door opening]</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Ah, so, you've arrived at last. Well, say hello to your Uncle Joss.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Where is my Aunt Patience?</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>What's the hurry? Don't you want to give me a big kiss first? Patience! She's here. [impatiently] Where are you, woman?</p> 
 <p>Patience! Where in hell is that woman?</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>I'm here. Is it the girl?</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>See for yourself.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>A woman with grey hair hurries towards me. In the candlelight her face is pale. She looks afraid.</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>Mary.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Aunt Patience - I am so glad to see you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>But she is unrecognisable. Her curls have gone and her happy smile also. I can see that&nbsp;<strong>she's been crying</strong>. This woman is old and anxious. She starts to cry.</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Stop&nbsp;<strong>whimpering</strong>, woman. Can't you see the girl is hungry! I'll take her things up to her room. If there's nothing to eat on the table when I come down, you'll soon have something to cry about.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>He lifts my heavy box as if it's a bag of feathers. He is huge with shoulders like those of a bear.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>The kitchen is full of smoke from the fire. There are&nbsp;<strong>stains</strong>&nbsp;on the stone floor and there's a strong smell of alcohol. On the table there are two empty bottles of&nbsp;<strong>brandy</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>You mustn't mind your Uncle Joss. Some people find him strange at first, but he is very&nbsp;<strong>respected</strong>&nbsp;here. Just yesterday he told me that a man stopped and told him how much he admired.</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Are you talking rubbish again woman? Sit down Mary. Eat. Listen, Mary. I'm in charge here and you'll do as I say. You'll serve the customers in the bar and help in the house. But if you open your mouth and&nbsp;<strong>squawk</strong>&nbsp;like a hen, you'll be sorry.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I'll help you like you say, but if you hurt my aunt, I'll tell and you'll be&nbsp;<strong>punished</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Patience, go and get me another bottle and be quick. Big words – maybe we're not so different, Mary. Here, drink this.This is my&nbsp;<strong>curse</strong>, Mary – drink.&nbsp;<strong>I've been drinking a little today but</strong>&nbsp;- Oh you'll see how we drink here some Saturdays – they hear the shouting and singing far away. People are afraid of me but I'm afraid of no one. Go to bed now.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>He suddenly grabs my wrist.</p> 
 <p><strong>Joss<br /></strong>Listen carefully. Some nights you'll hear wheels, footsteps and voices outside. You must stay in your room and put your blanket over your ears. If you ask questions, I'll break every bone in your body. Do you understand?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>My room is small and&nbsp;<strong>bare.&nbsp;</strong>Just a bed and a table with a broken mirror. I feel lonely and&nbsp;<strong>trapped&nbsp;</strong>like a bird in a cage. But it's not too late to run away. I&nbsp;<strong>creep</strong>&nbsp;down the dark passage.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>[to herself] Who's crying? It must be my aunt!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>I turn back. My uncle frightens me but I must stay and protect Aunt Patience.</p> 
 <p>I did not sleep well last night. My bed is hard and the blanket is thin. The house is quiet this morning. I'll look for a place to wash downstairs. Here is the bar. Ah, there's a passage here – maybe it's along here. A&nbsp;door – this must be the washroom.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>How strange – it's locked.</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>Mary! What are you doing?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Why is this room locked, Aunt Patience? What's in it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>My aunt looks quickly behind her and her eyes are like a frightened rabbit's.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Is it because of the people who come to the inn at night?</p> 
 <p><strong>Patience<br /></strong>Mary. Mary.<strong>&nbsp;I've been worrying about how to tell you this</strong>. I must warn you. Bad things happen here. Men come at night and they go into that room with Joss. When you hear them, you must stay in your room. You must never ask me or your uncle about it again.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrating<br /></strong>What is in this room and why is my Aunt so scared? I'm not going to like it here but I must stay to support her and keep her safe. Next time we meet – I have to work in the bar of Jamaica Inn on Saturday night where I get to meet a group of rough and drunk men. Later that night there are some strange goings-on in the yard outside.&nbsp; What's going on at Jamaica Inn?</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>My name is Mary, Mary Yellan. I'm 23 years old.&nbsp;<strong>I'm not usually very brave, but I feel brave today.</strong>&nbsp;Here I am… on this long journey to Cornwall… on my own.&nbsp;<strong>I've left the farm</strong>&nbsp;where&nbsp;<strong>I've lived all my life</strong>. I wanted to stay there, but last week I made a promise to my dear Mother…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mother<br /></strong>[coughing/weak voice] Mary, my child… listen… I won't be in this world much longer.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Don't say that, Mother.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mother<br /></strong>It's true, Mary. But, before I go,&nbsp;<strong>I have only one wish</strong>…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Yes, Mother dear?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mother<br /></strong>When I die, promise me you will go and live with my sister, Patience.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>But why can't I stay here on the farm, here in Helford?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mother<br /></strong>You can't stay here alone.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>But&nbsp;<strong>I haven't seen Patience since I was a child</strong>!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mother<br /></strong>I know, but soon she will be the only family you have. [coughing]&nbsp;<strong>I have written to her. She has agreed</strong>&nbsp;that you can go and live with her and your uncle Joshua.&nbsp;<strong>They live on Bodmin Moor in Cornwall</strong>. Here, take her letter.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Bodmin Moor! But that's so far away!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>Mother died last Tuesday. The funeral was yesterday. We buried her next to Papa.&nbsp;<strong>Now, I'm on my way to my aunt's house.&nbsp; I've got the letter here</strong>…</p> 
 <p>[reading]<strong>&nbsp;Joss and I now live in Jamaica Inn</strong>, where he is&nbsp;<strong>landlord</strong>. It's on the road between Bodmin and Launceston…</p> 
 <p>This journey is so long! We have been travelling for hours. What a wild and lonely county Cornwall is. My only&nbsp;<strong>consolation&nbsp;</strong>is that I will see my aunt again after so many years. Oh how pretty she was with her golden hair and blue eyes! Always laughing, enjoying ourselves…</p> 
 <p>But&nbsp;<strong>I never visited her&nbsp;</strong>and I never met her husband either. … Ah, at last, I can see houses and people – this must be Bodmin town.</p> 
 <p>There is just me and one other traveller left. It's so cold and grey outside…&nbsp;<strong>The rain is lashing against the window</strong>. I wish it would stop! All I can see is mile upon mile of empty&nbsp;<strong>moorland</strong>. No trees… no houses… I wonder how many more hours we have to travel?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Excuse me, sir – is it much further?</p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong><strong>Where are you going?</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Jamaica Inn…&nbsp;<strong>Do you know it?</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>Maybe I do and maybe I don't… and&nbsp;<strong>why are you going there?</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I'm going to live there… with my aunt and uncle.</p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>That will be Joss Merlyn...&nbsp;<strong>People say that queer things go on at Jamaica Inn</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong><strong>What do you mean – queer?</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>It's just what they say. But&nbsp;<strong>respectable people don't go there any more</strong>. It's a lonely place.</p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>If I were you, Miss,&nbsp; I would go on to Launceston tonight and go back to Bodmin tomorrow.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>But I can't.<strong>&nbsp;My aunt and uncle are waiting for me.</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>Jamaica Inn is no place for a young woman.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I have nowhere else to go…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>What can he mean by 'queer things'?&nbsp;<strong>Why is he looking at me in that curious way?</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Driver<br /></strong>Whoa boy…! Slow now.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong><strong>Why have we stopped here</strong>&nbsp;– it's the middle of nowhere?</p> 
 <p><strong>Driver<br /></strong>Jamaica Inn! There you go Miss.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>But there's nothing here! Oh – what's that? There up on the&nbsp;<strong>moor</strong>&nbsp;- a dark building with tall chimneys. I can see a path to the door. There's a sign twisting in the wind. It says 'Jamaica Inn'.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mary narrator<br /></strong>Suddenly&nbsp;<strong>I feel frightened. I want to climb back in the coach.</strong></p> 
 <p>Too late –&nbsp;<strong>it's already gone</strong>... I suppose my only choice now is to enter Jamaica Inn.</p> 
 <p>Next time we meet – I get to meet my Aunt Patience and Uncle Joss. I discover what a mean and scary man my uncle is. And I discover a locked room – what is inside? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello. Alice has had lots of adventures in Wonderland. Now, she has been called as a witness in the trial of the Knave of Hearts. The King of Hearts is the judge, but Alice has grown so tall that her head reaches the top of the courthouse and all the people seem very far away.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>How small you all are!</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>The witness must come to the witness box!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice jumped up and knocked over the jury box. It was full of animals and they all fell out.</p> 
 <p><strong>Animals<br /></strong>Ooh, ow, oh are you hurt? Excuse me, is that my chair? Etc...</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>I'm so sorry!</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>What do you know about this business?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Nothing at all!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The King looked in his Book of&nbsp;<strong>Rules</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Rule forty-two. &quot;All&nbsp;<strong>persons</strong>&nbsp;more than a mile high must leave the court.&quot;</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>I'm not a mile high!</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Indeed you are not! You are nearly two miles high!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Well, I'm not going! And&nbsp;<strong>you can't make</strong>&nbsp;me!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice had grown a little bit more, and the King, who was now the size of Alice's shoe,&nbsp;<strong>could see</strong>&nbsp;she was right about that part. His face went very&nbsp;<strong>pale</strong>&nbsp;and he closed&nbsp;his Book of Rules.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>White Rabbit. Ask the jury: what is their decision about this matter? Did the Knave steal the Queen's tarts?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>But there was more&nbsp;<strong>evidence.</strong>&nbsp;The White Rabbit gave a letter to the King, who opened it and turned to the Knave of Hearts.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Knave of Hearts, did you write this?</p> 
 <p><strong>Knave of Hearts<br /></strong>I didn't write it! Look at the end of it: there is no name written there!</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Then you are not a honest man! An honest man always signs his work! Read the letter!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And the White Rabbit read the letter. No-one understood a single word of it.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>That's the most important evidence we've heard today!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>I don't believe there's any meaning in it!</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>If there's no meaning in it, then we don't need to try to find any! Jury, what is your decision?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The Queen stamped her feet.</p> 
 <p><strong>Queen<br /></strong>No, no no!&nbsp;<strong>Punishment</strong>&nbsp;first, decision afterwards!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>That's nonsense! The punishment comes last!</p> 
 <p><strong>Queen<br /></strong>Be quiet!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>I won't!</p> 
 <p><strong>Queen<br /></strong>Off with her head!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>No-one moved. Alice realised she had grown to her full size.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Who cares about you? All of you!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice looked down at the little people all around her. She suddenly realised…</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>You're nothing but a pack of cards!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>As soon as she said this, the animals, the birds, the King and Queen and everyone else turned into a pack of cards and they all flew up into the air and came flying down upon her. The cards fluttered and flew all around her head and shoulders and Alice gave a scream as she tried to beat them off with her hands…</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Ohhhh!!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And then another strange thing happened to Alice. She found herself back on the riverbank where our story began. She opened her eyes and saw her sister smiling at her.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice's sister<br /></strong>Wake up, Alice dear! What a long sleep you've had!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice's sister gently brushed away some dead leaves that had fallen from the tree and onto her face.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Oh… I've had such a curious dream.&nbsp;There was a White Rabbit and … I got bigger and smaller … and I met a caterpillar and a Hatter … and played croquet and … a cat that smiled and … so many things.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice told her sister all about the Wonderland in her dream and the adventures she had had there. Perhaps one day Alice will dream herself back to Wonderland. If she does, I'll be sure to tell you. Goodbye.</p>

 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The rest of the room was filled with birds and animals and the whole pack of playing-card people. Alice saw the White Rabbit. He was holding a&nbsp;<strong>trumpet&nbsp;</strong>in one hand and a large piece of paper in the other. The White Rabbit blew the trumpet.</p> 
 <p><strong>White Rabbit<br /></strong>Silence in court!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The trial started. The King was the judge and twelve animals were the jury. The King spoke first.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Read the accusation!</p> 
 <p><strong>White Rabbit<br /></strong>The Queen of Hearts, she made some&nbsp;<strong>tarts</strong>,<br />All on a summer day.<br />The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts<br />And took them quite away.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Knave of Hearts, what do you say?</p> 
 <p><strong>Knave of Hearts<br /></strong>It wasn't me! I didn't do it!</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Silence! Call the first&nbsp;<strong>witness</strong>!</p> 
 <p><strong>White Rabbit<br /></strong>Bring in the first witness!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The first witness was the Hatter. He looked very&nbsp;<strong>nervous</strong>. He came into the court with a cup of tea in one shaking hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Give your evidence Hatter, and don't be nervous, or you'll lose your head!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The King's words made the Hatter even more frightened. He was so confused and that he took a large bite out of his teacup instead of his bread and butter.</p> 
 <p><strong>Hatter<br /></strong>I'm a poor man, your Majesty.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>You're a very poor speaker.</p> 
 <p><strong>White Rabbit<br /></strong>Poor Hatter. He&nbsp;<strong>didn't use to be</strong>&nbsp;mad, you know. He&nbsp;<strong>used to be</strong>&nbsp;quite normal.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>And&nbsp;<strong>I used to be taller</strong>…</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Just then, Alice began to have a curious feeling.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Ohh.. I'm growing again!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>No-one noticed that Alice was getting taller. Everyone was watching the Hatter, who was too frightened to speak.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>You may go. Call the next witness!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The next witness was the cook.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Cook, what are tarts made of?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cook<br /></strong>Pepper, mostly.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Everybody started sneezing. Nobody seemed to notice Alice growing taller and taller. By the time they stopped sneezing, the cook had disappeared.</p> 
 <p><strong>King<br /></strong>Never mind! Call the next witness!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice watched as the White Rabbit studied the piece of paper, looking for the name of the next witness. Imagine her surprise when he straightened up, took a deep breath and shouted the name of the next witness…</p> 
 <p><strong>White Rabbit<br /></strong>Alice!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Everybody in the courtroom turned to look at Alice. Alice felt herself grow a little taller, as she took a deep breath, and stepped forward. Next time, I'll tell you what happened when Alice gives her evidence and the White Rabbit reads a letter from the Knave of Hearts. Curiouser and curiouser… Goodbye.</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello! After all her adventures, Alice has finally found the beautiful garden she's been looking for all this time. It's full of beautiful white roses. Alice wandered through the flowers until she saw a gardener. He was doing something very strange...</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Why are you painting the roses red?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gardener<br /></strong>The Queen - she wants red roses and I put white roses in by mistake. If the Queen finds them, she'll cut my head off! Oh no! Here comes the Queen!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The gardener threw himself to the ground and lay with his face down. A line of&nbsp;<strong>soldiers</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>courtiers</strong>&nbsp;came marching into the rose garden. They didn't look like people at all. They looked exactly like playing cards: their bodies were square and flat with their heads at the top and their hands and feet in the four corners. First came a group of ten soldiers, who were decorated with black clubs, then came ten of the Queen's servants, who were covered in red diamonds. Then came all the princes and princesses, wearing red hearts. The&nbsp;<strong>Knave of Hearts</strong>&nbsp;was carrying a crown on a cushion, and last of all came the King and Queen of Hearts. When they got to Alice, everybody stopped. The Queen looked at Alice.</p> 
 <p><strong>Queen<br /></strong>Who is this?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>I'm Alice,&nbsp;<strong>Your Majesty.</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Queen<br /></strong>Can you play croquet?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Yes!</p> 
 <p><strong>Queen<br /></strong>Come on then! Everyone get to your places!</p> 
 <p><strong>Animals<br /></strong>I'm over here... Are you over there? This is place, no this is your place, are we ready?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Everyone began running in different directions until they got into place and the game began. It was a very curious game: everything seemed to be alive! The balls were&nbsp;<strong>hedgehogs</strong>&nbsp;and the croquet mallets were&nbsp;<strong>flamingos</strong>. All the playing-card-soldiers bent over so they looked like&nbsp;<strong>arches</strong>. The players had to catch the flamingos first, which wasn't easy because they kept flying away. When the flamingos were caught, each player held their flamingo tightly under one arm, with the long neck and head hanging down to the ground. Then the hedgehogs curled up into spiky balls – and the players used the flamingos' heads to hit the hedgehogs so that they rolled through the playing-card soldier arches.</p> 
 <p><strong>Animals<br /></strong>Is it my turn? Oh good shot! Have another go... oh do stand still! Very nicely played, it's your turn again, very good, etc...</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>What a curious game! I suppose I should play.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>It was a very curious game! There didn't seem to be any rules. Everyone played at the same time and the hedgehogs kept running away. Alice took a flamingo and tried to hit a hedgehog with it. But the flamingo moved its head and she missed. Soon the players began arguing and fighting for the hedgehogs and the Queen went around stamping her feet and shouting at everyone.</p> 
 <p><strong>Queen<br /></strong>Off with your head! Off with her head!</p> 
 <p><strong>Animals</strong><br />No it isn't your turn! That's my ball, give me my hedgehog! It's my turn, not yours! Is that my flamingo? That's cheating!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>How&nbsp;<strong>will I get out</strong>&nbsp;of here?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>As Alice was looking around for a way to escape, suddenly the Cheshire-Cat appeared in the air. He wasn't sitting on anything, he was just floating.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cheshire-Cat<br /></strong>Are you enjoying the croquet?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>No. I don't think they play fairly at all. Everyone is arguing and there aren't any rules.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cheshire-Cat<br /></strong>How do you like the Queen?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Not at all! I suppose I should try to play or&nbsp;<strong>she might cut off my head</strong>!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice went to find her hedgehog. She found it having a fight with another one. While she was trying to pull the two animals apart, her flamingo flew away.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Oh dear! I'm not doing very well at this game.&nbsp;<strong>What will the Queen think</strong>?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice was right to worry. Most of the other players had made the Queen angry for one reason or another and the soldiers took them away one by one. Soon there were only the King, the Queen and Alice left in the game. The Queen turned to Alice.</p> 
 <p><strong>Queen<br /></strong>You! Come here! Who were you talking to?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>If you please, your Majesty...</p> 
 <p><strong>Voice<br /></strong>The&nbsp;<strong>trial&nbsp;</strong>is starting! The&nbsp;<strong>trial&nbsp;</strong>is starting!</p> 
 <p><strong>Queen<br /></strong>The trial! Oh good! I love trials! Come along!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice had no choice but to follow the Queen. We'll leave her there for now. Next time. I'll tell you all about the Knave of Hearts, the stolen jam tarts and what happened when Alice met the Hatter and The White Rabbit again. Goodbye.</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Hello! Alice is trying to find her way back to the beautiful garden she saw when she first arrived in Wonderland. On her way, she met the Cheshire-Cat in the woods, who told Alice about the March Hare and the Hatter. Alice found the March Hare and the Hatter, having a tea-party.</p> 
 <p><strong>Hatter and March Hare</strong><br />Would you like some tea? Tea? Yes please, and cake? One cake... two cakes? One lump or two?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice</strong><br />Curiouser and curiouser. They're having a tea-party. But where are all the guests?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />The Hatter and the March Hare were sitting at one end of a very long table, which had empty cups and plates all the way along it. But the only other guest was a mouse, who was sound asleep. Alice decided to join them.</p> 
 <p><strong>Hatter and March Hare</strong><br />No room here! I'm sorry, no room!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice</strong><br />There's plenty of room!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Alice sat down. The Hatter opened his eyes very wide.</p> 
 <p><strong>Hatter</strong><br />Why is a raven like a writing desk?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice</strong><br />Ooh, good. Riddles! I love riddles!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />The March Hare looked at Alice.</p> 
 <p><strong>March Hare</strong><br />You mean you know the answer, don't you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice</strong><br />Yes, I do.</p> 
 <p><strong>March Hare</strong><br />Then you should say what you mean!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice</strong><br />I do. At least, I mean what I say. That's the same thing, isn't it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Hatter</strong><br />But why is a raven like a writing-desk? Have you guessed the answer yet?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice</strong><br />No. I give up. What's the answer?</p> 
 <p><strong>Hatter</strong><br />I don't know! Do you know?</p> 
 <p><strong>March Hare</strong><br />I don't know either!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice</strong><br />I think you should only ask riddles if you know the answer.</p> 
 <p><strong>March Hare</strong><br />Have some more tea.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice</strong><br />I haven't had any tea, have I? So I can't take more.</p> 
 <p><strong>Hatter</strong><br />You mean you can't take less. It's very easy to take more than nothing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Alice got up and walked off without saying goodbye.</p> 
 <p><strong>March Hare</strong><br />More tea, Hatter?</p> 
 <p><strong>Hatter</strong><br />Don't mind if I do!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />The Hatter and the March Hare didn't seem to notice her leaving. Alice went back into the woods. She looked back as she walked away. The Hatter and the March Hare were trying to put the mouse into the teapot.</p> 
 <p><strong>Hatter and Hare</strong><br />Mousey mousey! In you go! Plop! Oh, he does wriggle so. More tea?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice</strong><br />I'll never go there again! That was the stupidest tea-party I've ever been to in all my life!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Back in the woods, Alice saw a tree with a door in it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice</strong><br />That's very curious! I wonder what could be behind a door in a tree...</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />In Wonderland anything can be behind any door. Alice opened the door and there she was at the beginning of her adventures again – in the hall with the locked doors and the table with the little key on it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice</strong><br />I remember that little door and the key! This time I know what to do! I'm finally going to get into the garden!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Alice had learned a lot about growing and shrinking in Wonderland. She took the key off the table first… and then ate some of the mushroom she had taken from the caterpillar and put in her pocket. Soon she was small enough to unlock the door and go through it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice</strong><br />Oh, it's so pretty here!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />We'll leave Alice here for now, happy in the garden at last. Soon, she's going to meet the Queen and play croquet. Will she still be happy then? I'll tell you next time.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello. Alice is in the woods. She's trying to find her way back to the beautiful garden that she saw when she first arrived in Wonderland. Here she is, outside a little house. She's wondering who lives there.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>I wonder who could live in such a little house!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Before she had the chance to wonder for very long,&nbsp;<strong>a fish ran&nbsp;</strong>out of the woods and knocked on the door. The fish was wearing a footman's uniform.&nbsp;<strong>Another footman opened&nbsp;</strong>the door. Alice was near enough to hear what the fish said.</p> 
 <p><strong>Footman<br /></strong>From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play&nbsp;<strong>croquet</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>The Duchess!!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice was so curious<strong>&nbsp;she went</strong>&nbsp;to knock on the door. But there was no use knocking, because it was so noisy inside the house that no-one could possibly hear her little knock. Alice was even more curious now so&nbsp;<strong>she opened</strong>&nbsp;the door…</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Hello?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And&nbsp;<strong>she found</strong>&nbsp;herself in a noisy, smoky kitchen. A cook was cooking a pan of soup over the fire and the Duchess was holding a crying baby. There was also a big cat who was sitting above the fire and smiling from ear to ear. Everyone was sneezing except the cook and the cat.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>There's too much pepper in that soup! Please would you tell me why&nbsp;<strong>your cat grins</strong>&nbsp;like that?</p> 
 <p><strong>The Duchess<br /></strong>It's a Cheshire-Cat, and that's why.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong><strong>I didn't know</strong>&nbsp;Cheshire-Cats grinned. In fact<strong>, I didn't know</strong>&nbsp;cats could grin.</p> 
 <p><strong>The Duchess<br /></strong>You don't know much, and that's a fact.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Just then,&nbsp;<strong>the cook took</strong>&nbsp;the pan of soup off the fire, and&nbsp;<strong>started</strong>&nbsp;throwing&nbsp;<strong>pots and pans</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>plates and dishes</strong>&nbsp;all around the kitchen.&nbsp;<strong>Some of them hit</strong>&nbsp;the Duchess, but&nbsp;<strong>she didn't seem</strong>&nbsp;to notice.&nbsp;<strong>Some of them hit</strong>&nbsp;the baby, who was crying anyway.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Oh please! The baby! Be careful!</p> 
 <p><strong>The Duchess<br /></strong>Here! You hold it if you like!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And&nbsp;<strong>the Duchess threw</strong>&nbsp;the baby at Alice who just managed to catch it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Ohhh!!</p> 
 <p><strong>The Duchess<br /></strong>I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And, with that, The Duchess left.&nbsp;<strong>Alice held</strong>&nbsp;the baby and wondered what to do with it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>What am I going to do with you? You're a strange shape… Oh! You're a not a baby. You're a… you're a pig!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>It was easy to decide what to do with a pig. Alice took it outside and let it go into the woods.&nbsp;<strong>The Cheshire-Cat sat</strong>&nbsp;in a tree and watched her.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Cheshire-Cat, could you tell me which way I should go?</p> 
 <p><strong>Cheshire-Cat<br /></strong>A Hatter lives over here, and a March Hare lives over there. They're both&nbsp;<strong>mad</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>But I don't want to meet mad people.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cheshire-Cat<br /></strong>Oh, we're all mad here. Are you playing croquet with the Queen today?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>I'd love to play croquet with the Queen… but&nbsp;<strong>she hasn't invited me</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Cheshire-Cat<br /></strong>You'll see me there…</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The cat disappeared. Alice set off in the direction of the March Hare's house and soon she came to a house. Outside the house she saw a tea-party quite unlike any tea-party she had ever seen before. Next time, I'll tell you all about the Tea Party and what happened when&nbsp;<strong>Alice met</strong>&nbsp;the March Hare and the Hatter. Goodbye.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>After Alice frightened everyone by growing as big as a house, she ate some little cakes and&nbsp;<strong>shrank</strong>&nbsp;again. She&nbsp;<strong>doesn't like</strong>&nbsp;being so tiny, so she's looking for something to make her grow to the right size. But this is Wonderland and what she finds, sitting on top of a mushroom, is very curious indeed…</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Am I as small as a mushroom, or is the mushroom as tall as me? Ohh!!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Sitting on top of the mushroom was a blue caterpillar smoking a&nbsp;<strong>hookah pipe.</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Caterpillar<br /></strong>Who are you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>I… I'm not sure.&nbsp;<strong>I know</strong>&nbsp;who I was when I woke up this morning. But I've changed so many times since then!</p> 
 <p><strong>Caterpillar<br /></strong>What do you mean by that? Explain yourself!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>I can't explain myself because I'm not myself. It's very confusing…<strong>&nbsp;I think</strong>&nbsp;you should tell me who YOU are first.</p> 
 <p><strong>Caterpillar<br /></strong>Why?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Ummm…</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice couldn't think of any good reason. She decided to leave.</p> 
 <p><strong>Caterpillar<br /></strong>Come back! I have something important to say!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Yes?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Caterpillar<br /></strong>Don't be unhappy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Is that all?</p> 
 <p><strong>Caterpillar<br /></strong>No. So you think you've changed, do you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>I have, sir. I don't stay the same size for more than ten minutes!</p> 
 <p><strong>Caterpillar<br /></strong>What size do you want to be?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Oh,&nbsp;<strong>I don't mind</strong>. A little bit bigger is all I would like. Seven centimetres is such a terrible&nbsp;<strong>height</strong>!</p> 
 <p><strong>Caterpillar<br /></strong>It is a very good height! I myself am exactly seven centimetres in height!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And with that, the caterpillar crawled off the mushroom and away.</p> 
 <p><strong>Caterpillar<br /></strong>One side of the mushroom will make you grow taller. The other side will make you grow shorter. Seven centimetres indeed!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Hmmm… let me pull this side… and now this side…But which side is which?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>There was only one way to find out the answer to that question. Alice took a bite of one piece of the mushroom - and shrank so quickly that she hit her&nbsp;<strong>chin</strong>&nbsp;on her foot.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice</strong><br />Ouch!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Quickly, she ate some of the other piece of mushroom and …</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Where have my&nbsp;<strong>shoulders</strong>&nbsp;gone? And my hands – where are you, hands?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice grew and grew until her&nbsp;<strong>neck</strong>&nbsp;was as long as a snake. Up and up she grew, through the branches and leaves, until her head was higher than the trees. Alice found she could move her neck just like a snake, bending this way and that. She was about to use her long neck to push her head down into the trees&nbsp;and look for her shoulders and hands, when suddenly a furious bird flew at her.</p> 
 <p><strong>Bird<br /></strong>Snake! Snake!&nbsp;<strong>You want</strong>&nbsp;my eggs!&nbsp;<strong>I know</strong>!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>I'm not a snake! I'm a… I'm a little girl!</p> 
 <p><strong>Bird<br /></strong>Little girl or snake, it doesn't matter to me, you want my eggs just the same!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>I don't want your eggs, really I don't!</p> 
 <p><strong>Bird<br /></strong>Then be off with you! Go away!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The bird settled angrily into its nest. Alice ate a little of one side of the mushroom, then a little of the other, then a little of the first again until she was a good size. She decided to find her way back the door to the beautiful garden that she saw when she first arrived in Wonderland. As she walked through the forest she found a little clearing, with a small house in it, not much more than a metre or so high.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>I wonder who lives here? The house is so small – anyone who lives here will surely be afraid of me!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice ate a little more of the mushroom and quickly brought herself down to the right size for this little house. Next time, Alice meets a walking fish, talks to a smiling cat and has to look after a baby. Goodbye.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello. Alice fell down a Rabbit Hole one day and found herself in a Wonderland, where Animals talk, curious things happen and everything she eats and drinks makes her grow bigger or smaller. Now she is sitting alone. Suddenly, she heard footsteps. The White Rabbit was running towards her. He seemed to be very worried.</p> 
 <p><strong>White Rabbit<br /></strong>Oh dear! Where can I have dropped them? I must find them, or I'm sure The Duchess will&nbsp;<strong>chop</strong>&nbsp;<strong>off</strong>&nbsp;my head!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice guessed he was looking for the gloves and fan that he had dropped - but she didn't know where they were either. After all her growing and shrinking, Alice was exactly the same size as the rabbit. When the White Rabbit saw Alice, he spoke to her quite angrily.</p> 
 <p><strong>White Rabbit<br /></strong>Mary Ann! What are you doing out here? Run home this minute and get me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quickly!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>How surprised he'll be when he finds out I'm not Mary Ann!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice began to run, as the White Rabbit had told her, although she didn't quite know where she should run to. But soon, a little house appeared with the words 'W. Rabbit' written on the door.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>I won't knock on the door. The real Mary Ann might hear me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice crept into the house and went quietly upstairs to a little bedroom… and there she found two fans, three pairs of gloves and…</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Another bottle! I hope it makes me grow bigger again. I'm tired of being such a tiny little thing!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>…and sure enough, Alice began to grow. Taller and taller she grew, until…</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Ouch! My head! That's quite tall enough. That's tall enough! O-o-o-oh…</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice tried her hardest to stop growing - but it seemed to her like the harder she tried, the taller she grew. Soon Alice was so big that she filled the whole room. Her head pressed against the ceiling, her arm went out of the window and one of her feet went up the&nbsp;<strong>chimney</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>What will become of me now?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Outside the house, a crowd started to gather. Alice heard voices.</p> 
 <p><strong>Voices<br /></strong>Oh my goodness, oh my -&nbsp;whatever could it be? What is it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Soon, the White Rabbit arrived.</p> 
 <p><strong>White</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Rabbit<br /></strong>What's that in the window?</p> 
 <p><strong>Voice<br /></strong>It's an arm, sir!</p> 
 <p><strong>White Rabbit<br /></strong>An arm? Well, it's got no business being there! Bill! Bill! Fetch the&nbsp;<strong>ladder</strong>&nbsp;and take it away!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Bill was the&nbsp;<strong>gardener</strong>. He brought a ladder and climbed up on to the roof.</p> 
 <p><strong>White Rabbit<br /></strong>I won't have an arm in my bedroom! Down you go Bill, down the chimney!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Poor Bill went up the ladder and tried to go down the chimney. But Alice's foot was waiting for him… with a big kick.</p> 
 <p><strong>Bill<br /></strong>Ohhhhhhhh!!!!</p> 
 <p><strong>Voices<br /></strong>Oohs and ahhs, gasps etc Is he hurt? Help him up, give him some air…</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>There! That's got rid of him! Now what will they try?</p> 
 <p><strong>Voices<br /></strong>Try the cakes!</p> 
 <p><strong>White Rabbit<br /></strong>Yes! The cakes: bring the cakes! We'll need a lot of them. That's right. Now, everybody, throw them through the other window!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>What's this…? Oh! Lots and lots of little cakes. &nbsp;I wonder…&nbsp;<strong>If I ate them, would I shrink again</strong>? They must do something… and I must get out of this house. I'll try just one of them to start with.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice ate one of the little cakes, and soon found herself to be a little smaller. She ate another and another, until at last she was just the right size to run out of the bedroom… and out of the house.</p> 
 <p><strong>Voices<br /></strong>There she is! What is it? Get her! Catch her, quickly!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>But Alice was too fast for them. She ran far away from the White Rabbit's house, deeper and deeper into the forest until she became quite lost. She was wondering what she could eat or drink to make her grow to the right size again, when suddenly she saw in front of her a large mushroom - about the same size as herself, with a large blue&nbsp;<strong>caterpillar</strong>&nbsp;sitting on top of it, smoking a pipe and taking no notice of Alice at all. Will the caterpillar help Alice to grow again? I'll tell you next time.</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello. So far, Alice had been very small, then very tall, then very small again in this strange Wonderland she found when she chased a talking rabbit and fell down the rabbit hole. Now she was swimming in a pool of her own tears, wondering what was going to happen next.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Ooh, whatever's this? It's a mouse! Hello mouse! You're a very big mouse… but then, I'm a very, very little girl today. Whatever next?&nbsp;<strong>If this mouse talks, I won't be at all surprised</strong>… Oh Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I'm very tired of swimming about here, Mouse! Mouse? Hmmm. Perhaps it doesn't understand English. Maybe it's a French mouse! Now, what was that French I learned in school? O&ugrave; est ma chatte?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mouse<br /></strong>Chatte? Cat! Did you say cat?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Oh, I'm so sorry Mouse! I forgot mice don't like cats.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mouse<br /></strong>Would you like cats if you were me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Well… perhaps not. But my cat Dinah is different. She's such a sweet, quiet thing.&nbsp;<strong>If you meet her, I'm sure you'll like her.</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Mouse<br /></strong>We won't talk about cats any more, thank you!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>We won't! Er… do you - do you er… like dogs? They can be so sweet and they kill all the rats… and… Oh dear!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Oh please come back, dear Mouse.&nbsp;<strong>We won't talk about cats or dogs, if you don't like them</strong>. Swim with me to the shore.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>So Alice and the mouse swam to the edge of the pool of tears. And as they swam, they were joined by lots of other&nbsp;<strong>creatures</strong>&nbsp;that had fallen into the pool, just like Alice and the mouse. There was a duck and a&nbsp;<strong>dodo&nbsp;</strong>and many other strange animals that Alice had never seen before. All the creatures had the same question.</p> 
 <p><strong>Animals<br /></strong>How can we get dry? What can we do? I'm so far away from my nest, that pool was very wet and salty, oh it's no good for my fur, etc…</p> 
 <p><strong>Dodo<br /></strong>We must have a Caucus-race!</p> 
 <p><strong>Animals<br /></strong>Hooray! Hoorah!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>What's a Caucus-race, Mr Dodo?</p> 
 <p><strong>Dodo<br /></strong>The best way to explain a Caucus-race is to have a Caucus-race!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>It was the strangest race Alice had ever seen. The Dodo marked a circle for the racecourse and everyone stood anywhere they wanted to. Nobody said &quot;One, two, three, go!&quot; but everyone started running. Alice ran too, although she didn't quite know where she should run to. Everyone ran left and right in any direction they pleased. But after half an hour of running, everybody was quite dry again.</p> 
 <p><strong>Dodo<br /></strong>The race is over!</p> 
 <p><strong>Multiple voices<br /></strong>But who has won? Did I win? Who is the winner?</p> 
 <p><strong>Dodo<br /></strong>Ah... yes... Who has won? Who has won? Everybody has won and everyone must have&nbsp;<strong>prizes</strong>! And she must give the prizes!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice didn't have any prizes for a Caucus-race with her, but she searched in her pockets and found some sweets. She had enough sweets to give exactly one sweet to every runner. &nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Here you are, one for you, and one for you…</p> 
 <p><strong>Animals<br /></strong>Thank you very much… oh dear, this has no taste whatsoever… oh, I shall choke…it's rather good, yes very tasty…</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>And one for you – now, does everybody have one? Oh, I must say, my cat Dinah would love a Caucus-race…</p> 
 <p><strong>Animals<br /></strong>Let's go! Come away! Time for bed! Oh, is it that time already? Cats - ugh!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Oh dear. I said it again. Come back! Please! I'm sorry! Poor Dinah. Nobody seems to like her down here and I'm sure she's the best cat in the world!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Poor Alice felt very lonely and sad. She cried quietly to herself for a while. But in a little while, she heard footsteps in the distance. She looked up to see who it was. Next time, I'll tell you who the footsteps belonged to, and how Alice got so big she filled a whole house, and what happened when she kicked poor Bill the lizard up and out of the chimney. Goodbye.</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello! Alice is having some very&nbsp;<strong>curious</strong>&nbsp;adventures at the bottom of a rabbit hole. She drank a drink that made her very small indeed. But she wants to grow bigger so that she can reach the key that will unlock the tiny door to a beautiful garden. After eating some cake she found in a little glass box, Alice started to feel something …</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Curiouser and curiouser! I'm growing! My feet are so far away. Goodbye feet! How will I put my shoes and socks on, I wonder? Ouch!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice grew so big that her head hit the&nbsp;<strong>ceiling</strong>! It was easy to reach the table now. She picked up the tiny key and rushed to the door. But in her excitement, she forgot something again…</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Ohhhh… this is hopeless! I'm much too big for this door now! I'll never get into the garden! I can only look through the door with one eye! Oh…</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice was over nine feet tall, and when a girl that big cries, the&nbsp;<strong>tears</strong>&nbsp;are big too. Alice cried and cried until half the hall was filledwith a salty pool of tears. After a time, Alice heard a little pattering of feet in the distance. She dried her eyes to see what was coming.</p> 
 <p><strong>White Rabbit<br /></strong>Oh! I'm late! I'm so very late! I was told to be early and I'm going to be late. The Duchess will be waiting. Oh my! Oh my! She will be so very angry with me! Oh my!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The sight of The White Rabbit,&nbsp;<strong>splendidly</strong>&nbsp;dressed in his best clothes, and carrying a large&nbsp;<strong>fan</strong>&nbsp;and a pair of white leather gloves was enough to stop Alice's tears.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>If you please, sir…</p> 
 <p><strong>White Rabbit<br /></strong>Oh!! Oh my!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Don't go! I won't hurt – Oh dear! You've dropped your gloves… But look: what a pretty fan. And crying is such hot work. Oh, that's better. Oh dear… how strange everything is today. Yesterday things were normal. But today I'm not sure if I am the same girl who woke up this morning. But, if I'm not the girl who woke up this morning, the question is, &quot;Who am I?&quot;</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice fanned herself while she talked. She felt much cooler. But after a minute or two, something started happening.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Oh: Here's that feeling again.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Then something kept happening. Alice kept fanning herself.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>I don't believe it. I must be… I am! I'm growing smaller again. Smaller than the table. Hello feet! It's good to see you again.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Soon Alice was smaller than ever. She was still&nbsp;<strong>shrinking</strong>&nbsp;and shrinking and she didn't know why.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Oh dear - I'm getting very small. Oh… I'm getting much too small! Oh dear - I shall fade away altogether! Ohh…! The fan? The fan!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Just in time. Alice threw the fan on the floor, so she wouldn't get any smaller. &nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>That was a lucky<strong>&nbsp;escape</strong>! But now I'm small enough to get into the garden!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Poor Alice! There she stood at the little door - but it was locked again. And there was the little key, back in its place, out of reach, on the table.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Oh not again! This is hopeless. I'll never get that key now. I so badly wanted to see the garden. And things are worse than ever - I've never been so small as this in my life. Never!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Things were as bad as ever. And they were about to get worse...</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Ohhh!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And poor little Alice fell into a pool of her own tears. Luckily, she knew how to swim. But she wasn't the only one who had fallen into the pool. Next time, Alice meets a dodo, tries to make friends with a mouse, and joins in a very, very curious race. Goodbye.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello. This is the story of an ordinary girl called Alice. Our story begins on an ordinary summer's day. Let's meet Alice: here she is, sitting next to the river with her sister on a very hot summer's afternoon. Her sister is reading a book, and with no-one to talk to, Alice is bored… and a bit sleepy. Soon, she'll be in a Wonderland full of strange and wonderful adventures… but Alice doesn't know that yet…</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Ohh… There's nothing to do… except lie on the grass and pick&nbsp;<strong>daisies.&nbsp;</strong>Shall I make a daisy chain for my dear little Dinah? Oh… I don't know… it's sooo hot… &nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>White Rabbit<br /></strong>Oh dear! Oh dear! I'm late! I'm so very late! Oh dear oh dear!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>A white rabbit! A talking white rabbit? Perhaps. But a rabbit with a pocket-watch? A rabbit with pockets? I must see where he's going!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice had never seen a rabbit with a pocket, or a waistcoat, or a pocket-watch before. So, she ran after the rabbit as fast as she could, and when the rabbit jumped down a large rabbit hole, Alice jumped straight after him.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Oohhhh… Either this hole is very deep or I'm falling very slowly. And what a curious rabbit-hole! Who would think a rabbit-hole would have bookshelves… and books… and maps… and jars of&nbsp;<strong>marmalade?</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice fell down, down, down. She fell for so long that she began to think about Dinah, her cat.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Dinah will miss me tonight! I hope they'll remember her milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear, I wish you were down here with me!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice was beginning to feel quite sleepy when suddenly, her fall was over and she found herself sitting on a pile of leaves and grass.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Ouch! Who's there?</p> 
 <p><strong>White Rabbit<br /></strong>Oh, my ears and whiskers! How late it's getting!!</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>Wait! Please sir, wait a moment!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The White Rabbit ran down a long tunnel. Alice ran after him. But when she reached the end of the tunnel she found only a long hall with doors all the way round. Alice tried to open the doors – but they were all locked. Then she saw a table with a tiny key on it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>These doors are all too big. There must be a smaller door somewhere. I wonder… hmmm, let me look behind this little curtain… ooh! a tiny little door! Let me try the key… What a beautiful garden! But how can I visit it? The door is so tiny – I can't even fit my head through! Oh! It's no use. I wish I could fold up like a&nbsp;<strong>telescope!</strong> Wait a minute… what's this? It certainly wasn't here before. A bottle –&nbsp;<strong>I wonder what it is?</strong>&nbsp;Let me see the label. Hmmm: Drink me… Oh! Oh! Ohhhhhh!!!! What a curious feeling! I'm folding up like a telescope!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And so she was! Alice got smaller and smaller until she was small enough to fit through the door. But she'd forgotten something …</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>The key!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Alice was too small to reach the key on the table. She tried and tried to climb up the table leg but it was too slippery. When she had tired herself out with trying, poor little Alice sat down and cried.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alice<br /></strong>It's no use. I can't reach the key, so I can't get into the garden and that's that. There's no use crying like that! Alice! I advise you to stop this minute! Oohh… what's this? A little glass box… with cake inside! Ooh: and there's a note. Eat me. Hmmm.&nbsp;<strong>I wonder if it will make me grow...?</strong>&nbsp;If I grow, I will be able to reach the key. But what if makes me even smaller? Well, if it makes me smaller, I will be able to&nbsp;<strong>creep</strong>&nbsp;under the door.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And Alice began to eat the cake. Did she grow big enough to reach the key? Or perhaps the cake made her small enough to creep under the door and into her beautiful garden. I'll tell you what happened next time. Goodbye.&nbsp;</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>A lot has happened to Ebenezer Scrooge. How will this story end? Scrooge's only love used to be money, but now he might be a changed man! After the struggle with the frightening Spirit of Christmas Yet To Come, he found himself in his own bed, in his own room, and he felt happy and ready to change his life.</p> 
 <p><strong>AT SCROOGE'S HOUSE</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>I'm as light as a bird, I'm as happy as an angel, I'm as merry as a schoolboy, I'm as giddy as a drunken man. A merry Christmas to everybody! A happy New Year to all the world. Hello!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Scrooge ran to the window and put out his head. Bells are ringing! Ah! The sun was shining, the air felt fresh. Everything was wonderful!</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Hey boy! Yes, you. Look up. Here in the window! What's today?</p> 
 <p><strong>Boy<br /></strong>It's Christmas Day, sir!</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>It's Christmas Day. I haven't missed it. The Spirits have done it all in one night. Hello, my good boy. Do you know whether they've sold the special turkey that was hanging up there?</p> 
 <p><strong>Boy<br /></strong>What? The one as big as me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Yes! Go and buy it, and tell them to bring it here, so I may give them the address to take it to. Come back with the man, and I'll give you a little money. Come back with him in less than five minutes and I'll give you a lot of money.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The boy ran off as fast as he could.</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>I'll send it to Bob Cratchit's. He will not know who sends it. It's twice the size of Tiny Tim!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Then Scrooge went to the streets. He was greeting everyone: &quot;Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!&quot; He approached the gentlemen who had asked him to help the poor. He had behaved so badly before, when he refused to give anything. But now, he offered them a generous donation.</p> 
 <p><strong>IN THE STREET</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Gentleman<br /></strong>My dear Mr Scrooge, are you serious?! I don't know what to say to such kindness!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>In the afternoon Scrooge went to his nephew's house for that dinner he was invited to but didn't want to go to. Do you remember that? How will his nephew react?</p> 
 <p><strong>AT SCROOGE'S NEPHEW'S HOUSE ENTRANCE</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge's Nephew<br /></strong>Who's that?! Uncle Scrooge! Welcome, uncle! Come and have some fun with us!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>His nephew received him with open arms. And what a party it was! It was great to be in that same party the Spirit of Christmas Present had shown him before. And this time everybody could see Scrooge and talk to him. The next morning, the old man went to the office very early to catch Bob Cratchit coming late. Eighteen and a half minutes late!</p> 
 <p><strong>AT SCROOGE'S OFFICE</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>What do you mean by coming here at this time of day?</p> 
 <p><strong>Bob Cratchit<br /></strong>I'm very sorry, sir. It's only once a year. It will not be repeated. I was making rather merry yesterday, you see, sir...</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Now, I'll tell you what, my friend: I am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer. And therefore… and therefore I'm about to raise your salary!</p> 
 <p><strong>Bob Cratchit<br /></strong>Mr Scrooge?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>A Merry Christmas, Bob, my good friend. I'll raise your salary, and help your hard-working family, and we'll discuss your problems this very afternoon, over a Christmas drink!</p> 
 <p><strong>Bob Cratchit<br /></strong>Wonderful, Mr Scrooge! Wonderful!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Scrooge did it all, and much, much more. He became a second father to Tiny Tim, who did not die, and a good friend to all. Some people laughed to see how he'd changed, but he let them laugh. His own heart laughed: and that was quite enough for him. It was always said of Scrooge, that he knew how to keep the Christmas cheer alive and well. I hope we do the same. Tiny Tim has the last word:</p> 
 <p><strong>Tiny Tim<br /></strong>God bless us, everyone!</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Let's continue the story of Ebenezer Scrooge. The Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come couldn't have been more different from the Spirit of Christmas Present Scrooge had just seen disappearing. It was very tall and it was hidden in a black cape and hood. It didn't speak at all. Scrooge was getting used to the company of ghosts by now but he was afraid of this one.</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Ghost of the Future, I am more afraid of you than any spirit I've seen. But I know your purpose is to do me good. And I hope to become another man from the one I was, so I am prepared to be in your company. And do it with a thankful heart.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Was Scrooge really changing his ways? They went to the financial district and the Spirit stopped near a group of businessmen who were chatting.</p> 
 <p><strong>Businessman 1<br /></strong>I don't know much about it. I only know he's dead. It's likely to be a very cheap funeral! I'm certain I don't know of anybody who'll go to it. Should we volunteer?</p> 
 <p><strong>Businessman 2<br /></strong>I don't mind going if a lunch is provided! What happened to the money?</p> 
 <p><strong>Businessman 1<br /></strong>Well, he didn't give it to me!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Scrooge knew these men. But why did the Spirit make him listen to this conversation? No answer. Then the Spirit took him to a bad part of town. Criminals lived there. Some people were trying to sell stolen goods and they were making fun of the person who used to own them.</p> 
 <p><strong>Housekeeper<br /></strong>Who's the worse for the loss of a few things like these? Not a dead man, I suppose. He frightened everyone away from him when he was alive, but he profits us now he's dead!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And even the shirt the dead man was wearing was sold. A housekeeper, a laundress, an undertaker - they stood in line to make a profit on the dead man's things. Scrooge was shocked! He asked the Ghost to show him people with kindness towards the dead. And where do you think they went? Scrooge found himself back at Bob Cratchit's house. But this time everybody was sad and quiet. Bob Cratchit had just returned from church where he had made arrangements for somebody's funeral.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mrs Cratchit<br /></strong>How was it, Robert?</p> 
 <p><strong>Bob Cratchit<br /></strong>I wish you could have been there, dear wife. It would have done you good to see how green a place it is. But you'll see it often. I promised him that I would walk there on a Sunday. My little, little child...</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Scrooge knew now that Tiny Tim was dead. But who was that man whose death others were talking about? The Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come took Scrooge to a graveyard and pointed ahead. On the stone of a neglected grave, the old man read a name: Ebenezer Scrooge! It was his own name! It was Scrooge's grave!</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>No, Spirit. Oh no, no! Spirit, hear me. I'm not the man I was. Why show me this, if all hope is gone?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Wow! That's a brand new Scrooge we're seeing! And he's not done yet in his pleading...</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Good Spirit, tell me that I still may change these shadows you have shown me, by changing my life. I will celebrate Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I'll live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The Spirits of all Three shall live within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach. Oh, tell me that I may remove the writing on this stone!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Scrooge grabbed the Spirit's hand. The Spirit tried to free itself. In the end, it just disappeared. Scrooge found himself grabbing his own bedpost. What will happen now? I'll tell you next time.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Ebenezer Scrooge woke up just before the clock struck one again. He was ready for the Spirit of Christmas Present. This time, he met his guide in the next room, which looked very different from usual. It was decorated with holly and other plants. On the table, there was a lot of delicious Christmas food like turkey, cake, fruit... Scrooge talked to the ghost.</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Spirit, take me where you like. Last night I learnt a lesson. Tonight, if you want to teach me, let me profit by it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Oh, that's not the Scrooge we knew before. No longer arrogant?! Well, the Spirit took Scrooge to the edge of the city where his clerk Bob Cratchit lived. The man entered his humble home carrying a little boy who had a crutch and iron around his legs. His wife was preparing the meal.</p> 
 <p><strong>AT BOB CRATCHIT'S HOUSE</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Mrs Cratchit<br /></strong>How did Tiny Tim behave at church, Robert?</p> 
 <p><strong>Bob Cratchit<br /></strong>As good as gold! He told me on our way home that he hoped that people noticed him in the church, because he's disabled. It might be good for them to remember on Christmas Day our Lord, who made lame people walk and blind men see.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Tiny Tim was a sweet little boy who knew the meaning of Christmas. But he was very sick. Scrooge felt sorry for him and asked the Spirit what was going to happen.</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Spirit, tell me if Tiny Tim will live.</p> 
 <p><strong>Spirit of Christmas Present<br /></strong>I see an empty seat in the corner, and a crutch without an owner. If things don't change in the future, the child will die.</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>No, no. Oh, no, kind Spirit. Say he'll live!</p> 
 <p><strong>Spirit of Christmas Present<br /></strong>If he's going to die, he should do it, and&nbsp;<em>decrease the surplus population.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>These words caused a huge and sudden feeling of deep regret in Scrooge's heart. That was exactly what he had said earlier to the gentlemen who had asked for a donation to help the poor. If the poor died&nbsp;<em>it would be good to help decrease the surplus population</em>. Then, Scrooge heard Cratchit mention his name...</p> 
 <p><strong>Bob Cratchit<br /></strong>After this wonderful dinner, let's raise our glasses. A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears! God bless us! And also Mr Scrooge, the Father of the Feast! Come on, dear wife!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mrs Cratchit<br /></strong>I wish I had him here, Robert. I'd give him a piece of my mind! Such a horrible, hard, unfeeling man, Mr Scrooge. I'll drink to his health because it is Christmas, but not because of him.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tiny Tim<br /></strong>God bless us every one!</p> 
 <p><strong>Bob Cratchit<br /></strong>Thank you, Tim, my dear child.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>There was no doubt Scrooge was the monster of the family. But if the thought of her husband's selfish boss annoyed Mrs Cratchit, it caused laughter elsewhere. The Ghost of Christmas Present took Scrooge to his nephew's house - to the Christmas dinner the old man had refused to go to.</p> 
 <p><strong>AT SCROOGE'S NEPHEW'S HOUSE</strong>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge's Nephew<br /></strong>...and my uncle said that Christmas was a humbug! He's a funny man, that's the truth. And not as pleasant as he could be. However, his crimes carry their own price. His money is of no use to him. He doesn't do any good with it. He doesn't make himself comfortable with it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The house was full of people dancing, playing games. The Spirit noticed that Scrooge was enjoying himself. The night was coming to an end when Scrooge saw two figures at the ghost's feet. What were they? They looked like children, but they were old and frightening. Scrooge was shocked.</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>I'm sorry to ask but... are they yours?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Spirit of Christmas Present<br /></strong>They are Man's creatures. The boy is Ignorance. The girl is Want. Be afraid of them both, but most of all you should fear this boy for on his face I see a terrible destiny!</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Don't they have a place to go?</p> 
 <p><strong>Spirit of Christmas Present<br /></strong><em>Are there no prisons? Are there no workhouses?</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Yes, once more Scrooge had his own words repeated back to him. He had always thought the poor&nbsp;<em>had prisons and workhouses to go to</em>, hadn't he? Eat your words, Mr Scrooge! Well, the bell struck twelve and that was it for the Ghost of Christmas Present. He disappeared. But the third spirit was coming. You'll hear about it next time.</p> 
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Let's continue the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, the selfish man who didn't like Christmas. Last time, the ghost of his dead partner, Marley, told Scrooge he would be visited by three spirits. They would give him a chance of escaping Marley's fate. Scrooge was in bed when the curtains were opened and he saw a face...</p> 
 <p><strong>Spirit of Christmas Past<br /></strong>I'm the Ghost of Christmas Past - your past. Come with me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The Spirit took Scrooge through a wall and suddenly they found themselves on an open country road. The city had disappeared. Scrooge was very excited.</p> 
 <p><strong>IN SCROOGE'S OLD NEIGHBOURHOOD</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Good heavens! I grew up in this place. That's the river! And... Oh, and I used to climb that tree…</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>He remembered everybody's names. He could see them, but they couldn't see him or the Spirit. Then the Spirit invited Scrooge to go to the local school.</p> 
 <p><strong>Spirit of Christmas Past<br /></strong>The school is not quite empty. There's still a child there...</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>I know! And I know who it is!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>There he was, young Scrooge, alone in a room, sad and lonely. But one Christmas, his young sister came to the school with good news.</p> 
 <p><strong>AT SCROOGE'S OLD SCHOOL</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge's little sister<br /></strong>Hello, my dear brother! I've come to take you home! Home forever and ever. Father is much kinder than he used to be and he sent me in a carriage to bring you. And we'll be together all Christmas, and have the merriest time in all the world!</p> 
 <p><strong>Spirit of Christmas Past<br /></strong>Your sister... She had a big heart! She died when she was an adult and had, I think, children. Your nephew!</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Yes. She was so kind...</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Do I sense regret in Scrooge's voice? He behaved so badly towards his nephew... But time was running out and the Spirit of Christmas Past had another place to take Scrooge to: a big warehouse.</p> 
 <p><strong>AT SCROOGE'S OLD WORKPLACE</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Spirit of Christmas Past<br /></strong>So, do you recognise this place?</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Yes! I was an apprentice here. Oh! Old Mr Fezziwig! That's my old boss!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Fezziwig<br /></strong>Yo ho ho boys, no more work tonight. It's Christmas Eve! Clear away my lads, and let's have lots of room here!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The warehouse was transformed into a bright ballroom in no time at all. In came a musician, Mrs Fezziwig and her three daughters, and all the young men and women employed in the business. It got old Scrooge thinking. He told the Spirit...</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Mr Fezziwig had the power to make us happy or unhappy; to make our work easy or hard; pleasure or pain. The happiness he gave us is as great as if it had cost a huge pile of gold. I should like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk Bob Cratchit just now<strong>.</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Is there a change in old Scrooge? Mmmm... Maybe... Well, the mood was darker when the Spirit took Scrooge to see another Christmas a few years later. Then, the young Scrooge was starting to look obsessed with money. He wasn't alone. There was a young woman by his side. Oh, she was crying...</p> 
 <p><strong>IN THE PAST</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge's girlfriend<br /></strong>Something else has taken my place; if it can cheer and comfort you as I wanted to do, I have no reason to cry. May you be happy in the life you have chosen!</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Spirit, show me no more. Take me home. Why do you torture me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>It was hard for Scrooge to see how his girlfriend left him when he started to fall in love with money. But the Spirit's work wasn't done yet. He took Scrooge to yet another Christmas a few years from then. And the greedy, old man saw her happy with a husband and children - children who he almost wished were his own. Scrooge was very depressed when he got back home: the kind sister whose son he rejected, the generous employer, the lost girlfriend – that's a lot to take in! But there were still two spirits left. What would the Spirit of Christmas Present show Scrooge? Let's see it tomorrow. I can't wait!</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>This is the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, a man who loved money and didn't like Christmas. There he was, on Christmas Eve, in his office. He was keeping an eye on his clerk Bob Cratchit. Scrooge wanted to get every little bit of work from Cratchit before allowing him to spend Christmas Day at home. Scrooge thought Christmas was a waste of time! Even his nephew couldn't convince him that it wasn't.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>IN SCROOGE'S OFFICE</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge's Nephew<br /></strong>A Merry Christmas, uncle!</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Bah! Humbug!</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge's Nephew<br /></strong>You don't mean that, I'm sure!</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>What's Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money? You find yourself a year older, but not an hour richer! What good has it ever done you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge's Nephew<br /></strong>I've always thought of Christmas as a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time. A time when men and women seem to open their hearts freely. It's never put money in my pocket, but I believe that it's done me good!</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Humbug!</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge's Nephew<br /></strong>Come on, uncle, come and have dinner with us tomorrow.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Scrooge's nephew was persistent but the old man wouldn't change his mind. He was in his usual bad mood when two gentlemen came to his office to ask for a donation to offer Christmas dinner to the poor. Scrooge worked in the money-lending business. No donation from him...</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Gentlemen, are there no prisons and workhouses, where the poor receive food and accommodation in return for some work?</p> 
 <p><strong>Gentleman<br /></strong>We wish we could say there aren't any, Mr Scrooge. Many poor people would rather die than go to prison or the...</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>They should die and decrease the surplus population. And... well, it's none of my business anyway. They cost a lot of money, and the poor should go there. Goodbye, sir.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Typical Scrooge! He feels sorry for no-one, helps no-one. With him, it's all about money. He thought of nothing else. His partner, Jacob Marley, had died seven years before, at Christmas. Marley was like Scrooge when he was alive. But now he was gone. Or was he?</p> 
 <p><strong>AT SCROOGE'S HOUSE</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Who's there? I'm finally home and I want some peace!</p> 
 <p><strong>Marley<br /></strong>Scroooge... Scrooooooge...</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>What is this? A ghost?! It's not possible! I must be having indigestion and seeing things that aren't there!</p> 
 <p><strong>Marley<br /></strong>Scrooge. In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.</p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Marley, is it really you?! And what is this strange metal chain you are wearing? It's made of cash-boxes, keys, locks, heavy purses...</p> 
 <p><strong>Marley<br /></strong>I wear the chain I made in life. Of my own free will I wore it when I was alive. Is its pattern strange to you? Or do you wish to know the weight and length of the heavy chain you are carrying yourself?<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Scrooge<br /></strong>Don't say that, Jacob. And why is this happening to you? You were always a good man of business…</p> 
 <p><strong>Marley<br /></strong>Business!? Mankind was my business. Charity, kindness - were all my business. Why did I walk through crowds of people with my eyes turned down? I'm here to warn you, that you still have a chance of escaping my fate. You'll be visited by three spirits. Expect the first spirit tomorrow at one o'clock in the morning. And remember what I've told you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Marley disappeared into the night, flying out of an open window with other ghosts which looked as miserable as him. Scrooge was shocked. I'll tell you about the visit of the first spirit next time.</p>
