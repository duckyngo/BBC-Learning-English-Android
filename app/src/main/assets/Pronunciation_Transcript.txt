"<p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Hi. I'm Tim and this is my Pronunciation workshop. Here I'm going to show you how English is really spoken. Come on, let's go inside.&nbsp;Well, here we are in the pronunciation workshop for the final time. Today, let's look back on what we've covered in this series and I'll offer some final tips and words of advice. When we write English, each word is separate; there are spaces between the words. But, that's not how we speak English. If. We. Did. It. Might. Be. Easier. To. Understand. But. We. Would. Sound. Like. Robots. No. When we speak English, although there are some pauses, we mostly bump the words together. And when these words bump into each other certain things can happen that affect the sounds. We've learned that /t/ and /d/ sounds disappear between consonants:</p>
 <p><strong>Example<br /></strong>'Mashe<strong>d p</strong>otato' becomes&nbsp;<strong>/m&aelig;ʃpəˈteɪtəʊ/</strong>.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Consonant sounds can link with vowel sounds:</p>
 <p><strong>Example<br /></strong>'A<strong>n e</strong>gg' becomes&nbsp;<strong>anegg</strong>.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Certain vowel sounds can link with certain other vowel sounds by adding sounds:</p>
 <p><strong>Example<br /></strong>'The sho<strong>e i</strong>s…' becomes&nbsp;<strong>the shoe/w/is</strong>…</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Two consonant sounds can join together, or twin.</p>
 <p><strong>Example<br /></strong>'I<strong>t t</strong>akes two' becomes&nbsp;<strong>/ɪt:eɪks tuː/</strong>.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Some sounds can change completely:</p>
 <p><strong>Example<br /></strong>'Green Park'&nbsp;<strong>/griːn pɑːk/</strong>&nbsp;becomes&nbsp;<strong>/griːmpɑːk/</strong>.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Unstressed grammar words are often weak:</p>
 <p><strong>Example<br /></strong>'I'd have been late' becomes<strong>&nbsp;/aɪdəv bɪn leɪt/</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>And we've also seen how a little sound, schwa, is important to the rhythm of natural spoken English.</p>
 <p><strong>Example<br /></strong>'A piece of cake'&nbsp;<strong>/ə piːsə keɪk/</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>These are all features of what we call connected speech. Natural speech is full of these features. And for native speakers, these changes happen automatically. The more you can get used to listening to and speaking English, the more naturally they'll come to you too. But my advice is that the most important thing to pay attention to is schwa. Getting schwa in the right place is the first step to getting English pronunciation right. And that, for the last time, is about it from the pronunciation workshop. And always remember that if you want to learn more about pronunciation or other aspects of English, then please visit our website, bbclearningenglish.com. Thank you so much for watching this series and I'll see you soon. Bye bye! Erm, hello? Hello? Erm. I can't get out. What do I do? Help! Help! Oh. Somebody?</p>

"<p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Hi. I'm Tim and this is my Pronunciation workshop. Here I'm going to show you how English is really spoken. Come on, let's go inside.&nbsp;When you meet someone for the first time, there are several things you can say. If you want to be formal, you could say 'How do you do?' But there is another, less formal expression. Do you know what it is? Let's meet some of the people of London.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>It's nice to meet you.<br />Nice to meet you.<br />Nice to meet you.<br />It's nice to meet you.<br />Nice to meet you.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong>&nbsp;<br />Well, it's nice to meet you too. Now, the word 'meet' ends in the sound /t/, and the word 'you' begins with /j/, don't they? Or do they? Listen again. What can you actually hear when these two sounds come together?</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>It's nice to mee<strong>t y</strong>ou.<br />Nice to mee<strong>t y</strong>ou.<br />Nice to mee<strong>t y</strong>ou.<br />It's nice to mee<strong>t y</strong>ou.<br />Nice to mee<strong>t y</strong>ou.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong>&nbsp;<br />In fluent speech, when one word ends in /t/ and the next begins with a /j/ sound, like 'you' or 'yours', then the two sounds come together and change to /ʧ/. So 'meet you' becomes&nbsp;<strong>/mi</strong><strong>ːʧ</strong><strong>u</strong><strong>ː</strong><strong>/</strong>. This is an example of assimilation. Now you might remember that in a previous video I mentioned that the /t/ sound can disappear in between two consonants. Well, this can still happen if the next word is 'you' or 'your', but it's more usual for the /t/ to change to /ʧ/ in this case. Here are some more examples.</p>
 <p><strong>Examples</strong><br />That shirt won't sui<strong>t y</strong>ou.<br />Don'<strong>t y</strong>ou want to come to the party?<br />I be<strong>t y</strong>our boss doesn’t know.<br />Can I ge<strong>t y</strong>ou anything?</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Right, so you've heard the examples, and now it's your turn. Are you ready to start? Listen and repeat.</p>
 <p><strong>Examples</strong><br />That shirt won't sui<strong>t y</strong>ou.<br />Don’<strong>t y</strong>ou want to come to the party?<br />I be<strong>t y</strong>our boss doesn’t know.<br />Can I ge<strong>t y</strong>ou anything?</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br />Well done. Now remember, if you want to learn more about pronunciation, then please visit our website, bbclearningenglish.com. And that is about it from the pronunciation workshop for this week. I'll see you soon. Bye bye! &nbsp;Ugh. That is not right.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Hello.</p>
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Hello, is that Tim? It's Tom.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Oh hi, Tom. Yeah it's Tim.</p>
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>So, did you enjoy your tea?</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>No. It was disgusting.</p>
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Ha ha, that's because I put salt in, instead of sugar - gotcha!</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Why, you little... I'm gonna get you. I have a very particular set of skills. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. I will hunt you down. I will find you. And I will put shaving cream on your pillow. Brothers, eh?! Well I guess that goes to show that you can't always get what you want. Now, time to start plotting my revenge. Idiot.</p>

"<p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Hi. I'm Tim and this is my Pronunciation workshop. Here I'm going to show you how English is really spoken. Come on, let's go inside.&nbsp;Now, these days, when you go to a real shop do you prefer to pay by cash or by plastic? What do we call one of these? Now, I'm sure you already know, but let's hear what the people of London call it.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>It’s a credit card.<br />Credit card.<br />Credit card.<br />Credit card.<br />Credit card.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong>&nbsp;<br />A credit card. Now, the word 'credit' ends in the sound /t/, doesn't it? Or does it? Watch and listen again. What sound can you actually hear?</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>It’s a credi<strong>t c</strong>ard.<br />Credi<strong>t c</strong>ard.<br />Credi<strong>t c</strong>ard.<br />Credi<strong>t c</strong>ard.<br />Credi<strong>t c</strong>ard.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong>&nbsp;<br />In fluent speech, when one word ends in a&nbsp;<strong>vowel sound</strong>&nbsp;followed by a&nbsp;<strong>/t/</strong>&nbsp;and the next word&nbsp;<strong>begins with a /k/</strong>, the&nbsp;<strong>/t/ changes to a /k/</strong>. So /kredɪt kɑːd/ becomes /kredɪk kɑːd/. It's an example of assimilation. And here are some more examples.</p>
 <p><strong>Examples</strong><br />Don't let it ge<strong>t c</strong>old!<br />You have to do i<strong>t q</strong>uickly.<br />There's no shor<strong>t c</strong>ut to learning a language.<br />I didn't like tha<strong>t c</strong>ake.</p>

"<p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Hi. I'm Tim and this is my Pronunciation workshop. Here I'm going to show you how English is really spoken. Come on, let's go inside.&nbsp;Now, if you’ve been following my adventures in this workshop, you will know that I have had a bit of bad luck, now and then. But not half as much bad luck as this chap. Listen to what these people are saying about him.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>He looks like he’s had an accident.<br />He looks like he’s had an accident.<br />He looks like he’s had an accident.<br />He looks like he’s had an accident.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong>&nbsp;<br />Now, they all used the word ‘he’ twice. But there were two different pronunciations. Listen out for them both as you watch again.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong><strong>He</strong>&nbsp;looks like&nbsp;<strong>he</strong>’s had an accident.<br /><strong>He</strong>&nbsp;looks like&nbsp;<strong>he</strong>’s had an accident.<br /><strong>He</strong>&nbsp;looks like&nbsp;<strong>he</strong>’s had an accident.<br /><strong>He</strong>&nbsp;looks like&nbsp;<strong>he</strong>’s had an accident.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong>&nbsp;<br />In fluent speech, if the word ‘he’ comes at the beginning of a sentence or clause, then the ‘h’ sound /h/ is pronounced. But if it comes in the middle of a sentence or clause and after a consonant, then the ‘h’ sound is not usually pronounced. So&nbsp;<strong>/hi</strong><strong>ː</strong><strong>/</strong>&nbsp;becomes&nbsp;<strong>/i</strong><strong>ː</strong><strong>/</strong>&nbsp;and ‘he looks like&nbsp;<strong>he</strong>’s had an accident’ becomes ‘he looks like ‘<strong>e</strong>’s had an accident’. Not this change also happens with certain other words beginning with the ‘h’ sound, like&nbsp;<strong>him</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>his</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>her</strong>. Here are some more examples.</p>
 <p><strong>Examples</strong><br />I really like&nbsp;<strong>his</strong>&nbsp;cooking.<br />We think&nbsp;<strong>he</strong>’s left the country.<br />They let&nbsp;<strong>him</strong>&nbsp;leave early.<br />They offered&nbsp;<strong>her</strong>&nbsp;a promotion.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br />Right, so you’ve heard the examples, and now it’s your turn. You know the drill by now. Listen and repeat.</p>
 <p><strong>Examples</strong><br />I really like&nbsp;<strong>his</strong>&nbsp;cooking.<br />We think&nbsp;<strong>he</strong>’s left the country.<br />They let&nbsp;<strong>him</strong>&nbsp;leave early.<br />They offered&nbsp;<strong>her</strong>&nbsp;a promotion.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br />Well done. Now remember, if you want to learn more about pronunciation, then please visit our website, bbclearningenglish.com. And that is about it from the pronunciation workshop for this week. I'll see you soon. Bye bye! Now, that man in the photograph – his head looked a bit sore – which reminds me. Saw! I love DIY! Actually, I am a bit accident-prone. But my twin Tom is very good with his hands. I think I’ll give him a ring and ask for his advice. Ow! Every time!</p>

"<p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Hi. I'm Tim and this is my Pronunciation workshop. Here I'm going to show you how English is really spoken. Come on, let's go inside.&nbsp;Phew, just made it. A little bit late today. My alarm didn’t go off this morning, so, I nearly missed the bus.</p>
 <p><strong>Voice<br /></strong>Err... Tim, why do you need a bus to get to the shed at the end of your garden?</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Well, you know it’s a really big garden.</p>
 <p><strong>Voice<br /></strong>Really?</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>OK, fine. Look, I’ll let you into a little secret. This actually isn’t my workshop. I’ve been borrowing it from a friend. Anyway, I nearly missed the bus, but I didn’t. So, let’s ask some people in London what they would do if their alarms hadn’t gone off this morning.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>If my alarm hadn’t gone off this morning, I’d’ve missed the bus.<br />I’d’ve stayed home.<br />I’d’ve woken up anyway.<br />I’d’ve been late for work.<br />I’d’ve missed the train.<br />I’d’ve stayed in bed.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong> <br /> In an earlier video we saw that the verb ‘have’ is pronounced as /h&aelig;f/ when it’s used in its modal form. But this isn’t the only way the pronunciation of ‘have’ can change. Watch and listen again. Can you hear how they pronounce it differently?</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>If my alarm hadn’t gone off this morning, I’d<strong>’ve</strong> missed the bus.<br />I’d<strong>’ve</strong> stayed home.<br />I’d<strong>’ve</strong> woken up anyway.<br />I’d<strong>’ve</strong> been late for work.<br />I’d<strong>’ve</strong> missed the train.<br />I’d<strong>’ve</strong> stayed in bed.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong> <br /> When the verb <strong>have</strong>&nbsp;is used as an auxiliary it’s often contracted. And when it comes after a consonant sound it’s pronounced /əv/. So, ‘I’d have been late’ becomes ‘I’d’ve been late’. This pronunciation is very common in conditional sentences, but it’s not the only time you’ll hear it. Here are some more examples.<strong><br /></strong></p>
 <p><strong>Examples</strong><br /> Your parcel should<strong>’ve</strong> been delivered yesterday.<br />I would<strong>’ve</strong> done it differently.<br />We might<strong>’ve</strong> made a mistake.<br />The police<strong>’ve</strong> arrived.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Right, so you’ve heard the examples, and now it’s your turn. Listen and repeat.</p>
 <p><strong>Examples</strong><br /> Your parcel should<strong>’ve</strong> been delivered yesterday.<br />I would<strong>’ve</strong> done it differently.<br />We might<strong>’ve</strong> made a mistake.<br />The police<strong>’ve</strong> arrived.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br /> Well done. Now remember, if you want to learn more about pronunciation, then please visit our website, bbclearningenglish.com. And that is about it from the pronunciation workshop for this week. I'll see you soon. Bye bye! OK, now how does this alarm work? I guess I should’ve read the instructions! That was really loud!</p>

"<p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Hi. I'm Tim and this is my Pronunciation workshop. Here I'm going to show you how English is really spoken. Come on, let's go inside.&nbsp;Now, do you know the word speeb? No, of course not because it’s not a real word. Or is it? Listen to some people in London talking about this.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>It’s a speed boat.<br />Speed boat.<br />Speed boat.<br />Speed boat.<br />Speed boat.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong> <br /> Now, the word speed ends in the sound /d/, doesn’t it? Well not always. Watch and listen again, what sound can you actually hear?</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>It’s a spee<strong>? b</strong>oat.<br />Spee<strong>? b</strong>oat.<br />Spee<strong>? b</strong>oat.<br />Spee<strong>? b</strong>oat.<br />Spee<strong>? b</strong>oat.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>In everyday speech, when we’re speaking fluently, if one word ends in a <strong>vowel</strong> sound followed by a <strong>/d/</strong> and the next begins in a <strong>/b/</strong>, then the <strong>/d/</strong> changes to a <strong>/b/</strong> and then merges with the <strong>/b/ from the following word</strong>. So ‘speed boat’, becomes ‘spee<strong>bb</strong>oat’. Watch again, this time in slow motion. Look at the mouth shape. Can you see /d/ or is it just /b/?</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>Spee<strong>b b</strong>oat.<br />Spee<strong>b b</strong>oat.<br />Spee<strong>b b</strong>oat.<br />Spee<strong>b b</strong>oat.<br />Spee<strong>b b</strong>oat.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>This is another case of assimilation.&nbsp;Here are some more examples.</p>
 <p><strong> Examples</strong><br />My son is a really goo<strong>d b</strong>oy.<br />I’m sorry if I was ru<strong>de b</strong>efore.<br />My car had to be towe<strong>d b</strong>ack to the garage.<br />You shoul<strong>d b</strong>uy him a present.</p>

 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br /> Well done. And remember, if you want to learn more about pronunciation, then please visit our website, bbclearningenglish.com. And that is about it from the pronunciation workshop for this week. I’ll see you soon. Bye bye! Aah – you know, one day I’m going to get one of these. Not a toy, obviously, but the real thing. My dad promised. He said if I was a good boy he’d buy me a boat. That was quite a long time ago actually. I think I was five years old – and I have been a good boy. Maybe he’s just forgotten. I’m never going to get my speed boat, am I?</p>

"<p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Hi. I'm Tim and this is my Pronunciation workshop. Here I'm going to show you how English is really spoken. Come on. Let’s go inside. How do you ask for help? And what is the connection between this… and this? Well, this is a piece of what? And what is the female version of this animal called? Put them together and what do you get? Well, here’s how some people in London ask for help.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>Would you do me a favour?<br />Would you do me a favour?<br />Would you do me a favour?<br />Would you do me a favour?<br />Would you do me a favour?</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong> <br /> Wood. Ewe. Would you – get it? Now, the words ‘ewe’ and ‘you’ have the same pronunciation, don’t they? But what happens to the word ‘you’ when it comes after the sound /d/? Watch and listen again</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>Woul<strong>d you</strong> do me a favour?<br />Woul<strong>d you</strong> do me a favour?<br />Woul<strong>d you</strong> do me a favour?<br />Woul<strong>d you</strong> do me a favour?<br />Woul<strong>d you</strong> do me a favour?</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong> <br /> In fluent speech when one word ends in a /d/ sound and the next word begins in a /j/ sound, the two sounds come together and change to a /ʤ/ sound. You also might have noticed that the /uː/ in 'you' can change to schwa. So 'would you' becomes 'woul<strong>/ʤ/</strong>ou', or even ‘woul<strong>/ʤə/</strong>’ This is an example of assimilation. Here are some more examples.</p>
 <p><strong> Examples</strong><br />I’m sa<strong>d you</strong> decided to quit.<br />Coul<strong>d you</strong> get here by midnight?<br />Shoul<strong>d you</strong> see him, can you give him a message?<br />I don’t think the gol<strong>d you</strong> bought was real.</p>

"<p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Hi. I'm Tim and this is my Pronunciation workshop. Here I'm going to show you how English is really spoken. Come on, let's go inside. This week, I’m going to need some help from my favourite twin. Please welcome back Tom, who’s going to help me present. Hi Tom!</p>
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Hi Tim! Now, are you a lover?</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Or a fighter? Do you prefer to dance?</p>
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Or would you rather have an argument?</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>There’s an expression we have in English that contains the name of a dance …</p>
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>… and means when two people get involved in a fight or argument, then in most cases both have to take some of the responsibility. Do you know the expression?</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Well, let’s ask the people of London.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>It takes two to tango.<br />It takes two to tango.<br />It takes two to tango.<br />It takes two to tango.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim and Tom</strong><br />It takes two to tango.</p>
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Lot of ‘t’s in that, Tim.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Lot of ‘t’s indeed, Tom. Five in fact. It takes two to Tango. But are all of these usually pronounced? Can you hear all of them? Listen again.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>I<strong>t t</strong>akes two to tango.<br />I<strong>t t</strong>akes two to tango.<br />I<strong>t t</strong>akes two to tango.<br />I<strong>t t</strong>akes two to tango.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong>&nbsp;<br />You might remember from a previous video that when the sound /t/ comes in between two consonants, we don’t usually pronounce it.</p>
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>But what happens if there is a vowel sound before the /t/? and the next word also begins with /t/?</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Well, in this case the two /t/ sounds join together to create one slightly stronger /t/. So ‘it takes two’ becomes 'i<strong>t t</strong>akes two'. This is an example of twinning or gemination. Here are some more examples.</p>
 <p><strong>Examples</strong><br />I<strong>t t</strong>ook him twenty years to ge<strong>t t</strong>o the top.<br />You don’t have to chea<strong>t t</strong>o pass the test.<br />You were righ<strong>t t</strong>o be upset.<br />We took the overnigh<strong>t t</strong>rain to Venice.</p>

"<p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Hi. I'm Tim and this is my Pronunciation workshop. Here I'm going to show you how English is really spoken. Come on, let's go inside.&nbsp;Where were you born? Where do you come from? Here's what we heard when we asked some people in London their names, and where they come from.</p>
 <p><br /><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>My name's Charlotte, and I'm from Darwin in Lancashire.<br />My name's Ollie, and I'm from Norfolk.<br />I'm Amy from London.<br />Allie, I'm from Northern Ireland.<br />My name's Victoria. I'm from Cambridge.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong>&nbsp;<br />Now they all used the word&nbsp;<strong>from</strong>, didn't they - but they didn't pronounce it /frɒm/. Listen again: how&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;it pronounced?<br /><strong><br />Voxpops<br /></strong>My name's Charlotte, and I'm from Darwin in Lancashire.<br />My name's Ollie, and I'm from Norfolk.<br />I'm Amy from London.<br />Allie, I'm from Northern Ireland.<br />My name's Victoria - I'm from Cambridge.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong>&nbsp;<br />The word&nbsp;<strong>from</strong>&nbsp;is a preposition; it's usually not that important in a sentence, so it's often unstressed. Now, at the end of the question, &quot;Where do you come from?&quot; It's unstressed, but it is still pronounced /frɒm/. However, when it's unstressed, and it comes in the middle of a sentence, the /ɒ/ changes to schwa, so /frɒm/ becomes /frəm/. This is an example of a weak form, and here are some more examples.<br /><strong><br />Examples</strong><br />I borrowed it&nbsp;<strong>from</strong>&nbsp;my brother.<br />I read the book&nbsp;<strong>from</strong>&nbsp;cover to cover.<br />The nearest post office is not far&nbsp;<strong>from</strong>&nbsp;here.<br />Come over any time&nbsp;<strong>from</strong>&nbsp;seven o'clock.</p>

"<p><strong>Tim</strong>&nbsp;<br />Hi. I'm Tim and this is my Pronunciation workshop. Here I'm going to show you how English is really spoken. Come on, let's go inside.&nbsp;You know how they say that British people are obsessed with the weather? Well I'm feeling under it today. Under the weather – that's an expression which means 'I'm not feeling very well'. Excuse me! What do you say in your language when someone sneezes? Do you know what we say in British English? Let's ask the people of London.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops</strong>&nbsp;<br />Bless you.<br />Bless you.<br />Bless you.<br />Bless you.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Tim</strong>&nbsp;<br />Thank you! Bless you! Now the word 'bless' ends in /s/ and 'you' begins with /j/. But what happens to the /s/ sound when we put the two words together? Watch and listen again.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops</strong>&nbsp;<br />Bless you.<br />Bless you.<br />Bless you.<br />Bless you.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong>&nbsp;<br />In fluent speech, when a /s/ sound is followed by a /j/ then the /s/ changes to a /ʃ/ sound, and this change also happens if the next word begins with the /ʃ/ sound itself. So 'bless you' becomes 'bleshyou' and 'this shirt' becomes 'thishirt'. This is an example of assimilation. And don't forget this can also happen if the /s/ is followed by a /t/, because as you might remember from a previous video, the /t/ sound disappears between two consonants. Here are some more examples.</p>
 <p><strong>Examples</strong>&nbsp;<br />Can you just shut the door please?!<br />This yacht is beautiful.<br />Don't worry, that's usual.<br />He always makes you feel good.<br /><br /><strong>Tim</strong><br />Right, so you've heard the examples, and now it's your turn. Listen and repeat.</p>

"<p><strong>Tim</strong><br />Hi. I'm Tim and this is my Pronunciation Workshop. Here, I'm going to show you how English is really spoken. Come on, let's go inside.&nbsp;Today, I'm going to use two things to help me demonstrate a feature of English pronunciation. This is a bin and this is a bean. What's the connection? Well, I'm sure you know the past participle of the verb 'to be' – 'been', right? Well, we asked some people how long they had been in London.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops</strong><br />I've been in London seventeen years.<br />I have been in London seven years.<br />I've been in London for more than a year now.<br />I've been in London every summer since I was eighteen.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong>&nbsp;<br />Now, they all used the word 'been' – but nobody actually said 'been'. Listen again. What word do you actually hear them say?&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>I've been in London seventeen years.<br />I have been in London seven years.<br />I've been in London for more than a year now.<br />I've been in London every summer since I was eighteen.<br /><br /><strong>Tim</strong>&nbsp;<br />In fluent everyday English, when the auxiliary 'been' is not stressed its pronunciation changes to /bɪn/. 'I've been in London since 2015' becomes 'I've /bɪn/ in London since 2015'. This is what's known as a weak form and it helps speech to flow more naturally and fluently. Here are some more examples.<br /><strong><br />Examples</strong><br />I've&nbsp;<strong>been</strong>&nbsp;working here for several years.<br />How long have you&nbsp;<strong>been</strong>&nbsp;waiting?<br />It's&nbsp;<strong>been</strong>&nbsp;years since I went to the cinema.<br />What have you&nbsp;<strong>been</strong>&nbsp;up to since we last met?</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>So you've heard the examples, and now it's your turn. You know the drill: listen and repeat.</p>

"<p><strong>Tim</strong><br />Hi. I'm Tim and this is my Pronunciation workshop. Here I'm going to show you how English is really spoken. Come on, let's go inside. Are you a creature of habit? For example, do you have a routine in the mornings? Every morning, I like to have a cup of tea and a chocolate biscuit. Mmmm. This is what some people in London told us when we asked them what they do in the mornings</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops</strong><br />I always have some breakfast.<br />I always go to the gym in the morning.<br />I always drink a glass of warm water when I wake up.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br />One thing that happens when we speak English fluently is that we sometimes add sounds between words to help link them together more smoothly and easily. Listen again. Can you hear another sound between the words&nbsp;<strong>I</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>always</strong>?</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops</strong><br />I always have some breakfast.<br />I always go to the gym in the morning.<br />I always drink a glass of warm water when I wake up.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br />Did you catch it? It’s hardly there but when one word ends in /aɪ/, /ɪː/, /eɪ/ or/ɔɪ/ sound, and the next word begins in a vowel sound, we can smooth the link out by adding a small /j/ sound.&nbsp;<strong>I always</strong>&nbsp;[slowly] becomes<strong>&nbsp;I always</strong>&nbsp;[fluently]. This is sometimes called the linking /j/. But be careful, your mouth normally does this naturally as your mouth changes shape between the sounds. You don’t actually want to add a full /j/ sound. Here are some more examples.</p>
 <p><strong>Examples</strong><br />When I go on holiday I just want to&nbsp;<strong>lie on</strong>&nbsp;the beach.<br /><strong>The end</strong>&nbsp;of the film was brilliant.<br /><strong>I ate</strong>&nbsp;the whole cake in one go.<br />It was too&nbsp;<strong>high up</strong>&nbsp;for me to reach.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br />Right, now you've heard the examples, and now it's your turn. You know the drill: listen and repeat.</p>

"<p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Hi. I'm Tim and this is my Pronunciation workshop. Here I'm going to show you how English is really spoken. Come on, let's go inside.&nbsp;You know, I’ve been thinking about decorating my workshop – bringing a little bit of colour to it. But I can’t decide between blue or orange. Hmm. Let’s ask the people of London.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>I prefer the blue one to the orange one.<br />I prefer the blue one to the orange one.<br />I prefer the blue one to the orange one.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong>&nbsp;<br />That sounds pretty comprehensive. Blue it is. I'll go in and get the paints. Ooh, but first, let’s talk about pronunciation. Now, everyone used the definite article –&nbsp;<strong>the</strong>&nbsp;– and in each case it wasn’t stressed, but the pronunciation was slightly different. I'm going to go in and get the paints: you listen again and see if you can hear the two different ways the definite article is pronounced. I'll see you inside.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>I prefer&nbsp;<strong>the</strong>&nbsp;blue one to&nbsp;<strong>the</strong>&nbsp;orange one.<br />I prefer&nbsp;<strong>the</strong>&nbsp;blue one to&nbsp;<strong>the</strong>&nbsp;orange one.<br />I prefer&nbsp;<strong>the</strong>&nbsp;blue one to&nbsp;<strong>the</strong>&nbsp;orange one.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>If it’s not stressed, the pronunciation of the word&nbsp;<strong>the</strong>&nbsp;will change depending on the word that follows. If the next word begins in a consonant sound, it’s pronounced /&eth;ə/. I prefer&nbsp;<strong>the blue</strong>&nbsp;one. But, if the next word begins in a vowel sound, it’s pronounced /&eth;ɪː/. I prefer&nbsp;<strong>the orange</strong>&nbsp;one. And you might remember from a previous video that when the sound /ɪː/ is followed by a vowel sound, you might also hear a small linking /j/ in between. I prefer&nbsp;<strong>the orange</strong>&nbsp;one. Here are some more examples.</p>
 <p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>In a restaurant, I always order&nbsp;<strong>the</strong>&nbsp;apple pie.<br />I think&nbsp;<strong>the</strong>&nbsp;autumn is&nbsp;<strong>the</strong>&nbsp;best time of year.<br /><strong>The</strong>&nbsp;earlier I get up,&nbsp;<strong>the</strong>&nbsp;happier I am.<br />It’s&nbsp;<strong>the</strong>&nbsp;one over there.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>So you've heard the examples, and now it's your turn. Listen and repeat.</p>

"<p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Hi. I'm Tim and this is my pronunciation workshop. Here I'm going to show you how English is really spoken. Come on, let's go inside.&nbsp;Wow. Isn't the world an amazing place? Look how many countries there are! Well – at least ten! Do you like travelling? How many countries have you visited? Now, is there any particular place, or country, that you'd like to visit? This is what the people of London told us when we asked them that same question.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops</strong><br />I'd like to visit Iceland.<br />I'd like to visit South America.<br />I'd like to visit Spain and Greece.<br />I'd love to go to Egypt.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br />The contraction 'I'd' ends in the sound /d/, doesn’t it? Or does it? Listen again - can you fully hear the /d/?</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops</strong><br />I'd like to visit Iceland.<br />I'd like to visit South America.<br />I'd like to visit Spain and Greece.<br />I'd love to go to Egypt.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br />We make the sounds of English in different ways, using different parts of our mouths. There's a group of consonants called plosives, and if this sounds a bit like the word 'explosion', well, that's not a bad way of remembering it. Plosive sounds are made by suddenly releasing air that has been blocked by various parts of the mouth. The sound /d/ is one of these plosives. The others are /b/, /t/, /p/, /k/ and /g/. But in fluent, everyday speech, when one word ends in a plosive sound and the next begins in another consonant sound, we don’t always hear the release of the plosive sound. 'I'd like to', becomes 'Idliketuh'. This is called 'an unreleased stop', or, if you want to get really technical, 'a stop with no audible release'. Here are some more examples.</p>
 <p><strong>Examples</strong><br />How about a qui<strong>ck</strong>&nbsp;<strong>ch</strong>at?<br />You shoul<strong>d</strong>&nbsp;<strong>th</strong>ank her.<br />It was a sa<strong>d</strong>&nbsp;<strong>t</strong>ime in his life.<br />Why don't you si<strong>t</strong>&nbsp;<strong>d</strong>own?</p>

"<p><strong>Tim</strong><br />Hi. I'm Tim and this is my pronunciation workshop. Here, I'm going to show you how English is really spoken. Come on, let's go inside. You see this? This is my lunch - well, either that, or it's some cat food. Anyway, do you know what we call this container? It's a can, right? Now this has the same spelling as the modal 'can', and the same pronunciation, hasn't it? Or has it? Listen carefully when we ask some people in London how many languages they speak.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops</strong><br />I can speak one language.<br />I can speak two languages.<br />I can speak two languages.<br />I can speak two languages, English and Hindi.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br />They all used the word 'can'. But they didn't pronounce it as /k&aelig;n/. Listen again. How do they pronounce it?<br /><br /><strong>Voxpops</strong><br />I can speak one language.<br />I can speak two languages.<br />I can speak two languages.<br />I can speak two languages, English and Hindi.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br />In fluent everyday English, when the modal auxiliary 'can' is unstressed, its pronunciation changes to /kən/. 'I /k&aelig;n/ speak four languages' becomes: 'I /kən/ speak four languages'. This is what's known as a weak form and it can occur in questions as well. Here are some more examples.<br /><br /><strong>Examples</strong><br />Can you help me bring in the shopping, please?<br />I can swim further than I can run.<br />You can succeed if you work hard.<br />How far can you throw a tennis ball?<br /><br /><strong>Tim</strong><br />Right, so you've heard the examples, and now it's your turn.

"<p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Hi. I'm Tim and this is my Pronunciation workshop. Here I'm going to show you how English is really spoken. Are you ready? Come on, let's go inside. In English, we have an expression – man’s best friend. Do you know what that refers to? No, not beer. Dogs. A dog is man’s best friend. But not always. What would you say to a dog who did this?</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops</strong><br />Bad girl!<br />She's a bad girl!<br />The dog has been a bad girl!</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br />Now, the word bad ends in /g/ doesn’t it? Or does it? Watch and listen again. Can you hear the /d/?</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>Bad girl!<br />She's a bad girl!<br />The dog has been a bad girl!</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br />In fluent speech, a /d/ changes to a /g/ when it comes before a /g/ or a /k/. So 'bad girl' becomes 'bagirl'. This is an example of what is called assimilation. Here are some more.</p>
 <p><strong>Examples</strong><br />He’s a really good cook.<br />Last night we had guests for dinner.<br />Can you print out the hard copy?<br />I’d love to walk down the red carpet one day.</p>

"<p><strong>Tim</strong><br />Hi. I'm Tim and this is my Pronunciation Workshop. Here, I'm going to show you how English is really spoken. Come on, let's go inside. Today, I'm going to tell you about perhaps the most common feature of fluent English pronunciation. And to help me, I’m going to use one of these. Now, I know you know what it is, but let's ask the people of London to describe it.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops</strong><br />He's holding an egg.<br />He's holding an egg.<br />He's holding an egg.<br />He's holding an egg.<br />He's holding an egg.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br />An egg – that's two words, right? But, when we pronounce them, there's no gap in between them. It almost sounds like one word. Listen again.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops</strong><br />He's holding an egg.<br />He's holding an egg.<br />He's holding an egg.<br />He's holding an egg.<br />He's holding an egg.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br />In fluent English, when one word ends in a consonant sound and the next word begins in a vowel sound, we link the two sounds together without a pause in between them. So,&nbsp;<strong>an egg</strong>&nbsp;becomes&nbsp;<strong>anegg</strong>. This is called catenation. Here are some more examples.</p>
 <p><strong>Examples</strong><br /><strong>He’s in</strong>&nbsp;the garden.<br />I used to&nbsp;<strong>believe in</strong>&nbsp;Father Christmas, but&nbsp;<strong>not any</strong>&nbsp;more.<br />I had to<strong>&nbsp;give up</strong>&nbsp;jogging.<br />He&nbsp;<strong>had it</strong>&nbsp;in his office.</p>

"<p><strong>Tim</strong><br />Hi. I'm Tim and this is my Pronunciation Workshop. Here, I'm going to show you how English is really spoken. Come on, let's go inside. Oh dear, excuse me. I’m a bit tired: I was out late last night, with the lads. I know, yeah, we didn't get back until 9.30. In the evening. It was a wild night. I know, I know, I am a party animal. Anyway, while I get myself together a bit, let's ask some other people in London what they got up to last night.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops</strong><br />At 9 o'clock last night I was watching a movie.<br />I was laying in bed.<br />I was invited to a dinner at my friend's house.<br />I was playing football<br />I was out drinking.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br />Well well, what interesting lives we all lead. Now they all used the past form of the verb 'to be' –&nbsp;<strong>was</strong>. Now the word&nbsp;<strong>was</strong>&nbsp;is made of the sounds /w/, /ɔ:/, / z/, isn’t it? Or is it? Listen again. What sound can you actually hear?</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops</strong><br />At 9 o'clock last night I was watching a movie.<br />I was laying in bed.<br />I was invited to a dinner at my friend's house.<br />I was playing football<br />I was out drinking.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>When the word&nbsp;<strong>was</strong>&nbsp;is unstressed, as in the examples we’ve just heard, then the vowel sound changes to a schwa - /ə/. So&nbsp;<strong>was</strong>&nbsp;becomes /wəz/, and also&nbsp;<strong>were</strong>&nbsp;becomes /wə/. These are called weak forms. Here are some more examples.</p>
 <p><strong>Examples</strong><br />I was there when it happened.<br />We were delighted with the results.<br />We were having a good time until it rained.<br />He was feeling much better last night.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br />Right, now you've heard the examples, and now it's your turn. Listen and repeat.</p>

"<p><strong>Tim</strong><br />Hi. I'm Tim and this is my Pronunciation Workshop. Here, I'm going to show you how English is really spoken. Come on, let's go inside. Hey, look at this: a present. All wrapped up in paper. Now, do you know what this is? Well, if you could smell it, it might give you a clue.</p>
 <p><strong>Voice</strong><br />Is it your old socks?</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br />Very funny – No. No, it's not my old socks. It's something much, much nicer. Something delicious in fact. Let's ask the people of London if they can tell what it is, without seeing it.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops</strong><br />Fish and chips.<br />Fish and chips.<br />Fish and chips.<br />Fish and chips.<br />Fish and chips.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br />Yes, that's right. It's good old fish and chips. I'm going to save that for later. Now the word&nbsp;<strong>and</strong>&nbsp;has got three sounds, hasn't it? /&aelig;/, /n/, /d/ - but listen again. How is it pronounced in everyday speech?</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops</strong><br />Fish and chips.<br />Fish and chips.<br />Fish and chips.<br />Fish and chips.<br />Fish and chips.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br /><strong>And</strong>&nbsp;is not usually an important word. It’s a basic conjunction and it's frequently unstressed. When this happens, the /d/ at the end of the word disappears before both vowels and consonants, and the vowel sound at the beginning of the word changes to schwa: /ə/, so&nbsp;<strong>and</strong>&nbsp;becomes /ən/ or even /n/ as the sounds are almost identical. Here are some more examples.</p>
 <p><strong>Examples</strong><br />I'm going to go and get the shopping.<br />Apples and oranges are my favourite fruits.<br />I’ve been thinking and thinking but I can't decide.<br />We went for a coffee and something to eat.</p>

What is going on? Where's the…? It really is fish… and ships! Well that is the last time I'm telling that joke. This is no laughing matter. I'm hungry now…</p>

"<p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Hi. I'm Tim and this is my Pronunciation workshop. Here I'm going to show you how English is really spoken. It'll help you to become a better listener and a more fluent speaker. Are you ready? Come on, follow me.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Now, are you an early bird? Do you catch the worm? Do you even have the faintest idea what I’m talking about? Well, in English, an early bird is someone who gets up early in the morning. Now I&nbsp;hate waking up early, but because of my job sometimes I&nbsp;have to get up before 11 o'clock in the morning. I know - that's&nbsp;terrible, but I do it, just for you.&nbsp;Let’s find out about some other Londoners.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops</strong><br />I have to get up in the morning at six a.m.<br />I have to get up at half past six every morning.<br />I have to get up in the morning at 6.45.<br />I have to get up at 8 o'clock.<br />I have to get up at 5 or 6 o'clock.<br />I have to get up at half six.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br />The word ‘have’ ends in the sound /v/, doesn’t it -&nbsp;or does it? Listen again: what sound can you actually hear? Also, pay attention to the pronunciation of the word&nbsp;‘to’.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops</strong><br />I have to get up in the morning at&nbsp;six a.m.<br />I have to get up at half past six every morning.<br />I have to get up in the morning at 6.45.<br />I have to get up at 8 o'clock.<br />I have to get up at&nbsp;5 or 6&nbsp;o'clock.<br />I have to get up at half six.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br />When we use the verb ‘have’ in its modal form: ‘have to’ meaning an obligation, the /v/ at the end of the word changes to an /f/. Also&nbsp;the vowel sound in the&nbsp;word ‘to’ changes to a schwa - /ə/. ‘Have to’&nbsp;becomes /h&aelig;ftə/. Here are some more examples.<br /><strong><br />Examples</strong><br />They have to be there by 10.<br />We have to find another flat.<br />You have to tell me the gossip.<br />I always have to take the train.</p>

"<p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Hi, I'm Tim and this is my pronunciation workshop. Here, I'm gonna show you how English is really spoken. It'll help you become a better listener and a more fluent speaker. Come on, let's go inside. Now, when we speak English fluently, the sounds in words can join together, change or even disappear entirely. Sometimes more than one of these can happen. Take this for example. Now, I'm sure you know what it is, but let's ask the people of London:</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>An egg sandwich<br />It's a sandwich<br />It's a sandwich<br />It's an egg sandwich&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Now, the word 'sandwich' has an /n/ followed by a /d/, doesn't it? Or does it? Listen again, what sound can you hear?</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>An egg sandwich<br />It's a sandwich<br />It's a sandwich<br />It's an egg sandwich</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Instead of 'sandwich', we hear 'samwich'. That's pretty crazy, right! So, what is going on? Well, first the /d/ disappears in between two consonants. You might remember this from our video on elision. So 'sandwich' becomes 'sa<strong>n</strong>wich'. Now, we have an /n/ followed by a /w/ and /n/ changes to /m/ before /w/. You might remember this from our video on assimilation. So sandwich becomes sa<strong>m</strong>wich. Have another look – this time in slow motion. Watch the shape of the mouth. Can you see /nd/, or /m/?</p>

"<p><strong>Tim</strong><br />Hi. I'm Tim and this is my pronunciation workshop. Here I'm going to show you how English is really spoken. It'll help you to become a better listener and a more fluent speaker. Are you ready? Come on, follow me. Today, we’re going to talk about one of the most important questions in contemporary Britain. The answer will also help you improve your pronunciation. So, what is this question? Well, it involves one of these, and one of these. Quite simply: do you prefer your potatoes steamed - or boiled? What’s your preference? Well this is what the people of London think.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops</strong><br />I prefer steamed potatoes.<br />I prefer boiled potatoes.<br />I prefer steamed potatoes to boiled potatoes.<br />I prefer boiled potatoes.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br />Well there we have it: the nation has spoken. Our completely scientific survey proves that the country is divided fifty-fifty. But what about pronunciation? Well, one of the things that happens when we speak English fluently is that we don’t always pronounce all the sounds in every word. The words steamed and boiled both end in the sound /d/, don’t they? Or do they? Watch and listen again - can you hear the sound /d/?</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops</strong><br />I prefer steamed potatoes.<br />I prefer boiled potatoes.<br />I prefer steamed potatoes to boiled potatoes.<br />I prefer boiled potatoes.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br />It’s very difficult to say /d/ when it comes in between two other consonants. Your mouth has to do a lot of work. So in many cases the /d/ is not pronounced. '<strong>Boiled potatoes</strong>&nbsp;becomes '<strong>boilpotatoes</strong>'. And '<strong>steamed potatoes</strong>' becomes <strong>steampotatoes</strong>. This is called elision. Here are some more examples.</p>
 <p><strong>Examples</strong><br />My best friend let me borrow his car.<br />Don’t hold back - say what you mean.<br />His bike rolled down the hill without him.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br />Right, so you’ve heard the examples, and now it’s your turn. You know the drill: listen and repeat.</p>
 <p><strong>Examples</strong><br />My best friend let me borrow his car.<br />Don’t hold back - say what you mean.<br />His bike rolled down the hill without him.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br />Well done. Now remember, if you want to learn more about pronunciation, then please visit our website, bbclearningenglish.com. And that is about it from the pronunciation workshop for now. I'll see you soon. Bye bye. Right – now I'd better prepare my own potatoes. Ahhh!! I just peeled my finger! Ewwwsh – doesn't look good…</p>

"<p><strong>Tim</strong><br />Hi, I'm Tim and this is my pronunciation workshop. Here, I'm gonna show you how English is really spoken. It'll help you become a better listener and a more fluent speaker. Come on, let's go inside. Now, one of the things that happens when we speak fluently is that the sounds at the end of a word can change. To demonstrate this, we asked people on the streets of London to identify this Tube station.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops</strong><br />Green Park<br />Green Park<br />Green Park<br />It's Green Park</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br />Now, the word Green ends in the sound /n/, doesn't it? Or does it? Listen again, what sound can you hear?</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops</strong><br />Green Park<br />Green Park<br />Green Park<br />It's Green Park</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br />So, what's happening here? Well, when one word ends in the sound /n/ and the next word begins with a /p/, /b/, /w/ or /m/ sound, then the /n/ from the end of the word changes to an /m/ sound as your mouth gets ready to pronounce the next sound. 'Green Park' becomes 'Greempark'. Watch again - this time in slow motion. Look at the mouth shape. Can you see /n/, or /m/?</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops</strong><br />Green Park<br />Green Park<br />Green Park<br />It's Green Park</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br />Interesting, eh? This is called assimilation. Here are some more examples:</p>
 <p><strong>Examples</strong><br />I own ten pairs of socks.<br />He didn't do it on purpose.<br />I would love to live in Paris.<br />Can you come on Wednesday?</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br />Right, so you've heard the examples and now it's your turn. Are you ready? Listen and repeat.</p>
 <p><strong>Examples</strong><br />I own ten pairs of socks.<br />He didn't do it on purpose.<br />I would love to live in Paris.<br />Can you come on Wednesday?</p>

"<p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Hi, I'm Tim and this is my pronunciation workshop. Here, I'm gonna show you how English is really spoken. It'll help you become a better listener and a more fluent speaker. Come on, let's go inside. When we speak English fluently we sometimes add extra sounds in between the words to help them link together. Now, have a look at my feet. What's wrong with this? Let's ask the people of London:</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>The shoe is on the other foot.<br />The shoe is on the wrong foot.<br />The shoe is on the wrong foot.<br />The shoe is on the wrong foot.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>'Shoe' ends in the sound /u:/ and 'is' begins with the sound /ɪ/. But can you hear another sound linking them together? Have another listen:</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>The shoe is on the other foot.<br />The shoe is on the wrong foot.<br />.he shoe is on the wrong foot.<br />The shoe is on the wrong foot.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>When one word ends in an /u:/ sound and the next begins in a vowel sound we can just about hear another sound in between. This sound is a bit like /w/. So 'The shoe is…' becomes 'The shoe<strong>w</strong>is'. This is called the linking /w/ - but it's important to remember that it's not a full /w/ sound. It happens because the mouth moves from an /u:/ sound to a vowel sound and on the way it passes through the /w/ mouth shape. Here are some more examples:</p>
 <p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>When do I have to be there?<br />I haven't got a clue at all.<br />That glue is really strong.<br />I really can't do it.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>So, you've heard the examples, and now it's your turn. Are you ready? Listen and repeat.</p>
 <p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>When do I have to be there?<br />I haven't got a clue at all.<br />That glue is really strong.<br />I really can't do it.&nbsp;</p>

"<p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Hi, I'm Tim and this is my pronunciation workshop. Here, I'm gonna show you how English is really spoken. It'll help you to become a better listener and a more fluent speaker. You ready? Come on, follow me. Now, there's an idiom in the English language that means that something is really easy. Any idea what it is? Well, here's a clue. Do you know now? Let's ask the people of London:</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>It's a piece of cake<br />It's a piece of cake<br />It's a piece of cake<br />It's a piece of cake</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>A piece of cake – an expression that means that something is really easy to do, as well as meaning – a piece of cake. But listen again to the words 'a' and 'of'. They are actually pronounced the same. What is the sound - and are those words stressed?</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>It's a piece of cake<br />It's a piece of cake<br />It's a piece of cake<br />It's a piece of cake</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>The words 'a' and 'of' are both pronounced as<strong>&nbsp;/ə/</strong>&nbsp;and they're not stressed. This sound<strong>&nbsp;/ə/</strong>&nbsp;is the most common sound in the whole English language. It's so common that it even has its own name – schwa. Now, it can be difficult to hear the schwa because it is never stressed. However, it's a vowel sound that's used in many grammar words like articles and prepositions. Here are some more examples.</p>
 <p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I like&nbsp;<strong>a</strong>&nbsp;cup&nbsp;<strong>of</strong>&nbsp;tea in the morning.<br />Could you get a packet&nbsp;<strong>o</strong>f biscuits?<br />Can you give it<strong>&nbsp;to</strong>&nbsp;me?<br />I had&nbsp;<strong>a</strong>n apple f<strong>or</strong>&nbsp;lunch t<strong>o</strong>day.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>So, you've heard the examples, and now it's your turn. Are you ready to start? Listen and repeat.</p>
 <p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I like&nbsp;<strong>a</strong>&nbsp;cup&nbsp;<strong>o</strong>f tea in the morning.<br />Could you get a packet&nbsp;<strong>o</strong>f biscuits?<br />Can you give it t<strong>o</strong>&nbsp;me?<br />I had&nbsp;<strong>a</strong>n apple f<strong>or</strong>&nbsp;lunch t<strong>o</strong>day.</p>

"<p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Hi, I'm Tim and this is my pronunciation workshop. Here I'm gonna show you how English is really spoken. It'll help you become a better listener and a more fluent speaker. Come on, let's go inside.</p>
 <p>Have you ever seen a ghost? No, of course you haven't, because they don't exist. But have you ever heard a sound that wasn't there? Well, if you've listened to lots of real English, you probably have. We asked the people of London what they think is the most important thing the government should prioritise. This is what they said:</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>I think law and order is important.<br />Yes, I think law and order is important.<br />Law and order is very important.<br />We all think that law and order is important.<br />I think law and order is very important.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Meet my boys. 'Law' and 'order'. Join them together with the word 'and' and you can hear another sound after the word 'law'. Listen out for it.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>I think law and order is important.<br />Yes, I think law and order is important.<br />Law and order is very important.<br />We all think that law and order is important.<br />I think law and order is very important.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>In fluent speech, if a word ends in an /ɔː/ sound, like&nbsp;<strong>law</strong>&nbsp;and the next word begins in an /ə/, you'll often hear a /r/ sound linking them together.<strong>&nbsp;Law-r-and</strong>&nbsp;order.&nbsp;<strong>Law-r-and</strong>&nbsp;order. '<strong>Law-r-and</strong>&nbsp;order' is easier to say than 'law and order'. It flows better.</p>
 <p>And this is called intrusion. Now this is a little bit controversial. It doesn't happen in all accents and some people do say it's not the proper way to speak. But it is something you will hear. Just remember the /r/ sound is not very strong. Here are some other examples:&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Can you draw a circle freehand?<br />My dog hurt its paw on some broken glass.<br />There was a flaw in the argument.<br />I saw a good film last night.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Right, so you've heard the examples, now it's your turn. Are you ready to give it a try? Listen and repeat.</p>
 <p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>Can you draw a circle freehand?<br />My dog hurt its paw on some broken glass.<br />There was a flaw in the argument.<br />I saw a good film last night.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>How did you do? Well done. Now, if you want to read more about this topic, please visit our website bbclearningenglish.com. That's it from the pronunciation workshop for this week. Bye.</p>
 <p>Now, do you want a war or what? Ow!</p>

"<p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Hi, I'm Tim and this is my pronunciation workshop. Here I'm gonna show you how English is really spoken. It'll help you become a better listener and a more fluent speaker. Come on, let's go inside.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Today, we're going to hear a disappearing sound. Or rather, we're not going to hear it. What is the negative form of 'can'? 'Can't', right? And what's the final sound in the word 'can't'? /t/, right? Or is it? How good are you at maths? Can you answer this question? Hmm, tricky. Let's ask the people of London:</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>No, sorry, I can't do it.<br />I can't do it.<br />Sorry, I can't do that.<br />Sorry, I can't do that.<br />No, I can't do that.<br />No sorry, I can't do that.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Well, that is very tricky indeed. I'll give you the answer in a minute. But first, did you notice the /t/ sound at the end of 'can't'? No, I don't think I did either. Let's have another listen.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>No, sorry, I can't do it.<br />I can't do it.<br />Sorry, I can't do that.<br />Sorry, I can't do that.<br />No, I can't do that.<br />No sorry, I can't do that.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>In everyday speech, when a /t/ sound comes in between two consonant sounds, we often don't pronounce it. This is because it makes the words flow together more fluently. It's more difficult to say three consonants together in a row when /t/ is in the middle. Your mouth has to do too much work. 'I can't do it' is more difficult to say than 'I can't do it'. When a sound disappears in between two words, it's called elision. Here are some other examples:</p>
 <p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I can't stand the rain.<br />It must be time to leave<br />Am I the first person here?<br />I don't want it.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>So, you've heard the examples, and now it's your turn. Are you ready to give it a go? Listen and repeat.</p>
 <p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>I can't stand the rain.<br />It must be time to leave<br />Am I the first person here?<br />I don't want it.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>How did you get on? Great. Remember, if you want to read more about this topic please visit our website bbclearningenglish.com. Now, are you still struggling with that maths question? Well, let me put you out of your misery – here's the answer. Right. Well, that's all for this week from the pronunciation workshop. I'll see you next week. Is that the time?! I'm running seriously late. I must go. Bye.</p>
 <p>Ow!</p>

"<p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Hi, I'm Tim and this is my pronunciation workshop. Here I'm gonna show you how English is really spoken. It'll help you become a better listener and a more fluent speaker. Come on, let's go inside.</p>
 <p>Now, do you know my star sign? Of course you don't, I don't even know my star sign. I don't believe in any of that rubbish. But I know someone who does. Say hello to my twin, Tom.</p>
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Hi.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Hi Tom.</p>
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh, hi Tim.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>So, Tom, what's our star sign?</p>
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>I don't know what yours is Tim, but I'm a Gemini.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Thanks Tom, you can go now.</p>
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>You're welcome. Bye.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>You know when I think of Tom, and the fact that I got the brains and the good looks, it makes me feel a bit like this.</p>
 <p>Oh, I've got an idea. I can use this to help with this week's topic. Let's ask the people of London what they think of this photo.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>That man looks sad.<br />He looks sad.<br />He looks sad.<br />He looks sad.<br />He looks sad.<br />He looks sad.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>How many 's' s are there in the words 'he looks sad'. Two, right. But how many can you hear? Watch again.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>That man looks sad.<br />He looks sad.<br />He looks sad.<br />He looks sad.<br />He looks sad.<br />He looks sad.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>When one word ends in a /s/ sound and the next word begins in /s/, we don't pronounce both sounds, nor do we pronounce just one sound. Instead they come together to make a slightly longer 's' sound. So, 'he looks sad' becomes 'he lookssad'. This is called 'twinning' or gemination. It helps the words to flow smoothly from one to the other in everyday speech. Here are some more examples:&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>She's silly.<br />He's sitting over there.<br />Can you come this Saturday?<br />That's so unfair!</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Right, so you've heard some examples, now it's your turn. Are you ready to start? Listen and repeat.</p>
 <p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>She's silly.<br />He's sitting over there.<br />Can you come this Saturday?<br />That's so unfair!</p>

 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>He really is stupid.</p>

"<p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Hi, I'm Tim and this is my pronunciation workshop. Here I'm gonna look at English as it's really spoken. It'll make you a better listener and a more fluent speaker. Come on, let's go inside.</p>
 <p>Today, we're talking about war. War, what is it good for? Well, as it turns out, it can be used to help illustrate a feature of fluent speech. As you can see, we write war with three letters: w-a-r, but when we pronounce it, there are only two sounds: /w/ /ɔː/.</p>
 <p>The 'r' in the spelling is not pronounced in the word itself, or if the next word begins with a consonant sound. But have a listen to this. We went out and asked people in the streets of London to name a famous Russian book. This is what they said:</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>Oh the most famous Russian book I can think of is War and Peace.<br />War and Peace.<br />War and Peace.<br />War and Peace.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Simple, right? Everybody knows War and Peace.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>I've never heard of the book War and Peace.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Well, almost everybody. But have another listen to the way they say it.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops<br /></strong>War and Peace.<br />War and Peace.<br />War and Peace.<br />War and Peace.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>The word after war begins with a vowel sound. And in this case, the 'r' is pronounced. War and Peace, War and Peace. This is called a 'linking r' and it helps to make the words flow together more smoothly in natural speech. Here are some more examples:</p>
 <p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>You know, I really like my mother-in-law.<br />Have you been to the Tower of London?<br />You've got something in your eye.<br />Never again!</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>So, you've heard the examples - now it's your turn. Are you ready to give it a try? Listen and repeat.</p>
 <p><strong>Examples<br /></strong>You know, I really like my mother-in-law.<br />Have you been to the Tower of London?<br />You've got something in your eye.<br />Never again!</p>

"<p><strong>Tim</strong><br />Hi. I'm Tim and this is my Pronunciation workshop. Here I'm going to show you how English is really spoken. It'll help you become a better listener and a more fluent speaker. Come on, let's go inside. Here's a question for you: When is a tea not a tea? Well, this is the answer. What is it? And what colour is it? Let's go to the streets of London to find out.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops</strong><br />It's a white piece of paper.<br />It's a white piece of paper.<br />That is a white piece of paper.<br />That's a white piece of paper.<br />That is a white piece of paper.</p>
 <p><strong>Tim<br /></strong>Now the word 'white' ends in the sound /t/ doesn't it? Or does it? Let's have another listen.</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops</strong><br />It's a white piece of paper.<br />It's a white piece of paper.<br />That is a white piece of paper.<br />That's a white piece of paper.<br />That is a white piece of paper.<br /><strong><br />Tim<br /></strong>In fluent speech, if one word ends in a&nbsp;/t/ sound and the next word begins in a /p/&nbsp;sound, the /t/&nbsp;is pronounced slightly differently. In fact, we pronounce it as if it were almost a /p/&nbsp;sound. So 'white piece of paper' becomes 'whi(te) piece of paper'. Let's take another look, this time in slow motion:</p>
 <p><strong>Voxpops</strong><br />whi(te) piece<br />whi(te) piece<br />whi(te) piece<br />whi(te) piece<br />whi(te) piece of paper</p>
 <p><strong>Tim</strong><br />Interesting, hey? This is an example of how sounds change in everyday speech - and it's called assimilation. Here are some more examples:</p>
 <p><strong>Examples</strong><br />There are lots of grea(t) parks in London.<br />I love spli(t) pea soup.<br />I ha(te) potatoes.<br />My ma(te) picked us up from the airport.</p>
