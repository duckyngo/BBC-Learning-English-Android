"<p>A hidden and largely unknown history is re-emerging. These Nubian pyramids in modern-day Sudan were built around the fourth century BC.</p> 
 <p>They're much smaller than the Egyptian ones, but Sudan boasts nearly double the number.</p> 
 <p>This was one of the main cities in the Kingdom of Kush and the pyramids served as <strong>tombs</strong> for kings and queens. Today, the site is largely deserted.</p> 
 <p>But a new generation is helping to recover this history. And they are making it their own.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mohamed Elmur, Tour Guide</strong><br /> I was surprised to see all of these things that literally nobody visited, that no one is taking care of them. This is an ancient history for our families. And the stories that I've heard from my family about this place - the stories of how these places were led by women, how these places were great <strong>civilisations</strong> back in time. And I wanted to know more, how to take care of it, how to make the world know more about it.</p> 
 <p>Mohammed made it his mission to get the Sudanese youth interested in their country's history. He set up a camp, and began offering free tours on social media, hoping it would help preserve Sudan's ancient <strong>wonders</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mohamed Elmur, Tour Guide<br /> </strong>“This is the pyramid that was blown up by dynamite.”</p> 
 <p>In the 1830s, an Italian <strong>treasure</strong> hunter came here in search of the jewels buried in the pyramids. He blew off the tops… destroying the <strong>centuries-old heritage</strong>.</p> 
 <p>But there's still a lot to see. And young Sudanese are making the journey and braving the desert.</p> 
 <p>“You as a Sudanese, you need to know your history, your culture, you to be proud about it. You have to tell other people about your history - about how big is it. So you have to see it with your own eyes before you tell it to other people.”</p> 
 <p>The pyramids remain largely unguarded, even though this is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p> 
 <p>There's a rich history here to protect… and perhaps even more to discover.</p>"
"<p>The remote mountain forests of Sumatra are home to some of our closest ape relatives. And a small population here, first discovered just 20 years ago, has been hiding a scientific secret.</p> 
 <p>This is the Tapanuli orangutan - a <strong>species</strong> new to science. Until now, it was thought that there were just two distinct <strong>species</strong> of orangutan – Sumatran and Bornean, like this big male here. But this new study shows that there are actually three – a tiny population has been hidden away and isolated by hundreds of thousands of years of evolution.</p> 
 <p>Early <strong>DNA</strong> analysis suggested these animals were peculiar compared to the other Sumatran apes. So scientists embarked on a detailed study examining what they ate and their unique calls.</p> 
 <p>Years of painstaking <strong>genetic comparisons</strong>, enabled scientists to reconstruct the animal's <strong>evolutionary history</strong>. The final piece of the puzzle though, was tiny but consistent differences between the Sumatran, and this, the Tapanuli orangutan skull.</p> 
 <p><strong>Professor Serge Wich, Liverpool John Moores University: <br /> </strong>“It’s an amazing <strong>breakthrough,</strong> I think. There's only seven, if we exclude ourselves, of great ape species. So adding one to that very small list is spectacular.&quot;</p> 
 <p>With just eight hundred individuals, this species will go straight onto the critically endangered list. Logging, mining, and plans for a hydro-electric dam already pose a threat to its habitat. The hope is that adding this ape to the biology textbooks will help to ensure its survival.</p>"
"<p>There’s a <strong>biological clock</strong> keeping time inside all of us. It's the reason we want to sleep at night, but it also drives huge changes in the way our body works including in our heart muscle.</p> 
 <p>This is lifesaving <strong>open-heart surgery</strong>. The operation puts the heart under huge stress and the study in Lille in France suggests the body clock also influences our recovery.</p> 
 <p>The study on five hundred patients showed the risk of <strong>complications,</strong> including heart attacks, halved from 18 percent in morning operations to just nine percent in the afternoon.</p> 
 <p>The researchers said patients should not be frightened away from vital surgery. They want to do more studies, but think <strong>high-risk patients</strong> might benefit from being moved to the afternoon.</p> 
 <p>This study shows the potential of doing <strong>medicine</strong> in time with the body clock and the researchers are now investigating other types of surgery.</p>"
"<p>Imagine having to eat just 40 grams of meat per day. That's roughly the size of a regular burger. A group of researchers say that's what people should aim for in order to reduce pressure on meat production.</p> 
 <p>Researchers say more and more meat products now have bugs that are <strong>resistant</strong> to available <strong>antibiotics </strong>– and that can easily be <strong>transmitted</strong> to people. So, they want the amounts of the drugs used in livestock regulated.</p> 
 <p><strong>Professor Sam Kariuki, Antimicrobial Resistance Expert:</strong> <br /> &quot;A lot of these antibiotics can be done away with, especially their usage for prevention of disease that's <strong>prophylaxis </strong>- and growth promotion, by simply ensuring that the farmer is able to observe… what we call phytosanitary conditions.&quot;</p> 
 <p>John usually doesn't allow visitors into the farm. He also rears chicken of the same age at a time.</p> 
 <p><strong>John Njuguna, chicken farmer:</strong></p> 
 <p>“These sheds also harbour some kind of germs or bacteria. So when the other flock comes out we wash the whole place, we <strong>disinfect</strong>, and then we have a resting period of about 14 days. “</p> 
 <p>That way he’s able to prevent diseases and therefore avoid using antibiotics. But the vast majority of small-scale farmers in developing countries, and larger scale ones in developed countries, tend to overuse the drugs. If that doesn’t change, the available medicine could be rendered ineffective for treatment in the coming years.</p>"
"<p>A shadow in the sea or something more <strong>sinister</strong>?</p> 
 <p>From the beach it's hard to tell but from the skies the drone has a clearer view. It feeds into deep learning software, which it's claimed has a 92% success rate in spotting sharks, as well as less <strong>threatening</strong> species. Every time it sees a dolphin, whale or a swimmer <strong>in distress</strong> it learns their shape. Launched along the beaches of New South Wales, the drones can patrol for 40 minutes. Daniel was one of the first to train as a lifesaver pilot.</p> 
 <p>Daniel Trollope, Drone pilot<br /> I mean, I can't physically run out and grab a board and paddle out and save someone, but sitting on the beach we’ve got eyes in the sky and we're just another layer of protection, really.</p> 
 <p>The drones don’t only observe - they can react too, dropping an inflatable device to help people in the sea. It won't replace the use of controversial shark nets and drum lines however – which some claim <strong>do more harm than good</strong>. The drones won't be on every beach every day, but they should give everyone a better understanding of what’s down below.</p>"
"<p>Reducing the eight million tons of plastic <strong>dumped</strong> in the world's oceans every year is now a priority around the globe and closing the loop by recycling is one answer.</p> 
 <p>These are deposit return-or-reverse vending machines. You put used plastic bottles in and they pay out. It scans the bar code on the label and offers the chance to make a donation to charity or credit in this supermarket.&nbsp; <strong>Collections</strong> are made across Sweden and brought here to this plant 90 minutes south of Stockholm. They handle plastic and glass bottles as well as aluminium cans. The Swedes have been using this type of system since the mid-eighties.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>But the country is no stranger to the scourge of plastic pollution, especially in the sea.&nbsp; It's a major problem here but one the environment minister insists is solvable.</p> 
 <p><strong>Karolina Skog - Swedish Environment Minister</strong></p> 
 <p>“There are many interesting new materials coming up from research and innovation and I see that once we have knowledge on really <strong>sustainable materials</strong> we can enter them into market rather quickly because there is a public demand and we have legal tools to use if needed. So yes, I am optimistic if we work together policy and industry.”</p> 
 <p>And people too. As plastics <strong>break down</strong> to <strong>micro level</strong> and enter the food chain in our oceans, it's not just an issue for coastal communities. It's a problem that affects all of us and can only be solved by all of us.</p>"
"<p>Africa is building a giant wall - of trees. It stretches across the entire continent, in a bid to help fight the effects of climate change. It's called the Great Green Wall - but can it work?</p> 
 <p>The wall spans 11 countries - measuring 8,000 kilometres long and 15 kilometres wide. So far, Senegal has made the best progress by planting 11 million trees.</p> 
 <p>This village chief says the Green Wall is reversing <strong>desertification</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Absaman Moudouba - Village Chief <br /> </strong>When there were no trees, the wind used to dig up and <strong>erode</strong> the soil but it is more protected now. The leaves provide compost and the canopy increases the <strong>humidity</strong> of the environment and offers some shade so there is less need for a lot of watering.</p> 
 <p>The project is planting <strong>drought-resistant</strong> acacia trees. The tree roots hold the water in the soil so formerly dry wells have filled up again.</p> 
 <p><strong>Absaman Moudouba - Village Chief <br /> </strong>Before, there was widespread drought and hunger here.&nbsp; Then the tree planting took place and then a garden for the women to grow crops. Before people used to migrate but nowadays they just follow the line of the Great Green Wall for jobs. They no longer leave.</p> 
 <p>The project, which began in 2007, is expected to cost a total of eight billion dollars. The Green Wall is still years from completion, but the World Bank, the United Nations, the African Union and the UK Botanical Gardens have all pledged money to continue <strong>planting.</strong></p>"
"<p>Behind a fire station in Stockport (UK), some bees are about to <strong>get connected</strong>. An Australian scientist, leading a global bee monitoring project, is fitting them with a <strong>chip</strong> that will allow them to be <strong>tracked</strong>. Now the bees will be counted in and out of the hive.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peter Carter, bee project manager</strong> <br /> &quot;So now we understand more about their behaviour – when they leave the hive, how long they stay away and when they return, who they are travelling with. We are identifying individual insects here which we have not been able to do in the past.&quot;</p> 
 <p>The tech company Cisco has recruited beekeepers across Greater Manchester to take part in the programme. One hope is that the data will give greater understanding of what keeps bees healthy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Alan Towse, bee keeper</strong> <br /> &quot;It's very, very difficult to look inside the hive and know what's happening with an individual bee, so by <strong>tagging</strong> an individual bee you get to know how long it lives.&quot;</p> 
 <p>Over the coming months thousands of them will be at work, not just making honey but providing data which could make Manchester a healthier and <strong>smarter</strong> city.</p>"
"<p>Nothing happens too quickly in the tortoise world but this is <strong>a</strong> <strong>comeback</strong> worth the wait. The Floreana tortoise, once thought wiped out, has been on the extinction list for a century and a half. Now, with careful conservation, the species is being <strong>brought back from the dead</strong>.</p> 
 <p>The species became extinct from its home island of Floreana during the mid-nineteenth century after hunting and exploitation from the first settlers. Some Floreana were dropped on other islands breeding with other tortoises.</p> 
 <p>But now the original species is slowly and steadily <strong>staging its return</strong>. A <strong>breeding programme</strong> at the Galapagos National Park has yielded dozens of Floreana pure-bred tortoises, with hopes of thousands more in the coming years.</p> 
 <p>They'll be given time to grow into their shells within the national park. Then it’s hoped that in five years the Floreana will be <strong>released back into the wild</strong> to reclaim their island. But there's no rush!</p>"

"<p>Previous studies have suggested that around a third of very overweight people are healthy – they have normal blood pressure and cholesterol levels despite being classed as obese, according to their body mass index, which is a measure of height versus weight. But a new analysis of the medical records of 3.5m UK residents suggests the idea of healthy obesity is a <strong>myth</strong>. Compared to those of a normal weight, it suggests even outwardly healthy obese people have a 49% greater risk of developing coronary heart disease.</p>

They estimate that 60% of primate species are now threatened with extinction and 75% have populations that are in decline. Forest habitat that these animals rely on is being destroyed - primarily for agriculture and logging. Reversing these declines means looking closely at where we source products like timber, palm oil and meat. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"<p>Today about one in four babies are born in hospital by caesarean section. Historically, women with very narrow pelvises would have died <strong>in labour</strong> and not pass these genes on to their daughters.
