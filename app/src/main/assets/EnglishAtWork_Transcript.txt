"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to English at Work where the day has finally come – it's Anna and Tom's wedding. All their friends, work colleagues and business acquaintances are there… such as Mr Lime…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>Fantastic Anna, fantastic!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yuk, Slimey Limey, I never liked him.&nbsp; Sorry about the venue Anna – but it's all we could get at short notice.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I think the office at Tip Top Trading is an ideal place for a wedding and besides the…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>Anna! My favourite girl. &nbsp;I got here as fast I could. I thought I was the only man for you but I guess Tom has stolen that title! Your choice Anna, your choice!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh hello Mr Socrates, this is a nice surprise. Come over here and say hello to Tom.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>Hey Tom.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh hello Mr S. Nice to see you. You're not doing any firing today are you? &nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>Of course not Tom. In fact, as a kind of wedding present, I wondered if you wanted a new job? I'm offering you a chance to manage my new office in Paris.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Me?! Manager… in Paris! Well Mr S…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Tom… aren't we about to get married… start a life <span>together</span>?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh yes.. erm, thanks Mr S for you kind offer but I will have to decline. I'm about to spend the rest of my life with this wonderful woman.</p> 
 <p><strong>Registrar<br /></strong>Ladies and gentlemen, please could you take your seats. The marriage&nbsp;ceremony is about to begin.&nbsp;Do you Anna Jane Wijaya...</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>…out the way, give me that paper. Do you Anna Jane Wijaya take Tom Brian Farquhar Darcy <em>…</em> to be your lawfully wedded husband? To have and to hold from this day forward?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Ermm,&nbsp; errr…</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Come on Anna. This is the most important phrase in the whole series!&nbsp; It's 'I do'!<strong> &nbsp;</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh yes, of course… I do.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>And do you, Tom Brian Farquhar Darcy<em>…</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>…it's a deal… I do. Come on Anna, give us a kiss.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh Denise!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Ahh. It looks like Tom has signed the best contract of his career but not without these phrases:</p> 
 <p><em>Thank you for your kind offer but I will have to decline</em></p> 
 <p><em>It's a deal</em></p> 
 <p><em>I do!</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Thanks to everyone for making this a special day. If it wasn't for Tip Top Trading I wouldn't be starting a new life as Mrs Wijaya-Darcy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Wijaya-Darcy? Shouldn't it just be Mrs Darcy?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I'm the boss now Tom at work… <span>and</span> at home!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Congratulations to Anna and Tom. We have a happy ending – let's hope Anna's journey has inspired you to learn English at work.</p> 
 <p><strong>Everyone<br /></strong>Bye!&nbsp;</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to English at Work where things have got rather dramatic.&nbsp; Anna is on her way to the airport to try and catch Tom before he boards his flight to Australia and his new life on the other side of the world. But will she get there in time?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Thanks. Excuse me, do you know where the check in desks for flights to Sydney are?</p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>Yeah, over there luv – desk number 47.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>OK, thanks.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>… yeah, I always fly business class, it's the kind of guy I am… shame you're not available to fly with me but you know…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Tom, Tom!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Anna? How… what… what are you doing here?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Don't go… we need you… I need you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>But I don’t understand… you rejected me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes but… but…</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>But what Anna? What are you going to say? How can you tell him you were wrong and you've changed your mind?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Hmm, I don't know.</p> 
 <p><strong>Passenger 1<br /></strong>Tell him 'I've been doing a lot of thinking'.</p> 
 <p><strong>Passenger 2<br /></strong>Say, 'I didn't realise how much I missed you until you had gone'.</p> 
 <p><strong>Passenger 3<br /></strong>And tell him, 'I've changed my mind, I will marry you!'</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yeah, yeah, I heard all that and that other man who you're always talking to.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Oh right!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I see. Well Tom, will you marry me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Why should I after all you've put me through?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Yeah why should he?<strong> &nbsp;</strong><em>&nbsp;</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Because Tom… you're a funny guy and… I love you and… I can't live without you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Passengers<br /></strong>Ahhh! &nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Let me think about this … oh if you put it like that then yes, I will marry you!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh Tom!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hooray. At last! We got there in the end but not without using these phrases:</p> 
 <p><em>I've been doing a lot of thinking.</em></p> 
 <p><em>I didn't realise how much I missed you until you had gone.</em></p> 
 <p><em>I've changed my mind, I will marry you!</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And…</p> 
 <p><em>I love you and I can't live without you!</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>I won't be needing these anymore.</p>

 <p>What class does Tom claim he always flies in?<br />Business class.</p>
"
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello again. At the offices of Tip Top Trading things are a bit strange after Tom walked… stormed out in a huff after realising that Anna was never going to marry him. So Anna, I suppose you can get on with being the manager now?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes, I suppose so. But something's not right.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well, you've lost a valuable member of your team.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I know, and a good friend too.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well, you're the boss now – it's time to deal with the situation and get down to business. Tell the team you'll be finding a replacement for Tom and you're going to make some changes in the office. You could also say you want to turn the business round and make it really successful.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>OK, thanks. Excuse me everyone, could we gather round for a quick meeting please. Oh, it's just you now Denise.</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right, well, I need to get down to business so I'll be advertising for a replacement for Tom today – in fact Denise, you might be interested in that? And I want to make some changes in the office. I need to turn this business round and … make it the world's leading plastic fruit production company and… I'm… keen to hear… your ideas.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Is everything alright?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Err… I can't stop thinking about Tom. He seemed so upset when he left and… it's not the same without him around. He made me laugh and… I miss his floppy hair.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Anna, it's time to swallow your pride!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Swallow what?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Admit you are wrong – be honest with yourself and follow your heart – go and marry Tom!&nbsp;Although personally, I don't know what you see in him.<em>&nbsp;</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>You're right! Why didn't I see it? Tom is the man for me – I must call him and find out where he is … oh no, his phone's switched off. Where can I find him? &nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Ingle<br /></strong>Hey Anna. You looking for Tom?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes Mr Ingle, I am.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Ingle<br /></strong>I saw him a while ago, in a real rage, getting into a taxi. He told me he'd booked a flight to Australia and was heading for the airport. He said something about being a 'free spirit'.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Struth! Tom really is going too far – to the other end of the world in fact. Does this mean we'll never hear from Tom again? For now, let's remind ourselves of some of the phrases Anna used to deal with a difficult situation:</p> 
 <p><em>I'll be advertising for a replacement for Tom today</em></p> 
 <p><em>I want to make some changes in the office</em></p> 
 <p><em>I need to turn this business round</em></p> 
 <p><em>I'm keen to hear your ideas</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>…but work can wait. I've got to get to the airport quickly before Tom gets on that flight. Taxi! Taxi!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>This is going to be interesting!</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Welcome back to the offices of Tip Top Trading where there's a bit of confusion. Anna…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>I think Tom's got the wrong end of the stick.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>But I didn't give him a stick.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>No, no. I think there's been a misunderstanding. When you said your answer was 'yes' he thought you meant 'yes, I'll marry you'!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh no! I meant yes to the promotion. Gosh I've got to sort this out. Tom, Tom, hold on please.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>We can't hang about Anna. Let's fix a date, invite everyone – even Paul.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>No, no, we can't.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>You're right, not Paul – he just talks about biscuits.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>No. I mean 'no', we can't get married. I meant yes to the promotion. I can't marry you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>What? So when you said 'yes' you meant 'no'?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>I see. Right, that's it. Anna, I've made it very clear what I think about you and you… you… just throw it back in my face. I've had enough… enough of you… enough of this company. I quit!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Anna. I think he's upset. He's having a tantrum.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>A tantrum – is that serious?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Not really. Maybe you need to calm him down and make him change his mind. Tell him 'not to be too hasty', 'don't rush into a decision' and say 'we can work this out' – you can can't you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I think I can. Tom, please, don't be too hasty. Let's talk about this. We can work something out, just don't rush into making a decision – please. You're my best – my only – sales executive.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Sorry Anna – I'm a free spirit. I must go where the wind takes me. You've had your chance, now it’s mine. I’m off.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Wow, I've never seen Tom be such a… man. Will this be the last time we ever see him?</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;Here are some of the phrases Anna used to try and get Tom not to leave:</p> 
 <p><em>Don't be too hasty</em></p> 
 <p><em>Don't rush into making a decision</em></p> 
 <p><em>We can work this out</em></p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello again and welcome back to English at Work – the drama about life at the plastic fruit production company called Tip Top Trading. You may remember Anna, the company's newest and brightest sales executive, was offered a promotion and a marriage proposal at the same time. She's taken time out to think about her reply but everyone in the office really misses her.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>I dunno Denise, I'd be good for Anna, I think we would be been a perfect pair. Mr and Mrs Darcy… it sounds good…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I'm back!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Anna! I…we weren't expecting you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes I can see – perhaps you could tidy up your desk Tom.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Very funny Anna – still trying to be the boss! So did you have a good trip? Did you get some 'head space'?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Eh?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>He means time alone to think about the things you want to think about. Tell him you've been <em>chewing things over</em> – it means you've been thinking about your proposals and say <em>I have come to a final decision</em>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>OK, well it's true; I have done a lot of thinking. Tom, I did have some head space and a chance to… chew things over…</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yes! Yes! And?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>And I've come to a final decision.&nbsp; The answer is 'yes'. I accept. There's no doubt really… I should give it a go… I need the experience… and besides, what's the worst thing that can happen?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh Anna. I'm so happy. You won't regret your decision.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hmm – is Anna really saying 'yes' to Tom's marriage proposal or has there been a misunderstanding?</p> 
 <p>Here are some of the phrases we've heard today:</p> 
 <p><em>I've had a chance to chew things over</em></p>

 <p>What does Anna ask Tom to do?<br />Tidy his desk.</p>
"
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello again and welcome back to the final English at Work. Mr Socrates has sacked Paul from his position as manager of Tip Top Trading and he's offered Anna a promotion – to be the new boss. But will she accept?&nbsp; What's wrong Anna?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I feel bad about replacing Paul. He's been good to me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>It's business Anna. He's just not up to the job – but you are.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Thanks. But why me? Can I do the job? I'm not as experienced as Tom.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>I think we have seen over the year that you definitely have more experience than Tom! Go on Anna, you can do it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Hmmm.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>So Anna… what do you say? Will you replace Paul as the new boss of Tip Top Trading? Come on Anna. This promotion recognises your achievements at the company. It's an opportunity of a lifetime.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I know.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>You'll be my right-hand man.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>I think he means right-hand woman! It means you'd be his most trusted and invaluable assistant.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I see.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Anna, if you need time to think you could say &quot;thank you for your kind words&quot; and, &quot;could I have time to consider your offer?&quot;</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Erm, Mr Socrates. This news has come as a bit of a shock. Thank you for your kind words but please could I have some time to consider your offer?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>Oh… OK Anna. But don't leave it too long. I have a habit of changing my mind.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>OK, Mr Socrates… I mean Brad… I'll call you back soon.&nbsp; Bye.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh… has Mr S offered you Paul's job by any chance?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>And you said you'd think about it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes. I'm not sure if I can take on that much responsibility.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>It's easy peasy. I could do it standing on my head.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>But he's not offering<span>&shy;</span> <span>you</span> the job Tom.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Please don't mention this to Paul… not yet… he's very upset.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>I know nothing!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>You know nothing? About what?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>I mean, I'll remain tight lipped… I won't say a word… until it's all official like. You can count on me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>&quot;You can count on me&quot;!?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Uh?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>&quot;You can count on me&quot;. That was the message with that that bunch of flowers someone sent me. It was you wasn't it?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Well… err… I suppose… yes… it was me Anna. I couldn't help it. I… I… love you Anna.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Do you know what Tom… I quite like you too… I think you're… sweet<em>.</em> Now come on and give me a kiss.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Oh crumbs, shall I come back later?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>No it's ok Paul. We’re just… getting to know each other a bit better. In fact, Anna… I'd like to ask you something.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Oh, why is Tom getting down on one knee?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>I expect he's dropped one of his contact lenses.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>No it's not that. Anna, I'd like to ask you something… err… will you… will you marry me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>What?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Crikey, what a dilemma. Now Anna's got two important questions to answer. Will she take the job as Tip Top Trading's newest and youngest manager? And will she marry Tom?&nbsp; Here's a reminder of what Mr Socrates had to say about her:</p> 
 <p><em>This promotion recognises your achievements at the company.&nbsp; </em></p> 
 <p><em>It's an opportunity of a lifetime.</em></p> 
 <p><em>You would be my right-hand man.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And if Anna accepts the job, here's what she could say:</p> 
 <p><em>I'd be delighted to accept. Thank you. </em></p> 
 <p><em>When would I start? </em></p> 
 <p><em>Could we discuss the terms and conditions of the new job?</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Let's find out what Anna has to say.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh Tom, I don't know what to say. It's come as a bit of a shock. Can I have some time to think about it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>I suppose.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Well, while you think about that, I've got some good news. I've been offered a new job.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>That's fantastic news Paul. What is it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>It's to be Head Taster at a company called Better Biscuits.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>That's fantastic news Paul.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yeah, well done Paul. That's right up your street.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>So Anna, does that mean you'll do Paul’s job now?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Don't answer that. Answer my proposal first.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>No, I think she should sort out her work first.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>But I've been waiting to ask her for months.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>I think it's up to Anna to say what she wants.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Quiet! Look everyone, I can't decide what to say to you Tom, or Mr Socrates. So I've decided I'm going to take a short holiday to have some time to think.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Good idea. Where shall we go?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>On my own Tom. When I return I will give you my answers.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Crumbs. I think I'd better get a biscuit.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>A good idea Anna. But we’re going to have to wait a while to find out what she decides. She needs a rest after learning so much during her year at Tip Top Trading. We hope you've enjoyed learning with her and now feel more confident in using English at work! That’s all from me and the team at Tip Top Trading for now.&nbsp; Until we meet again, bye!</p>

"
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello again and welcome back to English at Work. Last time we heard the team from Tip Top Trading having a <em>smashing</em> time at the launch of its plastic aubergine. Tom threw one at Dave from the IT department, but it missed him and went through a window!&nbsp; It's time for Paul to hand out some harsh words.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>That behaviour just isn't on.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Sorry Paul… but it was quite funny wasn't it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>No it wasn't.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Sorry Paul, Tom was just angry with Dave. I thought he liked me but we saw him with Julie from accounts.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Really? He seemed such a decent chap… anyway, don't do it again. OK? In the meantime, you're going to have to pay for that broken window.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>What… hey? Bbbut…</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Now, excuse me, I need to take this. Hello, Paul Smith speaking. Ah, Mr Socrates… yes… ah, you've heard…</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Crikey, come on we'd better go.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>That was a good shot Tom! Looks like it's made an impact on Dave. Look, he's sent Anna some flowers.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh there's a note on it. It says &quot;You can count on me&quot; but no name.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>That is a strange thing for him to write.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Hmm, it is and it's not his handwriting.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Maybe a secret admirer eh? I wonder who it could be?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Are you OK Paul? You look as white as a sheet.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>I'm not actually. Mr Socrates says he's having a <em>strategic review</em>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>A what?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>He means he's been looking at how the business is operating and how it should operate in the future.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>That sounds serious.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>And as part of his review, he says he wants to <em>downsize</em> and he's asked me to… <em>step aside</em>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Why? What are you in the way of?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>No Anna. To <em>step aside</em> is a polite way of saying to leave your position in the company.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh. I don't understand Paul. Why?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>He says <em>the company needs new direction and more dynamic leadership</em>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Crumbs Paul, you can't get more dynamic than you!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Tom! But Paul, you've been a great boss.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Thanks Anna. I guess it's the economic climate, we're not making enough money so cutting staff is inevitable.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yeah but you cut Denise's job.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Yes but we had to get her back because she was necessary for the smooth running of the department.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>That's right.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>But Mr Socrates says I'm '<em>surplus to requirement</em>'.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh, that doesn't sound good… does it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>If Paul's job is '<em>surplus to requirement</em>', it means his input to the business is no longer needed. So it's not good news.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Anyway Anna, Mr Socrates wants to know if you got his special message?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Special message? The flowers!?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>That's strange. Why is Mr Socrates sending you flowers?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>It is a bit strange. Anyway, Paul's news has come as a shock for everyone. Here are some of the phrases Mr Socrates used to break the bad news:</p> 
 <p><em>I've been doing a strategic review of the company.</em></p> 
 <p><em>I need to downsize.</em></p> 
 <p><em>I need you to step aside.</em></p> 
 <p><em>The company needs a new direction and more dynamic leadership.</em></p> 
 <p><em>You are surplus to requirement.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Right, I'm going to have to call Mr Socrates and find out why he's sent me flowers.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>Socrates… who wants me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Erm… hello Mr Socrates… it's Anna here.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>Anna! My favourite girl. Please call me Brad. So glad you called.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I needed to speak to you about the flowers you sent me. I'm very flattered but I don't think…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>The flowers?! Sorry honey, I haven't sent you any flowers but I have sent you an email – have you read it yet?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>No. What did it say?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>I was saying that as I'm giving Paul the chop, would you like a promotion?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>A promotion?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>Yes. You have been an outstanding member of the team so how would you like to be the new manager of Tip Top Trading's London office?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>What a fantastic opportunity and one that Anna surely can't refuse – or can she? And who did send Anna those flowers with a message saying &quot;You can count on me&quot;? Find out what her answer is in the next English at Work. Bye.</p> 
 <h3>Listening challenge - answer</h3> 
 <p>Who do you think sent Anna the flowers?<br />A secret admirer, so we don't know yet!</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Welcome back to English at Work. It's an exciting day for Tip Top Trading. It's launching its latest product – the plastic aubergine. The launch is taking place at a swanky hotel; lots of clients have turned up - but there's one important person missing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Has anyone seen Anna?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>I haven't seen her all morning. Tom, you were with her last.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>That was last night at the pub. She was drowning her sorrows.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Drowning her sorrows?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yeah. She saw Dave from IT with another woman – Julie from accounts, actually. She was very upset.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Oh poor Anna.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>So you left her drowning in the pub? And who's got the prototype aubergine to show at the launch?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh no! Anna has. It's in her bag. What are we going to do?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Panic!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>No Denise. Calm down. I'll just have to make a start and I'm sure Anna will turn up. OK, here goes. Excuse me everyone, could you all gather round? Our presentation is about to begin.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>I'll change the slides for you on the computer Paul. I'm good with technology.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Okey dokey. Ermm…ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming to our presentation. We have something very exciting to…ermm…show you and it's not a fruit…ha ha…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>…and here it is – fresh from the factory – our plastic aubergine!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Anna, you're just in time.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I know. I think I drank a bit too much last night and now I can't remember what to say.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well, you need to convince everyone that this is best product on the market and that it's something they really want. You could say &quot;We believe this high quality product is something your business needs&quot; – and, &quot;Our new product has been designed to the highest specifications&quot; – and tell people that &quot;This product is the perfect decoration on any caf&eacute; or restaurant table&quot; – tell them that, and the orders will come flying in!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>What? They'll send them by aeroplane?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>No Anna! Just do your presentation and see what happens.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>OK then. Yes everyone, this aubergine may look good enough to eat but it is made of the highest quality plastic and I'm convinced it's something your business needs.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Err yes, that's right. It may be plastic but it is… fantastic!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Thank you Paul. This product has been designed to the highest specifications. It's tough and durable.</p> 
 <p><strong>Client<br /></strong>Yeah but why would I want to buy it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>'Cos it's cheap mate!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>No Tom. It's because it is the perfect decoration on any caf&eacute; or restaurant table. It shows you're serious about food.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>And it doesn't go mouldy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes. We're taking orders today and… and…</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And? And what, Anna?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I don't know what to say next.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Offer them a discount and a guarantee.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh right. If you place an order for more than 1,000, we can offer you a generous discount. Plus, all our products come with a money-back guarantee.</p> 
 <p><strong>Client<br /></strong>I like it!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well done Anna. She gave a clear presentation, and sounded enthusiastic about the product. Here's a reminder of some of the things she said:</p> 
 <p><em>It is made of the highest quality plastic and I'm convinced it’s something your business needs.</em></p> 
 <p><em>This product has been designed to the highest specifications. It's tough and durable.</em></p> 
 <p><em>It is the perfect decoration on any caf&eacute; or restaurant table.</em></p> 
 <p><em>We can offer you a generous discount. Plus, all our products come with a money-back guarantee.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Thanks for listening. Tom has a few slides to show, which illustrate how the aubergine has been designed. Tom… Tom?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh no, it's frozen, the slides won't change.</p> 
 <p><strong>Dave<br /></strong>It's OK, I can fix it, I am the IT guy after all.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Dave? What are you doing here? Cheating on Anna like that. Here Anna, give me that aubergine.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Tom, no!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>There, that's for upsetting Anna.</p> 
 <p><strong>Dave<br /></strong>Ha ha - missed me!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Ha! Well the aubergine's certainly tough and durable.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Tom, Anna, I think we'd better talk about this back in my office.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Crikey! That was certainly a spectacular presentation. Let's hope Tom’s outburst doesn't stop the orders flying in – but not via the window! Find out next time on English at Work. Bye!&nbsp;</p> 
 <h3>Listening challenge - answer</h3> 
 <p>In her presentation, what does Anna suggest using the plastic aubergine for?<br />As a perfect decoration on tables in caf&eacute;s and restaurants.</p>
"
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>It's that time again for English at Work. Life in the offices of Tip Top Trading is still hectic. There's so much to do and tomorrow the team is launching its new product – the plastic aubergine – so everyone needs to pull their weight and get things done – quickly. The problem is, some people are a bit slow at being quick!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Could someone answer that please? I'm on the other line.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Well I can't, I'm already on the phone.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yeah, talking to your friend Marge. And I'm busy… errr… writing a business proposal.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Could someone just answer that phone… oh, you're all busy. I suppose I'd better do it.&nbsp;Hello? Yes? Really! I'm sorry about that. We'll send someone round right away. Yes, this morning. Bye. Anna, are you free to talk in my office now?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes Paul. What's wrong?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Hold on – I just need a quick bite on a biscuit – that's better. Now, that was Nice'n'Cheesy. They're not happy about how slowly we are processing their order. They need our plastic grapes for an exhibition they're doing at the weekend.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>But I thought Tom had sorted that out?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Clearly not. I need you to pull out all the stops and sort this out.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Pull out what stops?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>I mean do all you can to get this order completed, please.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>But we've got the aubergine launch tomorrow.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Leave that to me and Denise to organise. It'll be in… safe hands.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hmm, I'm not so sure about that. Anyway Anna, your priority now is the order for Nice'n'Cheesy. You're going to have to tell the team &quot;We have an order we need to process urgently&quot;, and &quot;We need to pull out all the stops to get this sorted&quot;. You could also say &quot;This is our number one priority&quot; and then delegate tasks to the team to help you get the order sorted. Good luck!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh thanks. Tom, I need your help. It's the order for Nice'n'Cheesy, we need to process it urgently.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>The order? I sent that out ages ago, with the paperwork.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>You mean this paperwork Tom, on your desk?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh no! I must have forgotten. I've had so much to do.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Well, they're not happy, so we've got to pull out all the stops and get them their grapes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>OK but what about the aubergines?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Forget about the aubergines. We've got to get onto this now. It's our number one priority. You go and get the plastic grapes from the warehouse, I'll sort out this paperwork, and I'll meet you downstairs in 15 minutes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Why, where are we going?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>We're getting a taxi to the offices of Nice'n'Cheesy so we can hand deliver the grapes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh right, but isn't it nearly lunchtime?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>There's no time for lunch, Tom. We need to do this now!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Oh Anna, you're amazing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>She certainly is! Anna has wasted no time in sorting out this problem and that's important if you want to keep your business going. Here's a reminder of some of the phrases Anna used:</p> 
 <p><em>We've got to pull out all the stops.</em></p> 
 <p><em>We have an order we need to process urgently.</em></p> 
 <p><em>We need to pull out all the stops to get this sorted.</em></p> 
 <p><em>This is our number one priority.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Tom and Anna have made it to the offices of Nice'n'Cheesy. Let's find out how they're getting on.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>…so we're really sorry…</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yeah, really sorry…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>…about the delay, and it won't happen again. And we hope you're pleased with the grapes…</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>…and the price!</p> 
 <p><strong>Jane<br /></strong>Yes, the price is very competitive and if you can guarantee a bit more 'customer care', then I'm sure we'll be buying from you again.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes, of course. Thanks very much and sorry again. We hope to see you again soon. Bye!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yeah, yeah, see you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Phew, well done Anna. I think you saved the day once again. Hey, hold on, isn't that your boyfriend, Dave from IT, over there?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>It is. But who's he with?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>You mean, who's he holding hands with? It's Julie from accounts!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>No, it can't be… It is! What's Dave doing with another woman?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>I dunno – but I never trusted him. Come on Anna, you need a drink – a big one.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Oh dear. Poor Anna, it looks like Dave's been cheating on her, but she needs to keep a clear head for the big launch of the plastic aubergine tomorrow. Will she be led by her head - or her heart? Find out next time on English at Work. Bye!</p>

 <p>What has Anna made her number one priority?<br />To get the grapes to Nice'n'Cheesy.</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello again and welcome to English at Work. The team at Tip Top Trading has lots to do, but now Anna has discovered she has to organise a launch party for the new plastic aubergine. It’s taking place at the end of the week and nobody has organised a venue yet! I think Anna is going to need some help. <strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>So Anna, I’m sorry Tom didn't tell you but do you think you can turn something round by Friday?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I'll try, but what do I need to do?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Oh not much, book a room somewhere, send out some invites… arrange some food… and drink… that sort of thing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>That's all?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>You can do it - you're great at this kind of thing. And get the team to help.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Well, I'll give it a go. See you later.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Thanks Anna. And don't forget to order some of those posh Belgian chocolate biscuits, they always go down well with the clients.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Oh dear Anna. It looks like you have your work cut out.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Cut out?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>I mean, you have a difficult job to do - but as Paul says, you can do it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Thanks.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Are you OK Anna? You look a bit worried.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I am. You forgot to tell me about the product launch on Friday and now Paul wants me to organise it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Did I? Oh sorry. Look, if I can help in any way, just let me know.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Well, you could book a venue for the launch.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Ahh yeah… just remembered, I've got some Imperial Lemons I need to send out. Maybe later, yeah?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>How am I going to find a venue for the launch at such short notice?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>You need to ask for recommendations, search on the internet, or look in the phone directory, and then make a call. You need to say &quot;Could I check availability for your venue please?&quot;, then ask &quot;What business facilities do you have?&quot; and &quot;How many people can the room or venue hold?&quot; You could ask &quot;Can you provide hospitality?&quot; – that’s things like food and drink. Finally, don't forget to ask &quot;How much does it cost?&quot;</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Thanks, there's a lot to ask. Hi Denise, I've got to book a venue for our plastic aubergine launch. Have you any ideas?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Well, my friend Marge works for a hotel company that has conference facilities. You could give her a call. Look, here's her number.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh, thanks Denise. Let's give it a try… 0–2–0–7–5–6–9–2.</p> 
 <p><strong>Marge<br /></strong>Hello, the Pitz Hotel. Margery speaking.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh hi, this is Anna from Tip Top Trading, I'm a friend of Denise's.</p> 
 <p><strong>Marge<br /></strong>Oh hi Anna. I've heard all about you. What are you ringing for?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I need to check availability for your venue for a product launch we’re doing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Marge<br /></strong>Right! Well, I'm sure I can help. We do have a conference room. When is it for?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>This Friday.</p> 
 <p><strong>Marge<br /></strong>Friday! This Friday? Well… that's a bit tricky: the room is being decorated at the moment.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh.</p> 
 <p><strong>Marge<br /></strong>But we do have a smaller room that you could use – it's got a lovely view of the car park.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I see… and how many people does it hold?</p> 
 <p><strong>Marge<br /></strong>You could easily squeeze in about 20 people.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>20 people. I guess it will have to do. Do you have any business facilities – somewhere to plug in the laptop, projector, wi-fi, that sort of thing?</p> 
 <p><strong>Marge<br /></strong>Oh yes, yes, we're very hi-tech. We even have a fax machine!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>And can you provide hospitality too?</p> 
 <p><strong>Marge<br /></strong>Of course! We do a 'business platter' consisting of orange juice, sandwiches, canap&eacute;s – that really means cheese and pineapple on sticks.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I wonder, can you also provide Belgian chocolate biscuits?</p> 
 <p><strong>Marge<br /></strong>I'm sure we can.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>That's great! OK… and most importantly, how much does it cost?</p> 
 <p><strong>Marge<br /></strong>Well, to book the room for 2 hours usually costs &pound;1,000. The hospitality is extra but as you're a friend of Denise, I'll throw it in for nothing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>You'll throw the food and drink in?! Won't that get messy?</p> 
 <p><strong>Marge<br /></strong>No - I mean we'll provide it for free. Just don't tell anyone, otherwise everyone will expect it!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Well, that's fantastic Marge. Thanks. If you can send us an invoice, we'll sort payment out as soon as possible.</p> 
 <p><strong>Marge<br /></strong>Bye Anna, and tell Denise I'll see her for our Zumba class tomorrow.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Anna has saved the day again. The launch party for the plastic aubergine can now go ahead. If you're trying to book a venue for a business meeting or product launch, here are some of the phrases you could use:</p> 
 <p><em>Could I check availability for your venue please?</em></p> 
 <p><em>What business facilities do you have?</em></p> 
 <p><em>How many people can the room or venue hold?</em></p> 
 <p><em>Can you provide hospitality?</em></p> 
 <p><em>How much does it cost? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>So Anna, was Marge any help?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes. She found me a room and gave me a good deal. We just need to invite our clients now.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>I can do that. I think it’s best if I call them - there's no time to post out invitations.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Good idea.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>But I just need to give Marge a call first, just to check a few things.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Typical Denise. Nothing's more urgent than talking to Marge!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>He can talk! If you need something doing it seems like Anna is the woman you need. Find out what else she is capable of in the next episode of English at Work. Bye!</p>

 <p>What does the room that Marge offers Anna have a view of?<br />The car park.</p>
"
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Welcome back to English at Work. At the offices of Tip Top Trading, things are a bit… tricky. Denise has been reinstated at the company but now wants to do more than just ordering pens. Tom has other ideas and Anna is just caught in the middle. Who can she turn to? Paul maybe… or maybe not?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>So Denise, let's get this straight. You don't want to order the pens anymore, right? &nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Well, I did say if I came back, I wanted to have a go at doing sales.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Err, yes, you did. That's right.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yeah but we got Denise back because we didn't have anyone to order our pens and stuff. That's her main job.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Err yes, absolutely. I see your point.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Excuse me Paul, could I suggest we all take it in turns to order things like pens and paper… share the responsibility?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>That's a good idea Anna.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yeah but…</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>No buts Tom, that's a good solution. Well done Anna… could you draw up a rota so we know who's going to be ordering the pens and when? And don't forget to order biscuits too! Phew, I'm glad I got that sorted out. Right, back to work everyone.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>I can't believe <span>I've</span> got to order pens, it's Denise's responsibility… err, are you OK Anna?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>No I'm not. I can't draw up a rota, not now. I've got too much to do.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Alright don't panic Anna. Just do what I do.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>What's that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Nothing! Just do what you can do and then pretend you've forgotten about the other stuff. Easy!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Oh dear, Tom's not that professional is he? Not like you Anna. You just need to get organised and prioritise.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I need to prioritise?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Yes. Decide what tasks need doing first and maybe delegate some tasks to others. You could say to people &quot;I've got to prioritise. This is the most important so I'm going to concentrate on this first.&quot;, then you could say to someone &quot;It would be a great help if you could take on this other task&quot;. You could also say &quot;I'll have to put off some tasks until tomorrow&quot;. And if you still feel under pressure, say to your boss &quot;I need help, I have too much to do&quot;. &nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Thanks, good advice. I'm just writing a list of all the things I need to do on my new mini me-pad.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Writing a list is a good place to start. Good luck!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>There, that's my list finished. Ah, Denise, sorry to bother you, but you know that rota I was talking about?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>The one for ordering pens?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>That's it. Well, I'm so busy, I was wondering… it would be a great help… if you could make a start on this? Please?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Of course Anna. As it's you. If it was Tom asking, I would have said no!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>What's that Denise? Hey Anna, what are we going to do about the designs for that plastic aubergine?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Gosh, our new aubergine. Hmm, I'm going to have to put that off until tomorrow I'm afraid.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh right. Why, have you got something more important for us to do together, eh?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>No Tom. I've just got to prioritise. This new order from Nice'n'Cheesy is the most important, so I'm going to concentrate on that first. OK?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh right, yeah sure. Me and you will have to wait until tomorrow! So… so… how's it going with Dave from Computer Support?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Very well thanks Tom. Last night he took me somewhere I've never been to before.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Really. Nice.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes, a discount computer shop – he bought me a mini me-pad<em>.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh. Just a 'mini' one hey.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Now, if you could take more interest in our Nice'n'Cheesy contract than you do in Dave, it would be a great help.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh yeah, sure, of course<em>… </em>nice'n'sleazy, that's a good name for Dave!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Idiot! Getting organised is important when you have a lot to do. Tell people what you're doing and don't forget to ask for help. Here's a reminder of what Anna said:</p> 
 <p><em>I've got to prioritise. This task is the most important so I'm going to concentrate on this first.</em></p> 
 <p><em>It would be a great help if you could do this for me please.</em></p> 
 <p><em>I'm going to have to put that off until tomorrow I'm afraid</em>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And don't forget, when you simply have too much to do, tell your boss!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Hello Paul, sorry to bother you. I'm a bit worried… I just have too much to do and need some help.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Yes of course. I don't want you feeling stressed. Let me think… erm... I know, why don't I do the pen rota?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>It's OK, Denise has offered to do that.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Phew, I mean super! Erm… hmm… well, maybe Tom could help you with the launch party?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Launch party? What launch party?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Didn't Tom tell you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>No, he didn't.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>We're launching the plastic aubergine on Friday.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh no!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Keep calm Anna! We're here to help – although organising a launch party in a week is quite a challenge. Find out how it goes on the next English at Work. Bye!</p>

 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br /></span></strong>Anna, if you 'show someone the ropes' it means you explain to someone how to do the job. You'll be great at that.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br /></span></strong>Oh I see. Well I might know what to do but I'm no good at explaining it to someone else.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br /></span></strong>Well the best way is to start at the beginning. Why not suggest to her to 'watch what I do', or give her some of your tasks and say 'please could you make a start on these?' and then reassure her by saying 'I'm here to help so please ask me if you need to know what to do.' Good luck.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br /></span></strong>Thanks! So Denise, it's nice to have you back, how's your new desk?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br /></span></strong>Much bigger than my old one – and look, it goes up….and down.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br /></span></strong>Yes it does.&nbsp; OK, shall we make a start then and I'll show you the ropes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br /></span></strong>Oh yes Anna, of course Anna. Do I need to use the phone?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br /></span></strong>I reckon you're quite experienced with the phone already Denise!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br /></span></strong>Thank you Tom. We won't make any calls yet, just watch what I do for a while.&nbsp; Look, I'm just checking our database so see who we haven't called for a while.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br /></span></strong>Oh yes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br /></span></strong>I'm just checking the dates here…in fact Denise, why don't you make a start on this.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br /></span></strong>Of course…oh look, my phone's ringing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br /></span></strong>Are you going to answer it then?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br /></span></strong>Oh right. Hello, Tip Top Trading, Denise speaking…oh hello Marge! <em>(To Anna)</em> It's Marge, Anna!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br /></span></strong>Oh right. I'll leave you to it – I'm here to help, so please ask me if you need to know what to do.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br /></span></strong>OK Anna, I won't be long. So Marge, how did it go the other night? Really? Really! Well, I'm sitting at my new desk…</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br /></span></strong>Nice to have her back hey?! Some Sales Exec she's going to be!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br /></span></strong>Everyone has to start somewhere Tom! Now Anna is helping – or coaching - Denise I'm sure she'll become an excellent worker. Here are some of the phrases Anna used to help her:</p> 
 <p><em>Let me show you the ropes.</em></p> 
 <p><em>Watch what I do for a while.</em></p> 
 <p><em>Why don't you make a start on this?</em></p> 
 <p><em>I'm here to help, so please ask me if you need to know what to do.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br /></span></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Let's find out how Denise is getting on.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br /></span></strong>So I said to him, it's just not my colour…yes exactly…hold on Marge, everyone's looking at me. I'd better call you back. Yes, tonight. Bye!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br /></span></strong>Hmm, you've certainly got a good phone manner. Do you think you could order some pens now, we've run out.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br /></span></strong>That's not my responsibility anymore.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br /></span></strong>Err, I think it is.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br /></span></strong>Isn't!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br /></span></strong>Is.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br /></span></strong>Isn't!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br /></span></strong>You two, please!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br /></span></strong>Well, she's got time for personal calls but not to order pens.&nbsp;Oh hold on….Oh Hi Jim, how's things? Yeah! Did you catch the match last night? What a goal!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br /></span></strong>Really!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br /></span></strong>Oh dear Anna. Things aren't going well. It's time to sort things out again but what are you going to do? Join us again next time to find out. Bye!</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Welcome back to the chaotic offices of Tip Top Trading. Now Denise has left the company, the place is a mess and important phone messages are being lost.&nbsp; What can be done to make things better?&nbsp; I think we know the answer!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>Hi. Did anyone take a message for me while I was out?&nbsp; I'm expecting an important call.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>Err… no!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>Actually yes Paul. I wrote it on Tom's hand but he washed it off.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>Look, good hygiene's very important to me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>Hmm. That's not very good is it? What's wrong with writing on a piece of paper?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>We've run out of paper… and pens.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>Everything really. Nobody's ordered any stationery or tidied up the office.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>It's since Denise left.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>Yes, maybe I was a bit hasty getting rid of her. It was really just to save money.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>Yeah, but look, if we can't take messages from possible clients we're going to lose even more money.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>Yes… I suppose you have a point. Maybe I will to have reinstate her.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>You mean, get her back?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><strong><br /></strong>Yes Anna, he does. Another way of saying reinstate is he's got to 'reverse his decision'. It means Paul has got to make an awkward call to Denise.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>Look Paul, you're going to have to call her and tell her you've made an error… a huge one actually.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>It wasn't that huge? Actually… Anna, you're her good friend, would you like to call her?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>Me?! B-b-but I can't.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><strong><br /></strong>What a coward! I think it's time to stand your ground Anna. Tell him &quot;You're the boss, I think it's better coming from you&quot;, and remind him &quot;it was your decision so you need to explain the situation&quot;, and remind him &quot;this is your responsibility&quot;. You could suggest he says &quot;I'm sorry, I made a mistake and we would love to have you back.&quot;</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>OK. Do you know what Paul, I think the news is better coming from you… just to make it official.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>Yeah Paul, you are the boss after all.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>And it was your decision in the first place so you need to explain that the situation has changed.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>Well, maybe you're right but I can't tell her I'm wrong can I?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>Look, just say you're sorry. Tell her you made a mistake and I would love to have you back… we all would.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong>Yes, you're right. I should do it. I'll just have a quick biscuit. Here goes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong><strong><br /></strong>Hello?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>Ah... h-h-h-ello Denise. It's me… Paul…your boss… your ex-boss from Tip Top Trading.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong><strong><br /></strong>Oh.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>How are you… getting on?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong><strong><br /></strong>Well…</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>Good, good. Actually, I've been rethinking our staffing situation in the office…</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong><strong><br /></strong>Yes?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>And…well… I'm sorry Denise… I… miscalculated my staffing numbers.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong><strong><br /></strong>You mean you made a mistake?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>Well, I suppose so. So... I would love to have you back in the office as soon as possible. What do you say?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong><strong><br /></strong>Hmm, let me think about it… hmmm… errr… well… hmmm…</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>What will Denise decide? It was a hard phone call for Paul to make, but not one Anna should have made as it wasn't her mistake. She stood her ground with Paul and used the following phrases:</p> 
 <p><em>You're the boss and I think the news is better coming from you.</em></p> 
 <p><em>It was your decision in the first place so you need to explain that the situation has changed.</em></p> 
 <p><em>This is your responsibility.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><strong><br /></strong>And here is a reminder of the phrases Paul used to try and apologise:</p> 
 <p><em>I've been rethinking our staffing situation in the office.</em></p> 
 <p><em>Sorry, I made a mistake. I miscalculated my staffing numbers.</em></p> 
 <p><em>I would love to have you back in the office.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong><strong><br /></strong>Hmmm… well… OK then. I'll start back tomorrow.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>Oh wonderful. I'm so pleased. We'll get your old chair back in position.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong><strong><br /></strong>Actually Paul, if you want me back I'll need a new chair… and a new phone…</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>OK Denise! See you tomorrow.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong><strong><br /></strong>And a pay rise!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>So, is she coming back then?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>Yes, first thing tomorrow.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>That's good because we've just had a call from Nice'n'Cheesy – they said nobody returned their call yesterday and that if we don't contact them by the end of tomorrow they will go elsewhere for their plastic grapes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>Right, we must act… and act fast.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><strong><br /></strong>Let's hope they don't lose that contract. At least with Denise returning to work, things will be a little more organised but for how long? Join us again next time on English at Work. Bye!</p>

"<p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Has anyone seen the stapler?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>I can't find any pens.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>Oh, here it is.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>Will someone answer that phone?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><strong><br /></strong>Hello again and welcome back to English at Work. The offices of Tip Top Trading have become chaotic since Denise left and just at a time when things are getting busy. How is everyone going to cope? Let's find out.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>Hello. Yes? It is. We're very busy at the moment so call back later. Bye.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>That was a bit rude Tom.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>Well we're too busy to be nice.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><strong><br /></strong>Hmm. Not a good attitude Tom. Even when you are busy at work it's important to be polite on the phone. It could be a potential customer. Anna, I think you're going to have to remind Tom about this.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>Yes, I think so.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><strong><br /></strong>If things are busy in the office you could say to someone on the phone 'we're a bit busy at the moment, could I take your name and number and we'll call you back'? And, 'when would be a convenient time to call you?' or if the caller wants to speak to someone specific you could say 'could I take a message please and I'll make sure he or she calls you back?'</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>That's useful. Oh there goes the phone again.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>Anna, could you get that please? I've got a mouthful of biscuit. Thanks.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>Sure Paul.&nbsp; Hello? Tip Top Trading… yes, that's right… but things are a bit busy at the moment. Could I take your name and number and I'll call you back as soon as I can… oh hold on, has anyone got a pen?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>I think we've run out. Denise usually orders them. Here, use my souvenir pen I bought in Italy, you see it changes colour if you hold it up to the light.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>Thanks. Oh no! There's no paper to write it on.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>Here, write it on my hand.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>OK. Hold still. 7-4-9-0-5-6-8. Thanks for your patience, when is a good time to call you back? … OK… 3 o'clock… I'll call you then. Goodbye.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>Sounds important.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>Possibly. Oh not again!&nbsp; Hello, Tip Top Trading, Anna speaking… I see… Well he doesn't seem to be here at the moment… can I take a message and I'll get him to call you back? Tom, I need your other hand to write on… keep still. OK, what's the message? … Yes, call Bob about the lemons on 8-0-9-5-2-4. OK, I'll pass that on. Thanks. Bye.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>Goodness. It's been crazy here since Denise left. Look we've even run out of teabags. I'll go and get some, shall I?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>Hold on Tom. Has that invoice for Tutti Fruity been sent out yet?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>I dunno. Denise usually sends out the paperwork.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>I wish Denise was here!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><strong><br /></strong>So do we all!&nbsp; It sounds like chaos in the office but however hectic things can get, remember to remain professional when answering the phone. Here's a reminder of some of the phrases you could use…</p> 
 <p><em>We're a bit busy at the moment; could I take your name and number and we'll call you back?</em></p> 
 <p><em>When would be a convenient time to call you?</em></p> 
 <p><em>Could I take a message please and I'll make sure he or she calls you back?</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>Ah there you are, Tom, you've been a long time. I need to give Paul that important message I wrote on your hand.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>Ah… yes… it's a bit tricky. You see, I went to the toilet and then I… washed my hands.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>Oh no, you've washed the messages off! What are we going to do now?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>Erm… I'll get that, shall I?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>We can't carry on like this.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><strong><br /></strong>No you can't! Has Anna lost the numbers of two potential clients? Can the company carry on like this? It certainly looks like it could do with another pair of hands.&nbsp; What will happen next? Join us again next time for English at Work. Bye!</p>

"
"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello again. It's a difficult day at the offices of Tip Top Trading. The office assistant Denise is losing her job, and today is her last day. Anna is busy with her work and trying to get everyone to sign Denise's leaving card.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>Paul, have you signed Denise's leaving card yet?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>No, not yet. Have you got a pen? &quot;Sorry to see you go. Best foot forward. Paul.&quot; There. I feel a bit guilty, it was me who got rid of her.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>Yeah. Well, you should feel really bad. I can't believe you're getting rid of her.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>Tom, do you want to sign the card?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>Yeah, of course. &quot;You are…were…the best employee we ever had. So sad to see you go. Kiss, kiss, kiss. Tom.&quot;</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>Gosh. Three kisses! Erm, you haven't given me any money for her leaving present yet, have you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>Oh sorry, a bit of a cash flow problem… Here, have a pound.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>That's generous!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>Oh crumbs, she's crying again. Anna, could you deal with her? I've got something important to do.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>Oh yeah. Me too.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>Denise, are you OK? Are you upset about leaving?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong><strong><br /></strong>Yes. I've loved working here. I've made some good friends… like you Anna… Oh, and being able to make free phone calls has been good.&nbsp; What am I going to do now?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><strong><br /></strong>Oh dear Anna. It sounds like Denise needs some career advice.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>Career advice?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><strong><br /></strong>She needs some guidance on what to do next and where to find another job. What would you do in her situation?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>Look in the newspaper, ring my contacts, register with a job agency?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><strong><br /></strong>Exactly! I'm sure you can give her some good advice. Go on, give it a go!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>OK, I'll try. Cheer up Denise, you need to think positively.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong><strong><br /></strong>Do I? I'm unemployed from tomorrow, how am I ever going to find another job?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>Well, have you tried looking in the job section of the newspaper?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong><strong><br /></strong>No.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>It's a good place to start. And there are loads of job-finding websites you could sign up for.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong><strong><br /></strong>I don't have a computer.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>Well what about ringing some of the people you know; contacts who may know about a job.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong><strong><br /></strong>Hmm, I hadn't thought about that.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>And of course, you could register with a recruitment agency. They're good at finding jobs for you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong><strong><br /></strong>Oh, that's a good idea. Anna, you're brilliant! What great ideas… you're so kind and… thoughtful.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>Anna could you… Oh no, she's crying again.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>Oh no, shall we go back into your office Paul?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>No, no. It's OK, Denise is crying with happiness. She's feeling better now.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>Oh well, in that case… shall we all gather round and officially say goodbye to Denise.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><strong><br /></strong>It's an emotional day for Denise, but Anna has been really useful with her career advice. If a professional career advisor is not available, giving some of your own advice can sometimes be useful. Let's hear again what Anna suggested…</p> 
 <p><em>You need to think positively.</em></p>

 <p><em>There are loads of job-finding websites you could sign up for.</em></p> 
 <p><em>What about ringing some of the people you know?</em></p> 
 <p><em>You could register with a recruitment agency.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>OK everyone, the time has come to say farewell to Denise. It's with regret we've had to let her go.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>We? You, Paul.</p> 
 <p><strong>Pau</strong><strong><br /></strong>Thank you for all your hard work and we wish you very well in the future.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>Anna, I think we have a gift for Denise?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>There you go Denise. Careful, it's quite heavy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong><strong><br /></strong>Oh, what a beautiful fruit bowl… and full of plastic fruit!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>I'll get it.&nbsp;Sorry about that everyone. That was a company called Nice'n'Cheesy, they remember you Anna. They liked your sales pitch and want to order a hundred thousand plastic grapes to go with their cheeses!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>What?! Brilliant! Ooops.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong><strong><br /></strong>My new fruit bowl!&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><strong><br /></strong>Oh dear. Poor Denise! It looks like she might be leaving the company at just the wrong time. I wonder if she'll be back? You'll have to join us again for the next episode of English at Work. Bye!</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator</strong><strong><br /></strong>Hello again and welcome to English at Work. It's another day at Tip Top Trading and hopefully a happier one, following Denise's bad news about her job. I wonder if Tom and Anna are about to get the same bad news?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>It's really awful having to let a member of your staff go but that's the situation we're in, I'm afraid.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>And now you're going to let us go aren't you? Honestly Paul, I've given my life to this company and, quite frankly, I'm disappointed… no, I'm angry at your decision. See your biscuits? Well…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>Tom!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>That's what I think of Tip Top Trading…</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>What?! Hold on Tom. I think you're a bit confused. I'm not sacking you too. I need to talk to you about plastic vegetables… you know, the aubergine idea?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>Oh… I see. You're not sacking us? Sorry Paul… I'll buy you some more biscuits. So what was it that you had to say?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>Plastic vegetables. Yours and Anna's idea for a plastic aubergine. I like it. It's good. So, I need you to develop a prototype we can use to show our potential clients.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>Well that's great. So where do we get the prototype made?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>Upstairs, on the 4th&nbsp;floor. We have a great development team who can magic up some amazing designs.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>They're magicians?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>No Anna. They're just developers who make things out of plastic.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><strong><br /></strong>Thank you Tom. Look, why not go and have a chat to them now and get the ball rolling.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>But we're not making balls<strong>.</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>Come on Anna… I'll explain. See you Paul.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><strong><br /></strong>'To get the ball rolling' – he means to get the project moving along. Developers can design and make models of your products which you can show and develop. But you need to give them clear and specific instructions. Let's see how Anna gets on.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>So this is the development team. Oh hi George, you up for footie on Sunday? Great. Have you met Anna before?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><strong><br /></strong>Hello.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>We've come to talk vegetables.</p> 
 <p><strong>George</strong><strong><br /></strong>Try the greengrocers!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><strong><br /></strong>Ha ha, very funny! No, we need a plastic aubergine making, mate. It's our new big idea.</p> 
 <p><strong>George<br /></strong>Easy. We can just remould the design for the Imperial Lemon.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Can they Anna? Is that what you wanted? To get what you want, you need to explain exactly your requirements.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>But what shall I say?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Tell them exactly what you were thinking by saying 'I have a specific idea in mind' and 'I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on how to improve my ideas' and, 'I'd like to use your design skills to produce a fantastic product'.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I see. OK, time for me to take control. George… this is quite a special project for us… isn't it Tom?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh yeah, right, absolutely.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>So we want to get it right and I already have a specific idea in mind.</p> 
 <p><strong>George<br /></strong>Great, sure, tell me more.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Well, based on a real aubergine, I was hoping it could be 20 centimetres in length, using grade 1 plastic resin, with a black-purple colour and a 30 degree curve on that side. Does that make sense?</p> 
 <p><strong>George<br /></strong>Erm yeah. Quite clear.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Obviously you are a designer, so I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on how to improve our idea.</p> 
 <p><strong>George<br /></strong>Well, it looks very impressive already. Gosh, Tom, where did you get her from?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>He didn't get me from anywhere. Now, I'd like to use your design skills to develop a fantastic product that I can show everyone. OK?</p> 
 <p><strong>George<br /></strong>Err… yes. I'll get onto it straight away.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Excellent Anna. Sometimes it's important to take control and say what you really want but in a positive and encouraging way. These are the phrases that Anna used:</p> 
 <p><em>I have a specific idea in mind.</em></p> 
 <p><em>I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on how to improve my ideas.</em></p> 
 <p><em>I'd like to use your design skills to produce a fantastic product.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>There's one more phrase to use to make sure things go to plan if someone is making something for you. That is 'I need to sign off your designs before they go into production', that means approve the plans before anything I made. Off you go Anna…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>…so when will you have the designs ready then?</p> 
 <p><strong>George<br /></strong>Hopefully by tomorrow morning. Is that OK?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>That will be great but I will need to sign off your designs before they go into production – that way, there won't be any mistakes – will there?</p> 
 <p><strong>George<br /></strong>Crikey Tom, she’s a bit bossy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>No! She's a pussy cat really… a bit of a softy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Now come on Tom. Fetch my things, we need to go and sort out a leaving present for Denise.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh yeah right, of course, see you George.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hmm, I think Tom's the pussy cat! Let's hope the designs come out well. But even more important is Denise's last day at work tomorrow – how is everyone going to cope? Find out next time on English at Work. Bye.</p>

"<p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Morning everyone. How did you get on at the conference?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh hi Denise. Yeah it was… it was OK.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>What do you mean 'OK'?&nbsp; It was great. We made some new contacts and we won an award – Best Plastic Innovation of the Year, for our Imperial Lemon.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Oh that's wonderful. Wish I'd been there.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Maybe next year eh?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Maybe?Welcome back to the offices of Tip Top Trading where everyone is catching up on yesterday's good news. But today it's bad news that everyone is going to hear following Paul’s chat with the big boss, Mr Socrates. But how bad is it? Let's find out.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Morning everyone.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Hi Paul. Everything OK?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Yes, fine. Well done for winning Employee of the Year – I hope you can continue to be a great employee. Excuse me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Hmm, he sounded odd. What did he mean?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Probably run out of biscuits!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>He's obviously got something on his mind.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Denise, could I have a word with you in my office please?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Of course. I'll bring my notepad and pen shall I?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>What's that all about? Anyway, now we're alone, I wanted to see what you're doing tonight… are you free?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Sorry Tom, I'm seeing Dave tonight. He's offered to fix something on my computer at home.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh, has he now?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>All the years I've worked here – why me? Why now?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Denise, what's up?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Paul says he needs to <em>move the furniture around</em> and he has to <em>let me go</em>. He says he can't afford me anymore.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>That's terrible… but where's he letting you go to? And what furniture is he moving?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>No Anna! If someone says they are '<em>moving the furniture</em>' they really mean they are restructuring or changing the business. And if they say '<em>they have to let you go</em>', it means they are sacking you or in other words, ending your job.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Sacking you? Oh, that is serious. Denise, I'm really sorry to hear this. But why does Paul want to '<em>move the furniture</em>' around?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>He says it's because of the tough economic situation. My role is no longer needed</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Hey, that's not true. You make a great cup of tea Denise. I've got a good mind to smash Paul's bourbons into tiny crumbs. Grrr.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Calm down Tom. Now Denise, when did Paul say you had to go?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>He's given me <em>seven days' notice</em>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>A '<em>notice period</em>' is an amount of time an employer must give an employee if they plan to terminate their employment.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>I never thought I would be <em>facing redundancy</em>… not now… not at my age.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong><em>Redundancy</em>?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Yes, if someone says '<em>they are facing redundancy</em>', it’s another way of saying they are losing their job. Hmm, I think Denise needs a shoulder to cry on.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes. Denise, do you want my shoulder to cry on?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Oh thanks.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Urgh! Erm… Denise, I've just made some tea would you like a cup?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Oh yes please.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Here you go. You know Denise, you've got to think positively. You'll get another job… and let's face it you didn't like working here anyway… you always looked so miserable.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>I don't think Tom's attempts to cheer Denise up are going to work! Losing your job can be a traumatic experience. It can come as a surprise and a shock. Let's hear the phrases Paul used to break the news to Denise:</p> 
 <p><em>We've got to move the furniture around.</em></p> 
 <p><em>I'm afraid I've got to let you go.</em></p> 
 <p><em>I'm giving you seven days' notice.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And here are some other expressions you may hear in connection with losing your job:</p> 
 <p><em>Facing redundancy</em></p> 
 <p><em>Getting the sack</em></p> 
 <p><em>Terminating your employment</em></p> 
 <p><em>Leaving the company</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Right, well, I might as well start clearing out my desk.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yeah it's a real shame. Any chance I could have your stapler?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Tom, you could be a bit more sympathetic.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh right.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Tom, Anna. Could I have a word in my office please?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh no. This is it. It's my turn to get the chop!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Ha, You might not need my stapler after all!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Crikey! Things aren't looking good at Tip Top Trading. Are Tom and Anna getting the chop… I mean, the sack?&nbsp; Join us again next time on English at Work.</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Welcome back to English at Work. Paul, Anna and Tom are at an important International Plastics Conference. It’s been a busy day of networking but the big boss from America, Mr Socrates, has told Paul some bad news. Before he tells the team, there is an important award to be won – the Plastic Innovation of the Year award. Will Tip Top Trading win it?</p> 
 <p>I hope you've written your acceptance speech Anna.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes, I'm just doing it now.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>You've left it a bit late.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I've been so busy and now I'm really struggling. I don't know what to write.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well, don't forget to say &quot;<em>On behalf of everyone at Tip Top Trading, thank you for our award</em>&quot;. Or, you could say &quot;<em>our company is at the forefront of plastic innovation</em>&quot;. Tell the audience &quot;<em>this award is a real boost for everyone working at the company</em>&quot;. Say that and you'll be fine.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>…working at the company. Good, got it. Thanks. Oh hi Tom, how have you got on?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Great great. I've been hanging out with some of our clients – keeping them sweet, you know what I mean?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Err, I don't actually know. But I've had some success. Oh, here comes Paul.&nbsp; Hi Paul.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Oh hello. Having a good day?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes, we're just talking about our success – let's hope we win that Plastic Innovation of the Year award, eh?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Oh yes... let's hope so. Although that means I've got to read out that speech you wrote for me. Public speaking is not really one of my things.</p> 
 <p><strong>Host<br /></strong>Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats for our special award ceremony.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>OK, here's your speech Paul.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>We've got to win first.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Shhh shhh. Listen!</p> 
 <p><strong>Host<br /></strong>Thank you everyone for attending this year's conference. As you know, the highlight of the day is announcing the winner of our Plastic Innovation Award. So, without further ado, let's find out who this year's winner is. It is… Tip Top Trading for their Imperial Lemon.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Hey, that's us. We've actually won!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Oh crumbs. I suppose I'd better do my speech now.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yeah… go on Paul you can do it!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>OK, right. Whooah… ouch.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh no. Paul's tripped over that chair.</p> 
 <p><strong>Host<br /></strong>Is there anyone from Tip Top Trading here?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Anna, you'll have to do the speech – you did write it after all.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>What me?! I can't.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Go on. You'll be fine and besides I'm no good at public speaking.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Yes you can do it Anna! Just start by saying '<em>ladies and gentlemen</em>'.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh, if I have to. Erm… <em>ladies and gentlemen. On behalf of everyone at Tip Top Trading, thank you for our award… our company is at the forefront of plastic innovation.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yeah!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Erm… thanks Tom. <em>This award is a real boost for everyone working at the company</em>. We pride ourselves on innovation, quality and err… plastic fruit. And coming soon, we'll be launching a new plastic aubergine.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Ow, my big toe!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>So thank you everyone, this really means a lot to us.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Brilliant Anna.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Yes splendid. Well done Anna.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well done indeed. Anna saved the day again by making that speech. She sounded confident and genuinely happy about getting the award. Here's a reminder of some of things she said:</p> 
 <p><em>Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of everyone at Tip Top Trading, thank you for our award.</em></p> 
 <p><em>Our company is at the forefront of plastic innovation.</em></p> 
 <p><em>This award is a real boost for everyone working at the company.</em></p> 
 <p><em>This award really means a lot to us.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Are you OK now Paul?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Yes, sorry, that was rather unfortunate and a bit embarrassing too, but… hold on… what's happening now?</p> 
 <p><strong>Host<br /></strong>Ladies and gentlemen, before you go, we have one more award to present.</p> 
 <p><strong>Everyone<br /></strong>Oooh!</p> 
 <p><strong>Host<br /></strong>We have a special award. 'Employee of the Year'. This recognises someone’s achievements and contribution to the plastics industry.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>At last, I've been recognised.</p> 
 <p><strong>Host<br /></strong>Please welcome Brad Socrates from Tip Top Trading International to award the prize.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>Out the way. Where's the Goddamn envelope?&nbsp; OK, right, and the award goes to… Anna from Tip Top Trading.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Me? Bbbut I…</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Go on Anna. You deserve it. Go and make another speech!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Thank you everyone – this is amazing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>This girl is amazing. In just one year she has risen from an apprentice to a champion. It's great to have her on board.&nbsp;I think we should talk about your salary later hey?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Can things get any better for Anna? I think they can. Join us again soon for more English at Work. Bye.</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Welcome back to English at Work. It's the big day of the International Plastics Conference and a good opportunity for the staff at Tip Top Trading to promote its business. But hold on, who's this? It's Mr Socrates, the big boss from America.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>Hey, you guys, where have you been?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Ah, Mr Socrates… nice to see you again. I'd heard you were in town.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna/Tom<br /></strong>Hello Mr Socrates.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>I've been looking for you everywhere. I need to catch up with you and see how business is going.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Oh very, <span data-mce-mark=""1"">very</span> well. We're selling Imperial Lemons to France and Anna is developing plastic vegetables.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>Ah Anna! My favourite girl. Still doing a good job?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I'm doing my best.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>In fact she's been doing my job for a few days… had a bit of a biscuit accident…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>Yeah, well that's not hard for you, Paul. Listen, listen I need to talk you - shouldn't the others be doing some networking now?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Of course, that's why we’re here. Right, Tom, I need you to catch up with some of our existing customers – do some schmoozing – and Anna, could you talk to some potential new customers? I need to speak to Mr Socrates.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Right. Erm, networking… what exactly am I supposed to do?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Networking is about helping your business through connecting with other people in the industry. It involves meeting people and talking to them, sharing information, hopefully helping each other and ultimately, getting new business.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>So I have to talk to strangers?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well, yes. Introduce yourself, say who you work for. Ask them about their business and what they do. Then explain a bit about what you do and who uses your products. If it's appropriate, say that you may be able to help them. Then see if they would consider buying from you. Just be chatty and friendly.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Thanks. I'll give it a try. Excuse me, hello, I'm Anna. I work as a Sales Executive at Tip Top Trading… and you are?</p> 
 <p><strong>Woman<br /></strong>Jane. Jane from Nice'n'Cheesy. It's very busy here today isn't it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>It is. It's my first time here but it's very exciting. I really didn't know what to wear.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Anna! That's chatty and friendly, but let's get down to business.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh yes, of course. So can you tell me about your company, Nice'n'Cheesy?</p> 
 <p><strong>Woman<br /></strong>Well, we sell cheese to London's top cheese shops - we like to say we're a wedge above the rest – a wedge of cheese, get it?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Err, right. Well, can I briefly tell you about what our company does? Our company – Tip Top Trading – makes plastic fruit mainly for the catering and food industry. We're up for an award today for one of our designs.</p> 
 <p><strong>Woman<br /></strong>Smashing. That's quite interesting actually. We have an issue with the fresh grapes we provide with our cheeses – they keep going mouldy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh dear.</p> 
 <p><strong>Woman<br /></strong>Yes – sour grapes you could say! A good quality plastic grape would be useful to put with our cheese displays.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Well, I think we might be able to help you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Yes you can! This is the time to exchange contact details – give her your business card.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Well, if I could have your contact details I'll send you one of our brochures and then give you a call about prices.&nbsp; And here's my business card should you want to call me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Woman<br /></strong>That's fantastic. So nice to have met you – and I think what you're wearing for the conference is perfect.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Thanks!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Bingo! Looks like Anna has a potential new customer. She was friendly and chatty but kept her mind on business. She used phrases like these:</p> 
 <p><em>Excuse me, hello, I'm Anna. I work as a Sales Executive at Tip Top Trading.</em></p> 
 <p><em>Can you tell me about your company?</em></p> 
 <p><em>Can I briefly tell you about what our company does?</em></p> 
 <p><em>I think we might be able to help you.</em></p> 
 <p><em>Here's my business card should you want to call.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>So, some good work by Anna but there's more networking to be done. A conference is a good place for networking and for catching up with your boss, too. Let's find out how Paul is getting on with Mr Socrates.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>It's a tough economic climate Paul. We're already cutting out cookies in management meetings.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Oh, gosh.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>And now we're cutting staff. We've already lost Rachel – my favourite Sales Executive.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Ah yes, well, she was stealing the pens.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>Pens can be replaced but not people like her.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Well…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>But now it's time to reduce your team Paul – share the pain.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Are you sure?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>Absolutely. By my calculations you need to be rid of one member of staff.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Oh… well let's not tell the team until we've had the awards ceremony.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>OK Paul. But it's in your hands to sort this out.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Crumbs!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Ah yes, Tip Top Trading could be about to win a prestigious award but how will this bad news go down with the team? And what is Paul going to do? Find out next time on English at Work.</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Welcome back to English at Work. Anna is acting up as boss because Paul had an accident with a biscuit! But her and Tom are in a panic after finding a note in Paul's diary that said 'Socrates, IPC, final'. Could it mean bad news for Tip Top Trading? Let’s find out.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>It's very odd and it can't be good. But Socrates must mean Mr Socrates.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes – but IPC? What's that mean?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yeah and <em>final</em> sounds very… final.&nbsp; Hmm… I've got it! IPC – it must be code for imminent post closures – they're going to sack us all!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Sshh. Keep your voice down. Don't tell everyone. Let's check things out first, don't say anything yet. OK?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>OK. Mum's the word.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Your mum knows?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>No, no, no, it's our little secret. See you later.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Everything OK Tom?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh yeah, everything's cool. Actually Denise, it's not. I think we're all going to be sacked tomorrow by Mr Socrates.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>What?! No! I've got a hairdresser's appointment on Saturday, how am I going to pay for it now? What am I going to do? I know, I'll call Marge.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Hey Brian, Pete… we're all going to be sacked tomorrow.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Erm… Anna, you've got a problem brewing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>What?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Tom's spreading rumours about job cuts. Everyone's starting to panic.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh no! I'd better do something but what shall I say?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Call a meeting quickly. Tell the team 'there are some rumours going around that are not true'. Say, 'I am trying to establish the facts and I will let you know as soon as I have some information'. You could say 'I would be grateful if you hear any rumours, not to pass them on'. This can be a tricky situation and you need to handle it well. Good luck!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Gosh. This is hard but here goes. Excuse me, could everyone gather round please.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Is this about the sackings?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>No Denise. Any rumours about sackings are not true.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yeah that's right. Who told you that Denise?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Hmmm…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Please don't listen to rumours. I am trying to establish the facts and if I get any information I will let you know straight away.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>But I heard Mr Socrates is coming tomorrow, surely he’s going to sack us.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Ignore the rumours and please don't pass them on.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Anna. Tell them to carry on with their work as normal.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Right, yes. Could you please just carry on with your work as normal. Thank you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>So Anna, how are you going to find out the facts?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I'm going to have to call Paul – in private Tom – I don't want any more rumours getting out.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh yeah, absolutely. You need to establish the facts right?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Hello, Paul speaking.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh hi Paul. It's Anna. Sorry to bother you. Are you feeling better?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Much better thanks but keeping clear of biscuits for a while! Anyway, is everything OK?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Not exactly. There are rumours spreading about job cuts. Tom saw a note in your diary for tomorrow that said 'Socrates, IPC'.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Hmm. Really? Oh yes. I mean, oh no! It's not job cuts – it's IPC - the International Plastics Conference tomorrow! And Mr Socrates is flying in for it. Oh golly gosh, I'd forgotten about that.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I see. And why did you right <em>final</em>?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Because there's an award being given for the Best Plastic Innovation – and we're in the final with our Imperial Lemon.&nbsp; It was a reminder to me to write an acceptance speech. Oh golly gosh, I haven't written a thing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh dear. What are we going to do?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>What are you going to do indeed? But thank goodness those rumours of job cuts are not true. Tomorrow could actually be a good day for Tip Top Trading. Here's a reminder of the phrases Anna used to try and control the spread of some office rumours:</p> 
 <p><em>There are some rumours going around that are not true.</em></p> 
 <p><em>Please don't listen to rumours. </em></p> 
 <p><em>I am trying to establish the facts and if I get any information I will let you know straight away.</em></p> 
 <p><em>Ignore the rumours and please don’t pass them on.</em></p> 
 <p><em>Please just carry on with your work as normal. Thank you.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Tomorrow is going to be an important day at the International Plastics Conference. Mr Socrates will be there and Tip Top Trading could pick up a prestigious prize but who’s going to write the acceptance speech?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>OK Anna, this calls for some urgent action. I want you and Tom to meet me at the Princess Diana Conference Centre tomorrow at 9.00.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Right. And what about the speech?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Well, I've got quite a lot on my plate so I was wondering if you could give it a go… please?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Me?! I've never done it before. What am I going to say?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Don't worry Anna. We’re here to help. Join us again soon for some more English at Work. Bye!</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Welcome back to English at Work. Last time we heard Anna pitching her new plastic aubergine idea to Paul, in a lift. He was on his way to a biscuit-lovers' convention and didn't have much time. She gave the perfect elevator pitch but it's down to Paul to give her idea the go ahead – the problem is, he seems to have gone missing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Denise, isn't Paul supposed to be here today?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Yes. He went to that biscuit-lovers' convention yesterday but he said he'd be back today.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Maybe he's eloped with a pack of custard creams, eh?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Very funny Tom. I'll give him a call now <em>…</em>oh, that might be him now. Hello, Tip Top Trading… oh hello Paul, everything OK? ...oh no! ...oh no!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>What Denise?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>He choked on a biscuit at the convention and he's in hospital. <em>(To Paul)</em> Yes Paul, that was Tom… you want to speak to Anna? I'll just get her… get better soon Paul. <em>(To Anna)</em> Anna, Anna, it's Paul on the phone, he wants to speak to you – sounds important.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Me? Oh right, can you transfer the call please? Hello Paul, are you OK?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Not really. Damn Garibaldi biscuit got wedged in my throat, ended up banging my head on a table trying to get it out.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh dear, so you're not coming to work today?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>I'm afraid not, I need to rest for a few days so I was wondering, in fact I'm asking you, could you act up?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I've told you before Paul, I can't act… or even sing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>No, no Anna. Act up, I mean do my job for a bit – be the boss – just for a day or two.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Me?! Be the boss?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom/Denise<br /></strong>What?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>It's quite easy really. Just check my diary and you'll see what needs doing. And if you have any problems just… erm… just ask Denise. Thanks Anna<strong>.</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>That's great Anna. You've got all the skills to do Paul's job – maybe even more! But you need to take charge and show who's boss!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh right. But what should I say?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well, don't be too bossy, but you could say: &quot;If anyone has any issues about their work please come and speak to me&quot;, or, &quot;I would like to have a meeting to discuss our work&quot;, or, &quot;If there's anything you want to ask, my door is always open&quot;. That makes you sound like a very approachable boss! Good luck.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Thanks.<br /></span>Right everyone, as you know Paul has put me in charge for a while.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>I'm not being funny Anna, but why you? I mean, I've been here the longest.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Tom, if you have any issues about your work, please come and speak to me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh right… I will then.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Erm… Anna… congratulations on your promotion. I just wondered, now you're in charge, could I do a little less admin and a bit more selling?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Let's see Denise. I'd like to have a meeting soon to discuss all our work, so we can talk about it then. OK?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Oh yes, thanks Anna.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Right then. It's business as usual and if there's anything you want to ask, my door is always open. Right, back to work… and Tom, could I have a word in my office now please?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Excellent work Anna. You're sounding like the boss already – just don't start eating biscuits! Being in charge means being firm but fair and keeping your cool. Here's a reminder of some of the phrases Anna used:</p> 
 <p><em>If anyone has any issues about their work please come and speak to me.</em></p> 
 <p><em>I would like to have a meeting to discuss our work.</em></p> 
 <p><em>If there is anything you want to ask, my door is always open.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Take a seat Tom. Could you please close the door?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>I thought &quot;your door was always open&quot;?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Not this time. I need to speak to you about this message in Paul's diary. &nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh, right, I see. You need my help? What does it say?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>It's for two days' time and it says, <em>Socrates, IPC, final</em>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh no, that doesn't sound good.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Oh dear, what could that mean? Could there be trouble ahead? Join us again soon to find out. Bye.</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to English at Work. The company's computer system has been fixed and Anna seems to have found a new friend in Dave, the IT support man. But her main concern now is pitching her new idea for a plastic aubergine, to Paul the boss.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>So Anna, that guy didn't really know what he was doing did he?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>You mean Dave?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Dave – was that his name? He had a really bad smell.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>No he didn't. He's done a great job. Look everything is working so, if you don't mind, I think we should get this pitch for Paul finished.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>You'd better hurry up. Paul's taking the afternoon off to go to his biscuit lovers’ convention.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh right. Well, we might as well leave it until tomorrow then Anna.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>No Tom. There’s no time like the present – I heard someone say that once – we've got to get our idea to Paul as soon as possible. Then we might have time for a drink, or shall I ask Dave?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>No, no, you're right. Look, I'll design some pictures of the aubergine and you get the results of our survey together, yeah?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Great.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well done Anna. Remember to make your pitch clear and exciting. Really sell it with words like '<em>exceptional!', 'fantastic!', 'quality', 'profit', 'efficiency', and 'value for money'.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>OK, I've got all that. I'm just adding some of the facts and figures from our customer survey.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Anna, I've got the designs, they're coming off the printer now.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Denise, I’m off now. Can’t wait any longer for my garibaldis!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Wait Paul! I need to tell you about our new product idea.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Well, I, I, have to go. Can you tell me about it in the lift?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>In the lift? Do I have to?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Sorry Anna, but that's the only time I’ve got.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Right Anna. It's time for your 'elevator pitch' – an elevator is an American word for lift. You’ll need to pitch your idea quickly and concisely. You need to tell Paul what the product is and who your market is. Then talk about how you hope it will make money for the company. Talk about the evidence you have that it will be successful and convince him it will really benefit the business.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Phew, there's a lot to say in a short time but here goes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Anna, could you just press the 0 button there, thanks.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Now Paul. Tom and I have come up with a new exciting product – the plastic aubergine.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Oh yes?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes. This fantastic product will be a great addition to table decorations in the caf&eacute; and restaurant market.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Will it now? Do you really think it will be a profitable addition to our plastic portfolio?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh yes. Using the same plastics as our fruits, we can easily re-mould our bananas and change the colour. We can increase efficiency but maintain quality.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>And profits?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>By my calculations, we can increase profits by 20%. That's based on selling the same quantity that we now sell of Imperial Lemons.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Hmm, 20%, really? But do you know who’s going to buy this product?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I do. We've conducted a survey and already found 10 new companies who would buy this and 27 existing customers who have shown an interest in it…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>…and I'm confident this new product will be a huge success.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Very impressive. You've certainly done your homework. Look, let me chew it over – probably on a custard cream – and I'll get back to you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Thanks. Paul, Paul… you've forgotten your bag.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Oh yes, I'll need that. Thanks.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Great work Anna! You convinced me but have you convinced Paul?</p> 
 <p>So Anna's done her first 'elevator pitch' and kept to the facts. Here's a reminder of some of the things she said:</p> 
 <p><em>We've come up with an exciting new product.</em></p> 
 <p><em>This fantastic product will be a great addition to table decorations in the caf&eacute; and restaurant market.</em></p> 
 <p><em>We can increase efficiency but maintain quality. </em></p> 
 <p><em>By my calculations, we can increase profits by 20%.</em></p> 
 <p><em>I'm confident this new product will be a huge success.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>So, how did it go Anna?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I'm not sure. I told Paul as much as I could and I think he listened.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Good, good. So, what are you doing now?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I've got to meet someone.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Anyone I know?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>No, not really.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>It's Dave from IT isn't it? What does she see in him?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Do you want me to answer that Tom?! Anna may have fallen for the charms of Dave but let's hope she keeps her mind on her plastic aubergines. Join us again next time on English at Work.&nbsp;</p>

"<p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>It's frozen. Nothing will work…</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yeah and all my football scores… I mean company accounts… have disappeared.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Can anyone get their computers to work? Or is just me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Welcome back to the offices of Tip Top Trading where, as you can hear, there appears to be a bit of computer trouble. Everyone's work seems to have disappeared. This is serious so who can sort it out?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Leave it to me. I'll sort it out.&nbsp;You just need to switch it off… and on again … like that.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Hold on, let's check… Denise! All <span>my</span> documents have gone now!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Oh, sorry, I was just trying to help. You'll just have to call I.T. Support, look, here’s their number.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>'It' Support?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>No Anna not 'it' but I.T. Support – information technology – sometimes called Computer Support. Most big companies have them. These are the people who sort out your computer problems and get everything working again. But be careful, they might ask some tricky questions.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>OK, thanks. But what should I say to them?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Tell them: <em>&quot;I am having problems with my computer&quot;</em>, then say <em>&quot;the screen keeps freezing&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;I seem to have lost some documents&quot;</em>. Tell them <em>&quot;I have turned the computer off and on but that hasn't fixed it&quot;</em>. Finally, <em>ask if they can help – please!</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Well, I'll give it a try. Here goes.</p> 
 <p><strong>I.T. Man<br /></strong>I.T., Dave speaking, how can I help?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh hello Dave – <em>I'm having some computer problems</em> – in fact everyone is here.</p> 
 <p><strong>I.T.&nbsp;Man<br /></strong>Right. What system are you using?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>What system?</p> 
 <p><strong>I.T.&nbsp;Man<br /></strong>Yeah, what are you using? PC, laptop, Windows XP?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Tell him it's Windows 7.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Erm… it's Windows 7 on a PC.</p> 
 <p><strong>I.T.&nbsp;Man<br /></strong>Good, good, this should be easy. Were you using many applications when it crashed?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Applications?</p> 
 <p><strong>I.T.&nbsp;Man<br /></strong>Did you have lots of things open – documents, spreadsheets, videos, other software?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Well, I suppose I did.</p> 
 <p><strong>I.T.&nbsp;Man<br /></strong>Right, well… Anna isn't it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes.</p> 
 <p><strong>I.T.&nbsp;Man<br /></strong>Right, well Anna, try pressing control, alt, delete, at the same time – after that try opening Windows again.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>OK. Tom, could you open the windows please.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>What eh? The windows?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes. Dave says so.</p> 
 <p><strong>I.T.&nbsp;Man<br /></strong>No, no, no. Open Windows 7 on your computer.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh, silly me!&nbsp;No, <em>the screen just freezes</em>. I'm a bit worried because <em>I think I've lost some documents</em>.</p> 
 <p><strong>I.T.&nbsp;Man<br /></strong>Hmmm. In that case the only thing to do is reboot it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Reboot it?You mean kick it?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>No! Reboot means turn it on and off again.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh I see. No Dave,<em> I have already tried turning it off and on again but that hasn't fixed it</em>. What am I going to do?</p> 
 <p><strong>I.T.&nbsp;Man<br /></strong>Don't panic! I'll come and have a look. You're on the 2nd&nbsp;floor right?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Oh dear. This is a bit worrying but I'm sure Dave, the IT man, will get things sorted. Remember if you have important documents, it's best to back them up on a memory stick just in case you have a problem like this.&nbsp; Let's remind ourselves of the phrases we might use if we have to call computer support: &nbsp;</p> 
 <p><em>I am having problems with my computer</em></p> 
 <p><em>The screen keeps freezing</em></p> 
 <p><em>I seem to have lost some documents</em></p> 
 <p><em>I have turned the computer off and on but that hasn't fixed it</em></p> 
 <p><em>Can you help, please?</em></p> 
 <p><strong>I.T.&nbsp;Man<br /></strong>Oh hi. Is Anna here? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>She's over there.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>So Anna, I'm just going to unplug the screen and put the wire back in here…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>OK Tom but are you OK down there? Mind your head.</p> 
 <p><strong>I.T.&nbsp;Man<br /></strong>Excuse me, are you Anna? I've come to fix your computer.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh, hello… you must be… Dave. I really like your hair.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Ow!</p> 
 <p><strong>I.T.&nbsp;Man<br /></strong>Thanks. You look rather lovely. I'd better take a look at your computer.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Don't worry guys, it’s OK, I think I've fixed it!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Looks like Tom has a rival. Is Anna going to fall for the charms of Dave, the I.T. man, or is he just going to upgrade her software? This could get very interesting – but there's still work to be done – so join us again soon for English at Work. Bye.&nbsp;</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello again. Last time on English at Work, we heard Anna leaving Tom crying into his cold pizza. He may not have had the evening he was expecting, but for Anna it was a huge success. She came up with an idea for a new plastic vegetable and now she needs to pitch it to Paul, the boss.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>… so I think I'll go for the blue, Marge, it matches my eyes… well almost…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Morning Denise!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Oh, hello Anna&nbsp;<em>…</em>yes, Anna, bright girl, what she sees in Tom I'll never know… what?!... ha, ha, I'm sure you would…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh hi Tom. You're in early.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Uh? Oh yeah, couldn't sleep after you'd left.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Tom, it was a fantastic night – unforgettable in fact. Thanks so much.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Did you hear that Marge? She said it was 'unforgettable'!&nbsp; Looks like they're getting very serious…</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>You're such a gossip, Denise.&nbsp; The only thing Anna is serious about is her new idea.&nbsp; How's it going Anna?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I'm really excited about launching a new product, although Tom doesn't seem so keen. &nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Don't worry about him. You need to concentrate on convincing Paul that your new idea will bring in the business.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>But how?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>You need to pitch the idea to him but before that, you need to do some research.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes, of course – research – but how do I do that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Check out the competition, work out some costs and find out what new product people would really like to see. Why not do a customer survey?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>A customer survey. Right. But what should I ask?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Say: 'Could I ask for your opinion on a new product we are hoping to develop?' 'What plastic products do you currently use?', 'What products would you like us to make in the future?', 'How do you feel about the idea of selling plastic vegetables?', 'Any particular vegetable you would like to see?'</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>OK, so it's like a questionnaire. I need to do some cold calling again!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Good luck!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I think I'm going to need some help with this. Tom, Denise, have you got time to help me… please?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Of course Anna.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yeah, well it's a bit tricky with my… ouch… sprained arm. But go on. As it's you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Thanks. We need to call up some companies and find out how interested they would be in buying plastic vegetables.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Oh lovely. I love talking to people on the phone.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>You certainly do Denise!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Good Denise. If you work your way through our business directory, call our existing customers and ask these questions.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>I'll get onto it straight away.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Great, and Tom, could you help me by cold calling some new businesses?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh yeah sure. I've got loads of contacts.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I suppose I had better make some calls too.&nbsp;Hmm, let's try this one. 7-4-3-9-1-0-0</p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>Hello. Plastic Purr-fection. Can I help you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh hi. I'm Anna from Tip Top Trading, we make and sell plastic fruits. I'm trying some to get some opinions on a new product we're trying to develop. Can you spare a few minutes to help me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>Well I'm quite busy at the moment but I'll try and help.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Thank you. I'll be as quick as I can.&nbsp; Firstly, what plastic products do you use at the moment?</p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>All sorts – plastic balls, plastic fish, plastic mice…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Plastic mice?! Oh, I see. And… errr… what sort of things would you like us to sell… in the future?</p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>Let's think… erm … more squeaky toys.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Squeaky toys?! What about plastic vegetables?</p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>Do they squeak?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Err, not really. I think there might be some confusion here. Do you use plastic fruits in restaurants and shops?</p> 
 <p><strong>Man</strong></p> 
 <p>No. We just sell plastic toys… for cats, hence the name 'plastic purr-fection'.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh I see, ha, ha. A good name, but, I'm sorry you're not really the business I was looking for. Thanks for your time anyway. Bye.</p> 
 <p><strong>Man<br /></strong>Bye. Get down Tiddles!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Uh-oh Anna. It's a good idea to check exactly what type of business you are calling before carrying out your survey. Better luck next time!&nbsp; If you're doing some research and want to get the opinions of your customers, here's a reminder of the questions you could ask:</p> 
 <p><em>Could I ask for your opinion on a new product we are hoping to develop? </em></p> 
 <p><em>What plastic products do you currently use? </em></p> 
 <p><em>What products would you like to see us sell in the future? </em></p> 
 <p><em>How do you feel about the idea of selling plastic vegetables? </em></p> 
 <p><em>Any particular vegetable you would like to see?</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Let's find out how the team is getting on.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>That was fun. I called 10 companies, asked them your questions – one man asked me out for dinner – anyway, I've created a database and put all the information there.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Well I've called 20 companies and they all say plastic vegetables would be a great addition to their range… especially aubergines!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Great. Well, I had some success too so I'll put all the results in that database.&nbsp; Thanks everyone. Oh no… what's happened? &nbsp;Denise! Denise! Everything's disappeared off the computer!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Hey, my computer's gone blank. We've lost all our documents!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Oh no a computer crash! Has Tip Top Trading lost all its valuable information? Find out next time in English at Work. Bye!</p>

"<p><strong>Waiter<br /></strong>Would you like to see the menu?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh yes please.</p> 
 <p><strong>Waiter<br /></strong>I was asking the lady actually.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh, right.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello again. Anna and Tom are finally on their dinner date at a pizza restaurant. Eating could be difficult for Tom because he's sprained his arm after that accident in the office. He might still have romance on his mind but Anna is thinking about something else. Are you feeling nervous Anna?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Nervous? Why?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Being out on your own with Tom. What are you going to talk about?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Don't worry. I can handle this, besides I want Tom's ideas about developing a new plastic vegetable.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>A plastic vegetable! Oh right. Well, good luck.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>So, this is nice. Finally, us together, on our own, me and you, pizza, red wine… expensive red wine, actually.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Lovely, Tom. You know Tom, Paul wants me to develop a new idea – plastic vegetables – I thought, maybe, you might like to help me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Come on Anna, we're not here to talk business. Tell me about you – the real Anna. Have you had many… err, many boyfriends before?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>That's a bit personal. What do you think about plastic peas?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Err? Can you not switch off from work for one minute?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Tom. I think you and me are very similar – we're a good team. If we could come up with a great idea for Paul then who knows… we may get to travel the world selling it together?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh, I see. I hadn't thought of it like that. Right well…</p> 
 <p><strong>Waiter<br /></strong>Your pizzas… madam… sir.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Thanks. Tom, I think you'll need some help cutting that.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Thanks. Mmm, you smell nice… or is that the pizza?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I've got it!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>What?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Plastic aubergines!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Plastic aubergines?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes. Plastic aubergines. They would look great on this table – a sort of decoration.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yeah! And you could put sauces inside… or salt and pepper. You could be on to something here.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>We need to put a proposal together, to give it to Paul. But what should we say?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Anna, your proposal needs to be brief but clear. Use positive language to propose your idea to Paul. Use words like '<em>exceptional</em>', '<em>fantastic</em>', '<em>quality</em>', and talk about how it would benefit the business by using words like '<em>profit</em>', '<em>efficiency</em>', and '<em>value for money</em>'. Good luck!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Are you OK Anna?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes. Just writing some things down.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>OK, well write down how we could target restaurants and cafes. They'll be begging for our vegetables. Oh this is so exciting… let's drink to our… succ… Oh!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Tom! What have you done? You've knocked red wine all over me… and my notebook.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Ermm, sorry. We had better get you out of that dress.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hmm, what a mess and what a date! But what may be lacking in romance is made up for in a potentially successful business deal. Let's find out how it's going much much later at Tom's flat…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>…this <em>exceptional</em> product has <em>fantastic</em> potential…</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Say 'demand for this plastic aubergine will reach melting point!' My little joke.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>…by making the production more <em>efficient</em>, our customers will get <em>value for money</em> and our <em>profits</em> will increase. There, done.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Great. We can pitch this to Paul first thing on Monday morning. So now, maybe we can get back to our date? Look I saved some of that pizza.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>It's all cold! Anyway, I had better go. It's late and I want to tidy up this proposal. But it's been great. I can't wait till next time.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Bbbut…Next time?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well, that went well! The pizza may be cold but Anna and Tom have developed a red hot proposal. Here's a reminder of some of the words you might want to use to make your business proposal stand out…</p> 
 <p><em>Exceptional!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Fantastic!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Quality.</em></p> 
 <p><em>Profit.</em></p> 
 <p><em>Efficiency.</em></p> 
 <p><em>Value for money.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>So with the proposal written, Tom and Anna just need to convince Paul – and that means pitching their idea. Find out how they get on next time. Bye for now.</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Welcome back to the offices of Tip Top Trading where Tom has taken a tumble. He was trying to catch a mouse but tripped over. Can Anna help soothe the pain? Let's find out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Ooh… oww… ouch. My arm really hurts.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>What's all this noise about?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>It's Tom. He's had an accident – tripped over a mouse – I mean tripped over trying to catch a mouse.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Golly gosh. Are you OK Tom?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>I dunno. I think I've broken something.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Your pencil I think! Just sit there at my desk and I'll go and call a first-aider.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Anna,you're going to have to fill in one of those Health and Safety reports.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh really? Do we have to?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>It's procedure and it's the law – it's got to be done.&nbsp; Now Tom, would a biscuit make you feel better?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Health and Safety is important in the workplace. The office needs to be a safe place to work in, but accidents do happen and that's when you have to report it. Anna, do you know where to find the form you need to fill in?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I think so. It's here on the company intranet… here it is, 'accident report form'.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Yes, it's sometimes called an 'incident or accident report form'. It will ask you: <em>How did the accident happen? What was the cause of the accident? Were there any injuries? And how could the accident have been avoided?</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>OK, I had better get started.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Right, I've call the first-aider. She'll be here in ten minutes. Now, do you need a hand with this form, Anna?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes please Denise. It wants to know <em>how the accident happened.</em>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Just say there was a mouse… no, a large rat… running about that needed catching. And Tom, very bravely, tried to catch it</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes… and then he tripped over something.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Was it your ego Tom?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Err? Ha ha. Ouch! No, it was a sample box of Perfect Peaches.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>So, <em>the cause of the accident</em> was a box of Perfect Peaches left on the floor. Who left them there anyway?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>That might have been me Denise.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>What do I always say about putting things away? Now Anna, it says here <em>'Were there any injuries?'</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>So I'll write, 'Yes, a member of staff broke his arm.'</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Sprainedhis arm. I think he'd be in a lot more pain if it was broken, hey Tom?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>What? Err, yeah. It still hurts though.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Hmm! Now finally it says <em>'What can be done to avoid this accident again?'</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Get rid of the mice… I mean rats?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>No. Store things away properly and keep the office tidy, eh Tom?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yeah, I suppose so… but I was only trying to catch that mouse.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>I know, very heroic. I'm starting to see what Anna sees in you, you know.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh no, Anna, our dinner date!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>So, it's been an eventful day in the office. Anna has done the proper thing by completing an accident report form. If you have to report an accident at work, here are some of the questions you might be asked:</p> 
 <p><em>How did the accident happen?</em></p> 
 <p><em>What was the cause of the accident?</em></p> 
 <p><em>Were there any injuries? </em>And:</p> 
 <p><em>How could the accident have been avoided?</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>So luckily for Anna she might get out of that date with Tom!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Hey Tom, don't look so glum. I'm up for dinner if you still are?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Ouch… really?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Sure Tom, and as you've only got one arm now, you won't be hugging me all the time.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>You'll have to spoon feed him his food too!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Denise, could you go and call pest control please?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Careful what you say Denise, or you may get injured too! So it looks Anna and Tom's dinner date is on – I can't wait to be a fly-on-the-wall! See you again soon. Bye!</p>

"<p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Could I have a word Anna, in my office?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Hello again. I wonder what Paul wants to say to Anna? Could it have something to do with Rachel, the pen thief - or is it just to do with biscuits?! Let's find out. &nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Have a seat… so well done for speaking to her. Stealing all those pens from the office was the final straw.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>She was stealing straws?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>No, no. It was the final thing that she did wrong – and it meant disciplinary action. I've had to 'let her go' – in other words, sack her.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh, so she's gone. But what is Mr Socrates going to say? She was his best employee.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Leave it with me. I’m sure he'll understand…I hope. Now, I wanted to speak to you about your appraisal.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>My appraisal?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Yes, we do it every year. It's a chance to talk about you, talk about the highs and lows of the past year and look forward.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Highs and lows? But I haven't been walking up any hills.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>No Anna! He means your appraisal is about reviewing your performance and setting objectives for the year ahead.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>I see. But what are objectives?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>These are tasks for you to do, to try and improve your performance and skills and help the business. Here are the questions you’re likely to hear in an appraisal: <br /><em>What's gone well for you this year?<br /></em><em>What didn't go so well?<br /></em><em>What should you do more of?<br /></em><em>Let's look ahead and set some objectives.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Right. Thanks. So Paul, when shall we have this, err, appraisal?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>If you've time, we could make a start now?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh OK. So I need to think about my performance first?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Exactly. What has gone well for you this year?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Well I guess I've just done my job.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Anna! This is your chance to sell yourself. Think about the deals you've made, the people you've managed, that sort of thing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Right. Well, I did complete two big contracts for the Imperial Lemon…</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>You've had plenty of compliments for that. You seem to have a zest for selling!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Err, right… and then there was dealing with Mr Ingle in the warehouse.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Yes, that's a good example of dealing with difficult staff. And what didn't go so well?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Well… erm… working with Rachel… and cold calling I suppose. That wasn’t easy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Ah yes. But you soon warmed up! And what should you do more of?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Err, erm…</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>It's a tricky question Anna – but don't be ashamed about admitting things that you feel you could improve on. Nobody's perfect! Think about skills you'd like to improve.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh OK. Well Paul, I guess I could… develop some ideas for new products? Continue to work on the European marketing strategy... sell more Imperial Lemons… err…</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>That's enough Anna!&nbsp; If you do all that, you'll put me out of a job!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh, I don't want to do that!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Now let's look ahead and set some objectives. Biscuit?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Biscuits as an objective? Oh I see…no thanks.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>We've all got to improve our sales targets so I'm asking all the team to make an extra ten sales deals this year.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh, ten, that’s a lot.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>It is - but I know you can do it. And you mentioned developing new products, well I'd like you to do just that – but not plastic fruit, I'd like you to develop a plastic vegetable. Potato, carrot, that sort of thing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Gosh. Well, OK.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh and one more thing. Could you help Denise sort out the stationery cupboard? It's a right mess.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Err...</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>That's a lot of objectives for Anna. She's got her work cut out for the next year. Appraisals are a good time to review your work and plan what you are going to do next. Here's a reminder of the kind of questions your manager may ask you:<br /><em>What has gone well for you this year? Give me some examples.<br /></em><em>What didn't go so well?<br /></em><em>What should you do more of?<br /></em><em>Let's look ahead and set some objectives.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>So if you could write up your appraisal and have it back to me by Friday?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Of course Paul. Thanks. See you later.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh hi Anna. Are you still on for dinner on Friday?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Yes Tom!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>What's going on?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>A mouse… a mouse! I've just seen a mouse running out of the stationery office.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Was he stealing the pens?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>It's no joke. Quick…there he goes!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Leave him to me! Oh… oww!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Tom… Tom? Are you ok?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Uh oh! What’s happened to Tom? Has he broken something? Join us next time to find out. Bye!</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Hello and welcome back to Tip Top Trading. New recruit Rachel has been making life difficult for Anna; she's been making some bad business decisions. Let's find out how Anna can save the day.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Right, we've definitely got to do something about Rachel… definitely… only, I'm a bit busy at the moment.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Sorting out your dinner date are you Tom?!&nbsp; So Anna, have you spoken to Paul about this?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Yes I have, but he didn't do anything.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Hmm, well he is your boss so I think you've got to speak to him again. Take him some biscuits, that might get his attention.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Well, I'll try</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh and keep notes so you have a record of your conversation.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Denise, you're amazing. But where have the pens gone to?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>That <span>is</span> strange – we all seem to be losing our pens. Here, use this old pencil.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Thanks.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Anna. Are you happy complaining officially about Rachel?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Not really but what else can I do? She's been spoiling all the work I've been doing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Yes she has. OK, well tell Paul the facts and tell him you want action.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>OK. Right, here goes.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Come in.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Hi Paul.&nbsp; I really need to speak to you about Rachel. She really is messing things up…Paul?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Sorry, just counting my biscuits. What were you saying? Rachel? Great girl, isn't she?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>No she's not.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Paul, she's already sent out the wrong order and now she's upset our new client. Plus, have you seen the way she dresses? I'm not happy and I think you've got to take some action.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Anna, you're on fire! But stick to the facts, don't get personal about Rachel.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Well I'm sure Mr Socrates would disagree with you. Look, if she is as bad as you say then I'll give you my permission to discipline her – give her a warning.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>What! Me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>You know what's she done wrong so tell her not to do it again…and besides, I've got an important meeting to go to… and they usually have those delicious shortbread biscuits. So …I'll leave it with you then?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>What a useless boss!&nbsp; Anna are you happy about what to do next?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Not really. What am I going to say?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It's not easy but keep calm and professional and say to Rachel, &quot;<em>you've made some serious mistakes</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>you need to consult me before you contact any of our clients</em>.&quot; Give her a verbal warning saying &quot;<em>These mistakes cannot happen again, otherwise I will have to refer the matter to someone higher</em>.&quot; This may lead to disciplinary action but it may be for the best.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh it's all very serious but I suppose I've got to do it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Good luck!</p> 
 <p><strong>Rachel&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Anna! Darling! What's wrong? I saw Paul and he said you're in a bit of a mood.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>It's not a mood Rachel. Can we talk please…now?</p> 
 <p><strong>Rachel&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Yeah sure. Let's sit here, shall we – not in that chair – that's my favourite.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Rachel, I wanted to let you know that <em>you've made some serious mistakes</em>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Rachel&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>You have really upset our new client – and you think it's ok to sell second hand plastic oranges.</p> 
 <p><strong>Rachel&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Calm down. It's business, darling.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>It's not <span>good</span> business Rachel. <em>These mistakes cannot happen again. If they do I will have to take matters higher and it could result in disciplinary action</em>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Rachel&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh! You're quite scary for a short girl.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>That was unnecessary! But well done Anna for keeping cool and calm in a difficult situation. Let's hope Rachel has got the message. Here is a reminder of the phrases you could use when giving someone a verbal warning…</p> 
 <p><em>You've made some serious mistakes.<br /></em><em>You need to consult me before you contact any of our clients.<br /></em><em>These mistakes cannot happen again otherwise I will have to refer the matter to someone higher.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Let's find out how Rachel is behaving.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Ah hello, Rachel.</p> 
 <p><strong>Rachel&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Tommy boy. Come and give me a hug. Opps!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Our pens! All our pens! You've been stealing them! Rachel!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>What's going on? I say, what are all those pens doing on the floor?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>They're from Rachel's handbag. She's been stealing them!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>What? The company's pens?Right, well, I need to see you in my office please Rachel, now…if you don't mind.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna/Tom/Denise&nbsp;<br /></strong>Gasp!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>So Rachel is the pen thief! What does this mean for her job at Tip Top Trading? Find out next time. Until then, bye!</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Hello and welcome again to English at Work, where things are a little tense. Anna is finding it hard to work with new employee, Rachel. She's told Paul, the boss, about Rachel's incompetence but he’s done nothing about it. &nbsp;</p> 
 <p>So Anna, how are you feeling today?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Frustrated. All that work I put in, getting the contract for Imperial Lemons and Rachel has sent out a load of second-hand plastic oranges!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>I guess you're going to have to call your client and sort out the mess.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>I guess so. Oh hi Tom.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Is she about? The man-eater?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>No it's all clear, she's gone out for a cappuccino.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Good good. Look I managed to call the guy she bought the second-hand oranges from, and I cancelled the order.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Phew, great!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Yeah, yeah… and last night I managed to order some Imperial Lemons and sent them to that company in France – Fruit Traders International. Here’s the paperwork.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Tom, that's brilliant! Here, let me give you a big hug – you saved the day!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Ooh, that's a bit tight.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh not again! You two just can't leave each other alone…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Bbbut it was just…</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Say no more Anna. Now, I was looking for my special red pen, have you seen it anywhere?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />No. Funny that, my pens have gone missing too.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I'll go and get some more.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Now Anna, I don't want to interfere but have you called that company in France to see how they are?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Well, they're fine aren’t they?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />It's good customer service to call them and see how they are.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />But what do I say?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Tell you what. I'll go over there and you can call me and practise.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Right. OK Tom, I'm calling your number now.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Hello – Fruit Traders International.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Yes, hello<em>…</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>…introduce yourself and ask me how I am.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh right. Hello I'm Anna from Tip Top Trading. How are you today?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>I'm very well. Now ask me about the order.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>I hope you have received our Imperial Lemons and that you are happy with the order.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Yes, very very happy. The lemons are… fantastique!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh that's good. Erm… we do hope you are pleased with our service and that you may use us again.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>We certainly will. Thank you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Do you have any questions you may want to ask?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>No… actually yes…. err, can I… err… buy you dinner sometime?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Very funny Tom. They won't ask that!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>No. I'm asking you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh right… erm… OK then… yes!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Hooray! Or should I say oh dear? Silly Anna has agreed to go on a dinner date with Tom – but there is still some business to attend to. Don't forget to make that call to your client Anna.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>No I won't – in fact I'll do it right now.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Good! While she makes that call, here is a reminder of some of the phrases she could use…</p> 
 <p><em>Hello I'm Anna from Tip Top Trading. How are you today?<br /></em><em>I hope you have received our order and are happy with it.<br /></em><em>We do hope you are pleased with our service and that you may use us again.<br /></em><em>Do you have any questions you may want to ask?</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Are you OK Anna? You look a bit annoyed.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>I am – I just called our client in France to check everything was OK and they said Rachel had already called them and told them our lemons were so last season and they would be stupid not to choose oranges!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>That's terrible.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><em>…</em>hey Anna, how about this restaurant for our date… I mean our business meeting. Look at this menu…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Not now Tom. Rachel has messed things up again. She's causing so much trouble. She's got to go.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oh… yeah right. This calls for action.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />It certainly does. It sounds like Rachel has gone too far this time and it's up to Anna to sort things out. But what can she do? Join us again next time on English at Work to find out. Bye!</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Hello. It's another busy day at the offices of Tip Top Trading…</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>And I said no John, not at my age, I'd rather take the bus…</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>…yeah Pete, that's great, so we'll deliver 2,000 bananas by Friday. Let's have a beer soon… yeah… cheers mate.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>But there are two people who are busy annoying each other…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>So you did what? You ordered the second-hand ones?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Rachel&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Chillax Hannah…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Anna!</p> 
 <p><strong>Rachel&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>…they're just oranges…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>…plastic lemons actually.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Anna is struggling to work with Rachel, Mr Socrates' favourite Sales Executive, who he's sent in to help out… or hinder more like!</p> 
 <p><strong>Rachel&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Look, I'm off for a cappuccino, everything will be just fine. Ciao.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Anna, has Rachel gone out?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Yes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>She's a bit of a man-eater. She almost ate me once.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>She eats men?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Well, not exactly. I worked with her in my last job. She was always listening in to other people's conversations and she's always changing jobs. That's why they call her Rachel Rabbit – you know, big ears, always jumping from one job to another.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Rachel Rabbit! That's funny. So she isn't that good then?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh, useless! She only worked for Mr Socrates because her father threatened to sue the company, after one of our plastic pineapples fell off a shelf and broke his toe. But, better keep that under your hat.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>My hat?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>I mean, keep it secret.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh right, I see. Well, now she's ordered loads of second-hand oranges to send to our new customer in France.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>But they wanted Imperial Lemons?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>I know. I'm not sure what to do, so I'm going to have to speak to Paul about this.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Yes it's a good idea to refer up sometimes – ask the boss for advice. Say to him &quot;I'm concerned that Rachel has made a mistake that might affect the business&quot;. You might also say &quot;she's not pulling her weight&quot;, meaning she's not doing the work she is supposed to do. And you could say &quot;I'm finding it very difficult to work with this person.&quot;</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Right. I'll try. There's Paul now… Paul, could I have a word please?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Of course, Anna. Let's go in my office. Now, how can I help?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Err, well, it's Rachel.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Yes, amazing woman. Mr Socrates' favourite.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>I know… but <em>I'm finding it difficult to work with her.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Paul&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh why's that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong><em>I'm a bit concerned that she's made a mistake and it might affect our business.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Paul&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Golly gosh. Really?! Why's that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Well, she's ordered second-hand oranges for our new client in France.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>That's marvellous… isn't it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Well, I asked her not to. They wanted lemons… new Imperial Lemons.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Ah… not so marvellous. Anything else?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Well, speaking personally, <em>I don't think she's pulling her weight.</em> She doesn't seem to do any work and just keeps going out to buy cappuccinos.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Well, that's just not on. Look Anna, I will look into this straight away and see if I can sort this out. Thank you for bringing it to my attention. Now, I think you've earned a custard cream.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>So Anna has expressed her concerns to Paul, the boss. It's up to him to investigate. As long as you have a fair reason to complain about a difficult member of staff, these are some of the phrases you could use:<em>&nbsp;</em></p> 
 <p><em>I'm concerned that she's made a mistake that might affect the business.<br /></em><em>She's not pulling her weight.<br /></em><em>I'm finding it very difficult to work with her.</em></p> 
 <p>I wonder how Paul is going to handle the situation?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Ah, there you are Rachel. Nice cappuccino? Could you step in to my office for a moment… I'd like a word.</p> 
 <p><strong>Rachel</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Ya, sure.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Ooh, I wonder what that's all about. Do you know Anna?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Hmm, no idea.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />She's probably going to get a promotion and a pay rise… and a custard cream!</p> 
 <p><strong>Rachel</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Thanks Paul, ciao. What a great guy he is. Such a great sense of humour! Looks like we're doing some good work Anna!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Wwwhat?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Oh Anna. I'm not sure Paul has really sorted out your concerns. But don't worry, we're here to help you out. See you next time on English at Work. Bye!</p>

 <p><strong>Denise</strong><br />Typical! Well, she's coming up in the lift with Paul now.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna&nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh, so who is she?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>It's Rachel. Do you remember? She’s the woman who Mr Socrates recommended. He says she's brilliant and <em>allegedly</em> one of his best employees… oh, here she comes now.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>…and this is our office. Ah, Anna, there you are. Did I mention before you went to France, that Rachel is joining us for a while?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />No.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong><br />Ah… well… here she is. This is Rachel.</p> 
 <p><strong>Rachel &nbsp;<br /></strong>Hi!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Hi. I'm Anna. I work here as a sales executive.</p> 
 <p><strong>Rachel<br /></strong>I know. You're quite new aren't you, ya?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Not that new. She's just won a great contract for us. Anyway, looks like you two are going to get on like a house on fire. Anna, I'd like you to, sort of, work alongside Rachel.</p> 
 <p><strong>Rachel<br /></strong>Alongside? Shouldn't I be in charge?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Yes… it's just, you know, you're not familiar with our office and Anna is, sort of, across this new contract… so… if you don’t mind?</p> 
 <p><strong>Rachel&nbsp;<br /></strong>OK. Just for now, but don't think I’m going to be told what to do.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>I'm sure you won't be Rachel but maybe we could help each other?</p> 
 <p><strong>Rachel &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>I'll try.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Good! Oh dear. This is awkward. I've never worked with anyone like <em>this</em> before.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator &nbsp;<br /></strong>Well, now's your chance Anna. Rachel may be awkward to manage but try these phrases which may help things go more smoothly. Say, &quot;I understand you have lots of experience so I would like to use your skills to help with the task.&quot; And, &quot;Together we can do this job really well.&quot; But why not just start by making her a cup of tea. Good luck!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh thanks. Rachel, would you like a cup of tea? And then we could talk about this contract.</p> 
 <p><strong>Rachel &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>I don't drink tea. Let's just get down to business.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh, right.</p> 
 <p><strong>Rachel &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Now, I think you need to check your stock and make sure you've got your oranges.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Err… It's lemons actually.</p> 
 <p><strong>Rachel<br /></strong>Whatever. Just get them and… you know… put them in a… thingy… a box.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Well, actually… I understand you have lots of experience so maybe we could you use your skills for this task?</p> 
 <p><strong>Rachel &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Well, it's true, I do have lots of experience. Thanks for recognising that.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>So maybe… we could work on this job… together?</p> 
 <p><strong>Rachel &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh ya, sure. Great. Of course. I can get hold of these oranges… err… lemons, pronto. I know a man who can get some second-hand ones, it'll save us loads of money.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>But what about the quality?</p> 
 <p><strong>Rachel<br /></strong>Quality?! It's the cost we've got to worry about. Keep up Hannah.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Anna.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Come on Anna. Don't let her boss you around. It's time to stand your ground. If she causes trouble say &quot;let's discuss this so we can agree on a plan of action&quot; or &quot;please respect my decision and let’s move on.&quot;</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp;<br /></strong>Hmm, OK, I'll give it a try. Rachel, I like your enthusiasm but… can we discuss this so we can agree on a plan of action?</p> 
 <p><strong>Rachel<br /></strong>Of course. Why didn't you say? Come on discuss… discuss… talk!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Well, we pride ourselves on quality products and our Imperial Lemon is particularly good… and I think our client is expecting that. So I would like to send them what I had promised in the contract.</p> 
 <p><strong>Rachel<br /></strong>Oh ya, I see. But I'm not really sure you're right.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Well, if you could just respect my decision this time and we can move on?</p> 
 <p><strong>Rachel<br /></strong>Well, just this once Hannah. But I think I'm going to have to talk to Mr Socrates about you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well done Anna for standing your ground. It can sometimes be tricky working with a new member of staff, but it's important to try and develop a good working relationship – remember business comes first! Let's hear those phrases again:</p> 
 <p><em>I understand you have lots of experience, so I would like to use your skills to help with the task.<br /></em><em>Together we can do this job really well.<br /></em><em>Let's discuss this so we can agree on a plan of action.<br /></em><em>Please respect my decision and let's move on.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Hi Anna. Can't believe we were in France this time yesterday.</p> 
 <p><strong>Rachel<br /></strong>Oh hello, Tommy boy. Long time no see! This <span>is</span> a nice surprise.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Err… mmmm…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Have you two met before?</p> 
 <p><strong>Rachel &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>We certainly have. Hey Tommy boy?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh no!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Ha ha. Looks like Tom is lost for words – let's hope he finds them in time for the next episode of English at Work. Bye!</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Welcome back to English at Work, where Anna and Tom are in a bit of a predicament. Following a successful business meeting, they've returned to the airport to discover their flight has been cancelled. What are they going to do next?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Right, they've rebooked us on to the next flight, which is at 7 o'clock tomorrow morning.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Tomorrow morning?! What are we going to do until then?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>It's OK Anna, calm down. I've sorted out a hotel… quite a nice one actually.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>But what about our new contract? I've got to sort it out!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Anna, take a deep breath… it'll be ok. Let's go and get a drink and we'll work things out.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Anna, maybe Tom's right for once. Go and enjoy some French hospitality. You've done really well today but perhaps you should keep your boss Paul in the picture.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>In the picture? I didn't take any photos.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />No Anna! I mean keep him informed. It's always a good idea to keep the boss updated on what's going on – he is the boss after all.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />OK. I will.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Yeah, this one looks quite cosy. I'll order us a beer shall I?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>I'd prefer an orange juice please.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh really? OK then. Err, Garcon. Je m'appelle un beer et citron juice thing. Au revoir!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>What?! No Tom! Pardon, Je voudrais une grande biere et du juice d'orange s'il vous plait.</p> 
 <p><strong>Waiter &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Oui Madame.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>I think she likes you! Well, everyone likes you Anna. I like you because…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>I like you too Tom but don't you think I should call Paul and update him on what's going on… keep him in the picture?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>I dunno. Let's just enjoy this moment shall we? And besides, he'll be at his biscuit appreciation class by now.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>No. I would be happier just to call him. Could I borrow your mobile phone please? My battery has run out.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Yeah sure. You'll find his number under <em>Attila the Hun</em>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Attila the Hun?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Just my little joke!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Cheeky! But hold on… what am I going to say to him?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Well, don't call him Attila the Hun! Think before you call him: <em>It's good news – you've closed the deal and the contract is signed. We need to proceed with the order as quickly as possible</em>. And say, <em>I'm committed to getting the order delivered on time.</em> But if you need help, ask for it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>OK I will. It's ringing…</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Hello?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Hi Paul. It's Anna. I've got some good news!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Hold on.&nbsp;Sorry, I'm just munching some new crumbly cream biscuits. Now, what's the good news? Is it about the contract?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Yes! I've closed the deal with Fruit Traders International and the contract is signed.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Excellent news.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>To keep them happy, we need to proceed with the order as quickly as possible.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Of course, of course. So what are you planning to do?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Well, obviously, I'm committed to getting the order delivered on time but I might need some help. I wonder if Tom could…</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Yes, Tom can help you. Denise tells me you have a… special chemistry! Actually, where is Tom now? Is he home yet?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>He's not. Actually Paul, Tom and I are going to stay in a hotel tonight… Hello? Hello? Oh, I've lost the signal, he's gone.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Never mind Anna. I think he got the message. Another drink?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Let's hope Paul has got the<em> right</em> message about Anna and Tom! Anyway, she's briefed the boss and kept him in the picture. Here's a reminder of some of the phrases she used:</p> 
 <p><em>It's good news – I've closed the deal and the contract is signed.<br /></em><em>We need to proceed with the order as quickly as possible.<br /></em><em>I'm committed to getting the order delivered on time… but I will need some help.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />A good day's work for Anna but now it's time for bed.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Right, well, it's time for bed. We've got an early start tomorrow.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />So, where are we staying?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />A lovely little boutique hotel, just round the corner. I've booked a room with a view.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />A room? One room?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Err yeah. That's all they had, actually… honest!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Hmm. This could be interesting. Let's hope things remain professional.&nbsp; Until next time. Bye!</p>

"<p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Tom, could you let go of my hand?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Sorry, it's just I get nervous flying.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Well, we've landed in Marseille now so you're safe… oh, I like your passport photo.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh do you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>I didn't know your middle name was Stanley.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>After my great-great-grandfather.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Really? Come on we need to get a taxi. Taxi! Taxi!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Hello again. Anna and Tom are on a very important business trip to try and sign a deal to sell their plastic fruit to a company in France. The company has received a better offer so Anna needs to convince them that Tip Top Trading's lemons are best. Are you feeling confident Anna?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Not really. It was OK speaking to them on the phone but seeing them face-to-face is quite scary.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />You'll be fine. Stay calm. They'll be pleased you've taken the time to fly out and see them – but tell them you're grateful for their time and recap what you told them on the phone.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Oh yes – beat the price of the competitor but get them to make a bigger order.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Yes. If they order more you can offer a bigger discount. Good luck.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oh look, we're here now. Now Anna, I hope you don't mind me saying, but just leave the talking to me. Right?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Err, well…</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oh, Madame Brown, ciao, great to see you</p> 
 <p><strong>Trader</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />What?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Monsieur Brown. Bonjour. I'm Anna from Tip Top Trading. This is my colleague Tom. Thank you for sparing the time to see us.</p> 
 <p><strong>Trader</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />No problem. Did you have a good flight?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It was great. I love those little bottles of wine they give out… I kept a few with me if you fancy a glass of vin rouge?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />I think we should sit down and discuss business.</p> 
 <p><strong>Trader</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Of course.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Yeah, yeah, good idea.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Now, I believe Tutti Fruity has offered you a good price but as I said on the phone, we can beat that.</p> 
 <p><strong>Trader</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Yes you did.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Did you Anna?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />But to get this price you've got to buy lots more.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Anna! That's not very subtle. You need to convince them they need to buy more without telling them they have to.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />What she means is our Imperial Lemons are made with our unique laser curve technology. They are hard wearing and a joy to have on display in any shop window or restaurant.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Tom, that's amazing!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />I read it on the back of the box!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />So, we really feel that we have a product that you'll be proud to display. And to get this fantastic price you just need to place an order of 10,000.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />And we can even throw in a free sample of our new Perfect Peach range.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Each lemon comes with a satisfaction guarantee. I know you won't be disappointed.</p> 
 <p><strong>Trader</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Hmm. It sounds good. OK, I think you have a deal.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Good work Anna. Don't forget to ask him to sign the contract and tell him when he can expect the order to be delivered.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />OK. I would be grateful if you could just sign the contract. We'll get the lemons to you as quickly as we can. Tom, do you have a pen?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Erm, no actually. It was in my bag yesterday but it's gone… it was a nice, a good one too.</p> 
 <p><strong>Trader</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />No problem. I have a pen. There you go.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Thank you. It was a pleasure doing business with you. We'll get those lemons to you in two weeks' time.</p> 
 <p><strong>Trader</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Perfect!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Good work Anna…oh and Tom too. The contract is signed but now you have to deliver what you've promised. There are many ways to clinch a deal; here are some of the phrases Anna used…</p> 
 <p><em>Thank you for sparing the time to see us.<br /></em><em>Each lemon comes with a satisfaction guarantee - I know you won't be disappointed.<br /></em><em>I would be grateful if you could just sign the contract.<br /></em><em>Thank you. It was a pleasure doing business with you.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />So it's been a successful day. It's time for Tom and Anna to fly back to London and tell Paul the good news… or is it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Oh no look, our flight to London is cancelled! It's the last one today. What are we going to do?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Well, I guess we're just going to have to stay here for the night. I'll sort out a hotel.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Until next time. Bye!</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Hello again. Well, this is very exciting! Paul, the boss, is sending Anna and Tom on a business trip to France. He wants them to clinch the deal with a company interested in buying their Imperial Lemons. But has Tom got more than business on his mind?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Really? What… me and Anna… to France?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Yes but make sure you get that contract signed. We need the business.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Yeah, yeah, of course. Are we staying overnight?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />There's no money for that – just get there and come straight back. Oh and could you bring back those nice French biscuits that have in the duty-free shop?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Sure. So, Anna, we're off on holiday together are we?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />No! But I've got to book the flights online, can you help me please?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It's not my thing. I'm sure Denise will help. I need to go and pack for this trip.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Yes Marge… in the cupboard… envelopes apparently… Tom and Anna… oh here she is… got to go Marge… bye. Hello Anna, everything OK?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Sort of. I've got to go to France with Tom.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Yes, I know. I thought you'd be pleased to go with Tom, after your time in the stationery cupboard with him!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />I was just finding an envelope Denise. Anyway, I'm worried about booking the flights online. I usually book flights at a travel agent's.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It's company policy now, we have to do everything online – even my food shopping – but don’t tell Paul.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oh right. So where shall I begin?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Pull up a chair Anna and we'll log on. Right let's start with the British Airlines website. There. London to Marseille. What is the outbound date?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Going out tomorrow, back tomorrow.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Business class or Economy class? I think we'll say Economy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />That's cheaper I guess. What's this mean? Flexible or fixed?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />A flexible ticket means you can change your flight but a fixed one means you can't – and that's cheaper so we'll choose that one. I'll book you on the 8am flight from Heathrow and flying home at 6pm. I just need to type in your full names now and select your seats. Window or aisle?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />I'll what?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />No Anna. A seat by the aisle or by the window?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Oh, an aisle seat please, Denise.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Good. What's your frequent flyer number?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oh I don't have one of those.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />What's that? Frequent flyer number? Here I've got a gold status card, can you stick my number in?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Gold status! Where did you get that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oh, I've flown loads of times for business. I've done deals all around the world.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />He means he's been on lots of jollies – free trips paid for by the company – and all he's come home with is a sun tan!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Hmm, really. Right I just need to pay now… using the company account of course.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Cool. Now, what do you think of my sunglasses?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Lovely Tom. Denise has booked you a window seat OK?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />No! Sorry I can't sit by the window… I’m… errr…</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Yes Tom?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Well, I mean, it's only polite that the lady sits by the window.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Really?!</p> 
 <p><strong><span>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></span></strong>What's Tom like?! Hopefully he'll prove a useful business partner for Anna on the trip to France. Here's a reminder of some of the questions you may be asked when booking a flight…</p> 
 <p><em>What's the outbound and return date?<br /></em><em>Do you want to fly business or economy?<br /></em><em>Do you want a fixed or flexible ticket?<br /></em><em>Would you like a window or aisle seat?<br /></em><em>Have you got a frequent flyer number?</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />There you go you two, your e-ticket. Now don't forget your passports.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Thanks Denise. Hey Anna, I'm so pleased that we're on this trip together. It'll be nice to spend some time with you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Yes and to do some business and really show Paul we are his best employees.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oh yeah, of course… I just wondered…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Yes?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Is there any chance I could sit in the aisle seat?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />I've got a feeling Anna's in for a bumpy ride. Find out how their trip goes next time on English at Work. See ya!</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Welcome back to Tip Top Trading where things aren't going too well. Anna negotiated a deal with a client in France but now they claim they've been ripped off! This has got to get sorted – quickly.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh Denise, what exactly did they say?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Something about them agreeing a price for 5,000 lemons and then being offered a better price by another company.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>That'll be Tutti Fruity – they want our business.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Sounds like they're going to get it, unless you sort it out. Maybe you should work out some new figures.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Figures? Is there something wrong with my figure – am I too fat?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>No Anna! Your numbers – work out a new price, see if you can squeeze the price of lemons – maybe you can price Tutti Fruity out of the market.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Hmm, somebody else has said that.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Yes it was me Anna! Do your calculations, see if you can offer a better deal and price Tutti Fruity out of the market.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />OK. I could sell them cheaper but there would be less profit.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Well, less profit is better than no profit. And who knows, if this goes well, it might lead to more contracts. But it's down to you now to make that call.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />But what am I going to say?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Be friendly and say… <em>I'm sorry to hear you're not happy with our price</em>. Tell them <em>Tip Top Trading prides itself on quality products and good value for money</em>. And flatter them and say they are <em>a valued customer and their business is very important to us.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />And what shall I say about the price?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Tell them you can match the price of our competitors.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Match the price. Right. Thanks. OK, I had better call them.</p> 
 <p><strong>Trader &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Bonjour. Fruit Traders International.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh, erm, hello, is that Monsieur Brown?</p> 
 <p><strong>Trader &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Oui. Yes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>This is Anna… from Tip Top Trading. I was sorry to receive your message.</p> 
 <p><strong>Trader &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Yes, well. I thought we were doing good business and then another company called me and offered me a much better deal.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Yes, I understand. I’m sorry to hear you're not happy with our price… but hopefully we can sort something out?</p> 
 <p><strong>Trader &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh yes?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>You are a valued customer and your business is very important to us… and we would love to see our Imperial Lemons on display in the restaurants and shops of France.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>That's a nice touch Anna, well done!</p> 
 <p><strong>Trader &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>So?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>So, I've done some calculations and we can offer you a better price.</p> 
 <p><strong>Trader &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>But Tutti Fruity can offer us a good price.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>I'm sure they can but… we… we…</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Yes Anna?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>…at Tip Top Trading we pride ourselves on quality products and good value and I think we can match Tutti Fruity's price… in fact I know we can beat it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Trader &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>I see. That's good to hear but…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>We'll give you an extra 10% discount – but obviously we would like you to make a bigger order.</p> 
 <p><strong>Trader &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh, a bigger order. I will have to have a think about this.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Yes, of course, but please let me know as soon as you can before someone else snaps up this offer. Merci. Au revoir.</p> 
 <p><strong>Trader &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Ah, merci, au revoir.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Excellent work Anna! I can see why she's got the job now. But will her sales tactics pay off? Let's remind ourselves of some of the great lines that Anna used in trying to resolve a tricky sales deal…</p> 
 <p><em>I'm sorry to hear you're not happy with our price.<br /></em><em>Tip Top Trading prides itself on quality products and good value for money. You are a valued customer and your business is very important to us.<br /></em><em>We can match the price of our competitors.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Well done Anna. It looks like you may have saved that deal.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Saved the deal? Is there a problem?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Well, Tutti Fruity has tried to undercut our price but I think I may have saved the deal we had with International Fruit Traders in France.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Yes, Anna offered a lower price for a bigger order and they're having a think about it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Crumbs. If the deal's not complete I think you need to get out to France and seal the deal. I want you and Tom to fly out there as soon as possible and do some schmoozing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oh! You and Tom hey?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />That's enough Denise! This should be fun. Find out what happens next time on English at Work. Bye.</p>

"<p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Help, help!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Help us! We're locked in.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh dear. Do you remember that Tom and Anna are locked in the stationery cupboard? What are they going to do? And what will people say when they are discovered in there? I have a feeling we're about to find out…</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Goodness, what's that? Anna is that you? And is that you Tom?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Yes, help! We're locked in.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Don't panic, I've got the key. There. How on earth…</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>…it's not how it looks Denise. We were just… erm…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>…just looking for envelopes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Really?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Yes, yes, really. The door slammed shut and locked from the inside when Tom walked in.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Yeah, she's right. Just walked in, and shut the door and bang.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Hmm. Let's just keep it our little secret shall we. (<em>Aside to Anna</em>) I thought you had better taste Anna!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Ah there you are Anna, I need a word with you… Oh, you look like you've been caught doing something you shouldn't! Ha ha.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>…but I haven't.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Just joking Anna. Now could you step in to my office, we need to touch base about the European marketing strategy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Are we playing baseball?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>No Anna! Touch base. He wants to catch up with you, probably to see how you're getting on. Go on Anna, let's see what he has to say.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh I see.&nbsp;That door doesn't lock does it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>No, I don't think so. Right Anna. Biscuit? These new peanut ones are quite nice. So how are things with the project?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Well, I've done some cold calling and have an order from a company in France.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>I see. Very impressive but have they signed on the dotted line yet?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>The dotted line?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Have they actually signed the contract yet?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Well, no, but…</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>…that's the problem. There's a rival company who's also targeting the European market called Tutti Fruity - and they'll do anything to steal our customers.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh I see.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>So, to keep our head above water, we need a clear strategy… and that's why I've put you in charge. So what shall we do?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>I've a feeling Paul hasn't a clue – that's why he wants you to come up with the ideas.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>I think you're right – but I don't know what to say.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Tell him we need to <em>price the rivals out of the market, </em>that means offer the lowest prices so nobody wants to buy plastic fruit from our rivals. You could say that we need to <em>corner the market, </em>that means Tip Top Trading dominates the plastic fruit market.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh, thanks. That's very useful.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>So Anna, any thoughts?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Lots Paul. I think we've got to compete on price.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Oh yes?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>We need to price Tutti Fruity out of the market. We need to corner the market so that everyone knows we are the best choice for good quality, good value plastic fruit.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>I like it!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>And… and…</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Tell him we need to<em> build good relationships with our customers</em> – that means we give them good service.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />…we need to build good relationships with our customers. Talk to them regularly, send them gifts… go and meet them face to face.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Face to face? Yes, great idea – just what I was thinking. If we follow this strategy I reckon there could be a bonus for us all by Christmas.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Well done Anna. Very convincing. If you can put your ideas into practice you'll save the company. Let's remind ourselves of the words you used to create the European marketing strategy…</p> 
 <p><em>We've got to compete on price.<br /></em><em>We need to price the rivals out of the market.<br /></em><em>We need to corner the market.<br /></em><em>We need to build good relationships with our customers.</em></p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Well, things seem to be going well for Anna… or are they?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Anna! Anna! That man from France has called again and left a message. He's not happy this time. Something about us trying to rip them off!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>What? Rip them off?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>It means over charging them or giving them poor quality goods.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>That's not fair. I'm going to have to sort this out.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>That's it Anna – go and build a good relationship with your customer! Bye for now.</p>

"<p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>(On the phone) Yes, we have plenty in stock. They're &pound;4 per unit… They are good quality ones…</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The company in France that Anna called earlier has called her back. Let's hope they're making an order.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>…laser technology isn't cheap… hmm, I see… Well, thanks for calling back. Bye.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Everything OK Anna?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Not really. One of the companies I cold called has rung back…</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Good, good…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>…but they don't want to place an order. They say we're too expensive.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>So you let them go? Didn't you negotiate with them?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh, was I meant to? I wasn't sure what to say.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Having trouble Anna? Don't worry, I'm sure that I can help. Negotiating is my thing!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>&quot;Negotiating is my thing&quot;! What is he like? Mind you, he has won a Pear Salesman of the Year award so he must be doing something right.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Are you sure Tom? Don't you want to negotiate your own deals?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>I owe you one Anna after you saved my bacon with Mr Socrates the other night. And besides you and me…</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Come on you two. Get a move on. Europe is waiting for us! Custard cream anyone?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>No thanks. Right. Now you need to call that French company back and ask them what kind of price they are willing to pay.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>And then say that's fine?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>No! Negotiate. Say &quot;I don't think we can go that low&quot;.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>&quot;I don't think we can go that low&quot;.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>If they want a bigger discount, tell them they will have to buy more stock.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>More stock, bigger discount.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yeah. And if you still can't agree a price, tell them &quot;I'll meet you halfway&quot;.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Meet halfway?! That means going to Paris!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>No. Halfway on the price. That line always works for me. I sold a load of plastic pears that way once.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>So that's &quot;I'll meet you halfway&quot;. Thanks Tom. I'm really impressed. You… you…</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Am I, really?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>What? I was going to say, you really do know your stuff – despite what other people say.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>What? Uh?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Right, I'm off to make that call right now.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Good luck Anna and well done Tom! Nice to hear him give some useful advice but will it work? Let's remind ourselves of the phrases he suggested Anna uses when negotiating a sale:<br />What kind of price are you willing to pay?<br />I don't think we can go that low.<br />If you buy more stock, I can offer you a bigger discount.<br />I'll meet you halfway.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Let's see how Anna has got on.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Success! They've agreed to buy 5,000 Imperial Lemons.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Brilliant. I knew you would be great. Did those killer lines of mine work?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Sort of – but when I said what price were they looking to pay, they said the full price! As long as I send them the contract today so I'd better go and get an envelope and post it as soon as I can.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh great.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Tom… Tom… can you come over here to the stationery cupboard and get an envelope from the top shelf for me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yeah, suppose so… I'm coming... (Door slams shut) …oh!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh Tom, why did you do that? It won't open… it's locked… help, help!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Help!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Uh oh. This should be interesting. How are they going to explain being locked in the stationery cupboard? Until next time. Bye!</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Bye bye Mr Socrates. He’s flying back to America leaving Tip Top Trading’s London team trying to work out how best to focus their business on the European market.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Sorry to keep you waiting. I had to go to the airport with Mr Socrates to see him off. We had a good chat in the taxi and he said some very positive things.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Oh yes. Like what?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Err, well… well, how nice English beer is.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yeah but what about the European marketing strategy – what are we going to do about that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Well, Anna is supposed to lead on that, I’m taking a more biscuitorial control over it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>A what?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>It means you do all the work while he eats all the biscuits!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Do you mind Tom. Now, what I’m thinking is we put the feelers out – do some cold calling, see what people are buying at the moment.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Cold calling? But I like to be warm when I’m on the phone.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>No Anna. Cold calling is when you call prospective clients when they’re not expecting you to, to ask them something or to sell them something. I’m very good at calling people.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yeah, usually the hair dresser! So Paul, where do we begin, who do we call first?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Track down some potential clients in Europe, see what they’re buying now, see what they want in the future. Make them think it’s our laser-curved fruit they want!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>But keep your calls brief, international calls are very expensive.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>OK Anna, it’s time to cold call. What are you going to say?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I don’t know.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Find someone to call, then be pleasant and polite. When you call, ask to speak to the person who deals with buying or purchasing. And then ask that person if they could spare a few minutes of their time.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>OK. Here goes. (Looking through a telephone directory) Let’s have a look… fruit growers, fruit pickers, fruit traders… Fruit Traders International… (Dials number) 0-0-4-3-9-8-4-5-5-4-4.</p> 
 <p><strong>Trader<br /></strong>Bonjour?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>(surprised) Ah, erm, oh….</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Don’t be surprised! You’ve called a company in France, they speak French. Just ask if it’s OK to speak English.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh hello. Is it possible to speak to you in English?</p> 
 <p><strong>Trader<br /></strong>Oui… yes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Great. Are you the person who purchases plastic fruit for your company?</p> 
 <p><strong>Trader<br /></strong>I am. How can I help you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes, can you spare a few minutes of your time? I want to sell you some laser-curved fruit.</p> 
 <p><strong>Trader<br /></strong>What?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>That’s a bit direct Anna. Slow down and tell them your name and why you’re calling. Find out something about them. Maybe say “I’d like to tell you about our great new laser-curved fruit”. Ask them “How much plastic fruit do you buy?” and at the end of the call say “thank you for your time. We hope to hear from you soon.” Give it a go Anna.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>OK. Erm… hello my name is Anna. How are you today?</p> 
 <p><strong>Trader<br /></strong>Good thank you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>That’s good. I’d like to tell you about our great new laser-curved fruit.</p> 
 <p><strong>Trader<br /></strong>Oh yes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Our company is called Tip Top Trading and we are the UK’s number 1 plastic fruit manufacturer – and well, we’re so proud of our fruit that we’ve decided to let the rest of Europe enjoy it too.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Very good Anna!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>We make our fruit using laser-curved technology. In fact we’ve just launched our best product ever, the Imperial Lemon – it looks so real you want to squeeze it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Trader<br /></strong>Hmm, lemons, interesting.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Anna’s got the hang of this – she’s on fire – I mean, she’s doing really well. Her cold calling technique has really warmed up. She’s pitched the products now she needs to sell.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>…so thank you for your time. I hope you may consider us when you next purchase some plastic fruit.</p> 
 <p><strong>Trader<br /></strong>We will certainly consider your company.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Well we hope to hear from you soon. Goodbye (puts phone down). Tom, Tom, how are you getting on?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>(On phone/angry) …well if that’s what you think then you can shove your kumquats… hello? Hello? (Slams phone down)</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>What’s wrong?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>They’ve hung up on me. Really! He said the plastic fruit industry is in meltdown. But Anna, if I don’t get any contracts soon I’ll be fired.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Well, this calls for teamwork Tom – tomorrow, Tuesday, we’re going to tackle this task – together!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hooray for Anna. Now she’s sounding like a leader. And she’s mastered cold calling by using some simple phrases, like these:<br />My name is Anna. Can you spare a few minutes of your time?<br />I’d like to tell you about our great new laser-curved fruit<br />How much plastic fruit do you buy?<br />Thank you for your time. We hope to hear from you soon.<br />Phone rings</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Anna. There’s a call for you, from someone in France, they want to talk to you about lemons.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Sounds promising. Find out what happens next time on English at Work. Bye.</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello again. Tip Top Trading’s big boss, Mr Socrates has announced a new strategy to sell plastic fruit to Europe and hopefully keep the company afloat. But before the real work begins it’s time for him to enjoy some good English hospitality at the pub, courtesy of the team from the London office. Let’s join them now…</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>…Well welcome to the Rose and Crown, it is small, not like one of those bars you get in your country. Can I get you a pint Mr Socrates?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>A what?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>A pint. A pint of beer, it’s really nice here if you like it…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>I don’t drink. Just an orange juice, freshly squeezed.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>On go on Mr Socrates, one pint won’t hurt. You’ve got to have a pint of beer when you come to a pub.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>Oh very well. I’ll try one. It had better be good.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>You’ll love it. I’ll get it. Three pints of your best beer please Mr Landlord. Denise, are you OK getting your own? I’m a bit short of cash.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Oh… right. Mr Socrates, Anna said she would be along soon. She had some work to finish. She’s such a hard worker.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>Good to hear. She seems like a smart cookie. Now let’s try this beer …mmm, not bad, a little warm but… tasty.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Oh, you drank that quickly… would you like another one?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>Sure.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Hi everyone. Sorry I’m late.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Hi Anna. Look Mr Socrates is enjoying our English beer. I think it’s going to his head.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>(Loudly) Anna! Our best worker. Get Anna a drink.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yes Mr Socrates. Of course Mr Socrates.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>Anna, come over here, let’s talk.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh right. What about…</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>There you go Anna. I got you some crisps too. So what are we talking about?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>Nothing. Thank you… bye bye.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh right. Bye bye. Yes, I’ll go and talk to Paul and Denise. I’ll just be over here.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>What a loser. I can tell he’s all talk and no action.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Well, Tom’s a good worker really and…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>…and as for Paul. God, what a manager. Always eating cookies. You know he was fired from his last job because…</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Anna, I think he’s getting a bit too personal. That beer is making him say things he shouldn’t.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I know. What should I say?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Try saying “it’s not appropriate to talk like that” or “could we change the subject please.”</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>OK thanks. Erm, Mr Socrates I don’t think it’s appropriate to talk like that, could we change the subject please?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>Oh, sorry have I said too much? Maybe we should talk about you. I like you Anna. You’re keen but you’ve got a lot to learn and I think you should wear more black – it makes you look… thinner…</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>He’s out of order. I think he’s saying too much. Ask him to keep the conversation professional.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Right, good idea. (To Mr Socrates) Erm, Mr Socrates, thank you but can we keep our conversation professional. There’s a lot to discuss about our European market strategy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>Yeah, right, absolutely right. Anyway, you’re gonna have to lead this one not that Tom guy. I’m thinking of firing him, his results ain't that great and…</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>…sorry to interrupt, just wondered if you’d like some nuts?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>Hey Tom, I was just saying to Anna your results haven’t been good and I’m thinking of…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>(flustered)… of having another drink… thinking of having another drink. Mr Socrates, did you know Tom actually has a great idea for selling laser-curved oranges to Spain?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>(puzzled) Do I?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>That’s good to hear Tom. Email them to me and I’ll check them over tomorrow.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Of course he will, Mr Socrates. Now how would you like to drink something, errr, less strong? Orange juice perhaps?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>Na, I think I’ll try some more of the English beer.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>I&nbsp;think Anna has just done Tom a big favour – she’s stopped him getting fired - for now. Sometimes conversations with your boss can get too personal but I think Anna’s got the hang of keeping things professional. Here’s a reminder of what she said:<br /><br />It’s not appropriate to talk like that.<br />Could we change the subject please?<br />Can we keep our conversation professional please?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>So Anna seems to be Mr Socrates’s favourite team member but now she’s got some explaining to do to Tom.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Anna, what were you talking about to Mr Socrates? “Ideas for selling laser-curved oranges to Spain”?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>He was going to fire you – so I was trying to tell him you had great ideas.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>What?! You helped me? Anna, I don’t know what to say. I… I… I…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>I… need to go back to the office to work on some ideas.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Good idea. Keep it professional, eh Tom? Until next time. Bye!</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello again. It’s the big day and Mr Socrates is about to arrive at the offices of Tip Top Trading to talk officially to the team. What is he going to say? And more importantly, will he get his freshly squeezed orange juice?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Quickly everybody… he’s coming out of the lift with Paul.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Anna quickly, get a glass of orange juice ready.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>…and if we come through this door here we get to the office and… morning everyone. I’m sure we’ve all met Mr Socrates on the day of the… fire… but today everything is a bit calmer and well he’s here to say hello.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr S<br /></strong>Hi!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Biscuit Mr Socrates?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr S<br /></strong>Biscuit? You mean a goddamn cookie. Thanks.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Err, Mr Socrates, I’m Anna. Would you like some orange juice – freshly squeezed?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr S<br /></strong>You betcha as long as it’s made from Florida oranges. Hey… Anna? Ain’t you the girl who booked my hotel room?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh yes, sorry about the bed and…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr S<br /></strong>Hey, you got me a new room, it was great. You did a good job there. Well done.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh thanks.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Hello. It’s Tom. I recommended the hotel, it was a…</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Tom. Everyone, shall we gather round and hear what Mr Socrates has to say? Please.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr S<br /></strong>Hey… errr, what’s your name…</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Paul.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr S<br /></strong>Yeah you. Don’t you think I should be sitting in the big chair?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Sorry. Yes of course. (Shuffling) There you go.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr S<br /></strong>Now. Tip Top Trading. I gotta give it to you straight. Things ain’t looking good, in fact the outlook is gloomy. The global recession has led to a meltdown in the plastic fruits sector. And I’ve got to announce a profit warning. We just ain’t selling enough of these bananas, oranges and lemons to make any money.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>There’s a bit of an economic squeeze on lemons!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr S<br /></strong>What?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>(To herself) Oh dear. I’m not sure what he’s talking about but it sounds bad.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>It is Anna. He’s delivering some bad news without hiding the truth. That’s why he said “I’ve got to give it to you straight”. He said “the outlook is gloomy” which it means the future doesn’t look good. And he mentioned a “profit warning”, which means company profits are probably going to go down.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Crikey! That is bad. What does it mean?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Just keep listening for now.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr S<br /></strong>…so, this calls for action. I’m going to have to…</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>(interrupts) Oh no, not me Mr Socrates, I’ve been a loyal employee, I couldn’t face being unemployed.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Tom, calm down.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr</strong> <strong>S<br /></strong>I’m not talking about redundancies yet.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Gosh, well that calls for another biscuit.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr S<br /></strong>My plan is… we’re going into Europe.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>You mean we’re moving to Europe?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>No, no Anna. I think he means we’re going to sell plastic fruit to the European market.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh right! Great. Mr Socrates, I’ve lots of experience with Europe. I had a holiday in Spain once… twice actually.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Well we’ll have to make sure our phones can make international calls.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr S<br /></strong>Hmm. I think you’re gonna need some help with this, so I’m bringing in my best marketing executive, Rachel. What she doesn’t know about selling to Europe, you don’t wanna know. She’ll be here in a few weeks’ time.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Do you know if she prefers tea or coffee… or orange juice perhaps?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr S<br /></strong>Look Diana…</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Denise…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr S<br /></strong>Denise. Like Dennis right? She’ll want the best – the best tea, coffee, the best team. I’ll expect improved results and profits. If not your necks will be on the line – especially yours Paul.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>(nervously) Oh, chop chop. We’d better get to work.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>scary! “Your necks will be on the line” – he means their jobs will be at risk if things don’t improve. It’s a worrying time for Tip Top Trading. Let’s remind ourselves of the phrases Mr Socrates used to deliver bad news:<br />I’ve got to give it to you straight<br />The outlook is gloomy<br />I’ve got to announce a profit warning<br />Let’s hope this new marketing strategy for Europe is going to work. How are you feeling Anna?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>A little nervous. But I’m going to try my best to make sure this new strategy works.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>That’s the spirit Anna!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Right everyone. I think we need to take Mr Socrates down to the Rose and Crown after work for a pint or two and show him some true English hospitality. How about it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr</strong> <strong>S<br /></strong>I don’t drink.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Ah well, perhaps some lemonade?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Oh dear. This should be interesting. Until next time, bye!</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Welcome back to Tip Top Trading where everyone seems a bit flustered.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>…and we really need the best biscuits there are.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Yes, and I’ve made sure there’s tea and coffee…</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>…and the carpets?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Uh?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>…have they been cleaned.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Don’t panic Paul, all taken care of.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>You see, the big boss from America, Mr Socrates, is in town and everything must be just right. What’s he like Anna?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Well, so far he seems OK. A bit bossy, quite short and… a bit smelly!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well, he did just fly in from the States. But you booked him into a good hotel so hopefully he’s had a chance to clean up.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I hope so! Oh, I had better get that. Hello? Ah hello Mr Socrates, did you sleep well? Oh! I see… I see… erm… well… oh, I don’t know… Tom said it was five-star… well… OK… goodb- Oh, he’s hung up.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Everything OK Anna? You look a bit pale.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>It was Mr Socrates. He’s not happy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Golly gosh, oh dear. What’s the matter?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>It’s his hotel room. He doesn’t like it. The bed’s too soft, too small and it’s a single room not a twin room.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Oh yes, he likes to have two beds in the room for some reason.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>But Tom said he only likes a single bed in the room.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Really? Oh no, he insists on a twin – something to do with business partners he says. Anything else?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes. He says he wanted freshly squeezed orange juice for breakfast, not the stuff out of a carton.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Anything else?! A view of Mount Everest perhaps?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Yes, thank you Denise. Well, we really must sort this out. We can’t afford to upset Mr Socrates. Now Anna, you chose this hotel, I really think you need to sort out this mess.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>It was Tom’s suggestion…</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Just sort it, quickly. Oh golly gosh, golly gosh.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Uh oh Anna. Time to do some complaining. What are you going to say?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh... I don’t know. I’m not very good at complaining.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well, Anna. Keep your cool and politely tell the hotel why you’re not happy. You could say:<br />I’m very disappointed with your service.<br />The standard of service is not good enough.<br />The room I booked did not meet my expectations<br />Good luck Anna!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>OK. Here goes.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Receptionist<br /></strong>Hello. Royal Imperial Hotel.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Erm... hello… I want to… I want to complain.</p> 
 <p><strong>Receptionist<br /></strong>Really? About what exactly?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Your hotel… Well, I mean, a room I booked for my boss. Room 101. I’m very disappointed with your service.</p> 
 <p><strong>Receptionist<br /></strong>And why’s that then?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Well, the room isn’t like the one I booked. It’s just not good enough.</p> 
 <p><strong>Receptionist<br /></strong>Hmm. Let’s have a look at the booking… well your boss got a bed… and breakfast too… a continental breakfast in fact.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>But the room just didn’t meet his expectations… hello?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Give me the phone Anna, I’ll deal with this. Now hello Miss…?</p> 
 <p><strong>Receptionist<br /></strong>Miss Fit.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Miss Fit? This is the office assis- I mean Manager here. This isn’t good enough. My colleague has made it quite clear that the room did not meet our requirements and I would like you to resolve this matter as quickly as possible or I will have to cancel our reservation.</p> 
 <p><strong>Receptionist<br /></strong>Sadly, we have no other twin rooms available and anyway…</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Alright, I’d like to speak to your manager please. Really!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Good old Denise. I can tell she’s done this before but will talking to the manager really sort things out? Let’s remind ourselves of some of the phrases you can use when you need to complain:<br />I’m very disappointed with your service.<br />The standard of service is not good enough.<br />The room I booked did not meet my expectations.<br />And to get things sorted you could say:<br />I would like this matter resolved as quickly as possible.<br />Or:<br />I would like to cancel my reservation and get a full refund.<br />Let’s see if Denise has sorted things out?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>So have you managed to sort out Mr Socrates?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Oh yes, Anna’s got him a new room.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Thanks Anna, I’ll let him know. And what about the orange juice?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Errr…</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Freshly squeezed, every morning!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Oh golly gosh, that reminds me, we need some here in the office. He’s going to be here any minute and he says he’s got some important news for us.</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello again. Things haven't been going well at Tip Top Trading. There was a fire in the warehouse, caused by Mr Ingle's cigarette and now Mr Socrates – the big boss from America – has turned up unexpectedly.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr S<br /></strong>So honey, are you…?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Anna. I'm Anna, I work here as a sales executive. We haven't met before.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr S<br /></strong>We sure ain't. Looks like I've arrived just in the nick of time.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>(Out of breath)… what's going on… oh, Mr Socrates! Golly gosh, what an unexpected...</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr S<br /></strong>Unexpected alright. Looks like this company is in a mess.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Err yes. It was OK when I popped out for some biscuits… erm, would you like one?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr S<br /></strong>Biscuits?! They're cookies man. Look, now what do I have to do to get a triple-shot, organic, skinny cappuccino round here?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I'll get you one Mr Socrates.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr S<br /></strong>It's OK honey. I need you to book me a hotel room. You... what's your name again…Paul… can you fetch me one?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Right Anna. Booking a room for Mr Socrates. This is something you can't get wrong.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Well I've never done it before.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>I'm sure you'll be OK. When you book a room, here's what you could say:<br />Hello, I'd like to check availability and prices for a room please.<br />Does the price include breakfast?<br />Are there any business facilities such as internet and wi-fi?<br />I'd like to go ahead and make the reservation please.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>OK I'll give it a try. But where shall I look?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Try searching on the internet. Look for a five-star hotel. He is a five-star guest after all. Good luck.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Thanks. I better get back to the office and get started.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Hi Anna.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh hi Tom. Well done for saving Mr Ingle in that fire. You were very brave.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>It was nothing really. So… err... what are you doing?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I've got to book a hotel for Mr Socrates.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>No! You know, we must be in trouble. He never visits.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Really? So where shall I book him in to?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Well my friend runs a fantastic hotel – it's five star! It's called the Royal Imperial. Look, I've got his number. Give him a call, mention my name. You're bound to get a special rate.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Thanks Tom.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>No problem. Oh but don't forget, I've heard Mr S only likes a room with a single bed in it. He gets spooked out if there's another empty bed.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh right. OK, I might as well give it a try.</p> 
 <p><strong>Receptionist<br /></strong>Hello. Royal Imperial Hotel.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh, hello. I'd like to check availability and rates for a room.</p> 
 <p><strong>Receptionist<br /></strong>When for?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>For three nights from tonight. Your best room please!</p> 
 <p><strong>Receptionist<br /></strong>All our rooms are the best! But… yes, we have one. It's &pound;100 a night.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Right. I work with Tom…Tom Darcy… his friend runs the hotel. I wondered if you could offer me a special rate?</p> 
 <p><strong>Receptionist<br /></strong>Tom Darcy? No I've never heard of him. Sorry, it's still &pound;100.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Does the price include breakfast?</p> 
 <p><strong>Receptionist<br /></strong>Yes. We offer a full continental breakfast of toast, or bread, oh, and tea…or coffee….and cereal.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh. And do you have any business facilities?</p> 
 <p><strong>Receptionist<br /></strong>Well, we've got paper and pens.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I was thinking, internet, wi-fi… shoe-shine?</p> 
 <p><strong>Receptionist<br /></strong>Yes. We've got that.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Good. And most importantly, is this a single room?</p> 
 <p><strong>Receptionist<br /></strong>We've only got twin rooms.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Twins? You've only got room for twins?</p> 
 <p><strong>Receptionist<br /></strong>No. We could take a bed out and just leave one in, if you want?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh that would be perfect. In that case, I'd like to go ahead and make a reservation please.</p> 
 <p><strong>Receptionist<br /></strong>Good. How would you like to pay?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well done Anna for booking the hotel but I have a feeling Tom's recommendation may not be as luxurious as he says. Let's hear the phrases Anna used when booking a hotel:<br />Hello, I'd like to check availability and prices for a room please.<br />Does the price include breakfast?<br />Are there any business facilities such as internet and wi-fi?<br />I'd like to go ahead and make the reservation please.</p> 
 <p>So the room is booked. I wonder what Mr Socrates will think of it? He's a particularly fussy man as we'll find out next time. Bye!</p>

 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Phew, Tip Top Trading is safe – for now. It was just a fire drill. What a busy day this is turning out to be. Hey Anna, remember next time it could be for real so are you happy about what to say if you have to take charge?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh, not really.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Just keep calm and say things like:<br />There's no need to panic.<br />Please leave the building and meet outside.<br />Use the stairs not the lift.<br />And when you're outside, you could say: Is anybody missing?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>OK, thanks, but I hope I'll never need to use them.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Well done everyone. Hopefully you all know what to do in the unlikely event of a real fire. Now, to celebrate, I'm off to buy some really nice biscuits for all of us – you know, those special double-choc ones with the little orange bits. Back to work everyone.</p>

 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>I don't believe it! The fire alarm's gone off again. I'll call you back Marge. Oh, where's Paul when you need him? Anna, you're going to have to take charge.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Me? What about Tom?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>It looks like Tom has gone already.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Remember Anna, use those phrases to keep everyone calm and informed about what to do.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>OK. Err… there's no need to panic. Please leave the building and meet outside.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Hold on, I just need to grab my elephant dung notepad and red pen. Come on then Anna, into the lift.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>No Denise. We must use the stairs not the lift.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Oh, with my knees!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Jump up Denise, I'll carry you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Could I have your attention please.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Louder Anna. This is urgent!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Could I have your attention please! I need your full attention. Please stay calm. I'm sure there's not a fire, just a bit of smoke. Is there anybody missing?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Well, there's no smoke without fire, hey Tom! Tom? Tom? Has anyone seen Tom? That's Tom coming out of the building and he's carrying someone on his shoulder!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>It's Mr Ingle from the warehouse!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>It's OK everyone… I've put the fire out… it was in the warehouse. Mr Ingle had been smoking.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Mr Ingle!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Ingle<br /></strong>Err… yeah… sorry.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Sorry indeed! Mr Ingle's in serious trouble now. But well done Anna for dealing with that emergency and getting everyone out of the building. Here are some of the phrases she used:<br />There's no need to panic.<br />Please leave the building and meet outside.<br />Use the stairs not the lift.<br />And when you're outside, you could say:<br />Is anybody missing?<br />Seems like Tom is a bit of a hero. He has his uses! But hold on, who's this?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>Say Honey, looks like I've come at a good time. Have you seen a guy called Paul round here?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>He's not here, he's gone to buy some… err… biscuits. Can I help?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Socrates<br /></strong>Yeah sugar. I'm Mr Socrates, Paul's boss and I've come to sort this business out.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom &amp; Denise<br /></strong>Mr Socrates!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Oh no! The head of the company's in town. This means trouble. See you next time.</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Welcome back. Things are quite tense at Tip Top Trading today. Paul, the boss, mistakenly thinks Anna's been smoking on company premises and she's trying to explain herself.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>But, but…</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Frankly, I'm disappointed with you Anna. You're a hard worker but it doesn't mean you can go against company policy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Anna, remember the phrases we've learnt about a misunderstanding!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh yes. Paul, I think there's been a misunderstanding.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>A misunderstanding? How can you explain the smell of cigarette smoke? This is a 'no smoking' building.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Let me explain. I went down to the warehouse to speak to Mr Ingle and… well… someone else was smoking.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>What!? Someone was smoking in the warehouse? Golly gosh, that's highly dangerous. Who was it Anna?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Err… well… I can't really say. But I dealt with it and it won't happen again.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Yes, you dealt with it very well Anna but can you keep your secret about Mr Ingle safe?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Thank you Anna and sorry about the misunderstanding. Would you like a biscuit? Now I really think it's time we had a review of our health and safety procedures.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Denise, could you gather everyone round in the meeting room please.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>(On phone) I'll have to call you back Marge. (Hangs up) Could you all gather in the meeting room please, Paul has something important to say.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>What is it Denise? Is it about my fantastic sales figures again, huh?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>I doubt it Tom. It sounded urgent. I'd better bring some tea.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Thank you for joining me. Unfortunately, there has been an incident in the warehouse. Someone has been smoking and I'm not happy, so I thought I would remind you of our health and safety procedures.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Not this again!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Your safety is our responsibility. But to keep safe we must follow some simple rules. Denise, what's the first one?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>(Slurps tea) If you see a fire, raise the alarm – oh and call the fire service.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yeah, you love seeing those firemen, don't you, Denise!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Shhh Tom. Maybe you could tell us the other rule?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh yeah right. If you hear the fire alarm, get out quick.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Not exactly Tom. I think we should walk calmly to our nearest fire exit, following the green signs, go outside and meet at the fire assembly point.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Yes, and I will take a register of who is here, using my red pen (slurps tea).</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Do you mind not slurping Denise?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>This is thirsty work.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Hmm. Now is everyone clear about what to do if there is a fire alarm?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>It's usually a false alarm anyway.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>That's not the point. Now Anna, what about smoking?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>No smoking on company premises. But it wasn't me, it was Mr Ingle.</p> 
 <p><strong>All<br /></strong>Mr Ingle!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>I see, so it was Mr Ingle smoking in the warehouse. You should have told me Anna.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Sorry!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Right, I'm going to have to look into this. Back to work everyone… oh and take a biscuit with you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>So Anna's let the cat out of the bag – Mr Ingle won't be pleased – but at least she now knows what do if a fire breaks out. Here are some of the phrases we've heard today, that can be used in an emergency:<br />If you see a fire, raise the alarm.<br />Walk calmly to your nearest fire exit.<br />Meet at the fire assembly point.<br />No smoking on company premises.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Sorry to interrupt Paul… but the fire alarm's going off!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Don't panic anyone. Everything will be OK. (On phone) Jane, I'll have to call you back… yes, a bit of a panic. Bye. Quick, where's my red pen?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Uh-oh. Those emergency phrases might come in useful sooner than you think. Is this going to be the end of Tip Top Trading, will it really go up in smoke? Find out next time. Bye.</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello, welcome back to Tip Top Trading where Anna is going downstairs to speak to warehouse manager, Mr Ingle. You’re looking a bit nervous…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I am. Denise says if I speak to him in the wrong way, he might bite my head off!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Relax Anna. It’s just an expression to mean he might be a bit aggressive.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>You’ll be fine, just use the right polite phrases… oh, and smile!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>OK, I will. Oh look here I am…</p> 
 <p>(Warehouse door opens)</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Mr Ingle, are you there? I’d be most grateful if you could give me some… oh, what’s that smell… and smoke… Mr Ingle!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Ingle<br /></strong>Oh, oh (coughs)</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Mr Ingle. You’re smoking!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Ingle<br /></strong>Well… it’s my lunch break… so I’m allowed to smoke a cigarette, aren’t I?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Really? Are you sure?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>No, he’s not Anna! Smoking inside a public building is illegal – it’s against the law. It’s dangerous too - you’ve got to do something about this.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh right. Mmm, er, Mr Ingle, you mustn’t smoke… it’s wrong.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Ingle<br /></strong>Says who?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Err, Me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Anna. You’ll have to do better than that. Be polite, but be firm too. Try saying, ‘would you mind not doing that please?’</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I’ll try. Mr Ingle, would you mind not doing that please?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Ingle<br /></strong>Why’s that then?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>He’s not being very nice is he? You need to give your reasons. Say, ‘I’m afraid it’s against company policy’. Go on you can do it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Mr Ingle… I’m afraid it’s against company policy. And… it is actually against the law to smoke here… and… it’s not a nice smell, is it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Ingle<br /></strong>Well, smells OK to me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Well, I’m sorry to have to ask you this but you need to put it out.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Ingle<br /></strong>Put what out – the cat?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>No. You need to extinguish your cigarette… please.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Ingle<br /></strong>Says who?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Well, I’m sure your team wouldn’t like to see you breaking the law and besides, it could cause a fire. That would be awful.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Ingle<br /></strong>Yeah, I suppose it would.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I could get you some nicotine gum if you like?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Ingle<br /></strong>No, it’s OK. I’ll stub it out… as you asked so nicely.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Thank you Mr Ingle. We’ll keep it a secret this time, but please don’t do it again. I’m afraid it’s just not permitted on company premises.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Ingle<br /></strong>Yeah, whatever!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh and Mr Ingle, I still really like your overalls. Bye!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Nice one Anna. You dealt with Mr Ingle really well. You kept your cool and explained the reasons why he shouldn’t smoke. Let’s hope he doesn’t do it again Anna.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I hope not. I hate the smell of cigarette smoke. But I never got to ask him about stock management.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well, maybe it’s best to leave it for another time?</p> 
 <p>Anna’s had a tricky day so far dealing with Mr Ingle but she was firm and fair in the language she used. Here’s a reminder of the phrases she used:<br />Would you mind not doing that please?<br />I’m afraid it’s against company policy.<br />I’m afraid it’s not permitted.<br />Sorry to have to ask you this but…</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Ah Anna, there you are…. (sniffing) Have you been smoking?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>No!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>You smell of cigarette smoke. Look, I know you’re under pressure – but smoking in the building is not permitted.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Bbbut…</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>We take this very seriously. You had better step in to my office and we’ll talk about this.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Oh dear! Anna’s in trouble for no reason. Let’s hope she explains the mix-up, but that means telling Paul about Mr Ingle smoking. This is going to be difficult. Until next time, bye!</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello, welcome back to Tip Top Trading where everyone is gossiping about Paul’s announcement. Anna is to lead the company’s new stock management system for the new laser-curved fruit.<br />(Denise on phone)</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Yes Anna…the new girl…she’s done really well although I don’t know what experience she’s got….anyway, about the hairdresser you mentioned, oh I loved his aftershave…</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>I can’t understand it. I’ve got all the experience and all the ideas…she’s just such a…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Tom. Sorry to interrupt, I just wanted to check you’re ok with me leading this strategy for stock management.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh of course. Yeah, you deserve it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>That was a nice touch Anna.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>But Tom, now you must help me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Eh?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Anna! That’s not the best way to ask for help. Remember what I’ve always told you about politeness?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Be polite – yes you keep telling me that.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And if you want someone to help you, ask them, don’t tell them – even if it is Tom!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh right. I’m in a bit of a panic. I’ve never done this before. I don’t know where to begin.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well start by asking your colleagues for help like this:<br />I would be most grateful if you could give me some help<br />Please could I ask you for some advice?<br />I know you’re busy but could you spare me a few minutes of your time please?<br />Go on, give it a try!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Right, thanks. I'll try. Erm, excuse me Tom. Sorry about earlier. I’m a little nervous about leading this strategy thing and I would be most grateful if you could give me some help… please?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Of course Anna. Why didn’t you say, I’d be delighted. I’ve lost count of the number of projects I’ve lead over the years.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Great, thanks. So… where do you think I should begin?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Well, give me a few minutes and I’ll just find some of the excellent work I did last year. Basically, you’ll just need to copy it. Hold on…</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Ah Anna… just popping out for some biscuits… err, how’s the stock management strategy coming along?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh very good Paul… actually, please could I ask you for some advice, please?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Yes of course… although I don’t know if I’ll be much use!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>… now where did I save those damn documents?…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I’m very grateful for this opportunity but I’m a little unsure of where to start. Tom is looking for some his old work but…</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Really?! To be honest, this isn’t Tom’s speciality. At a time like this I would ask Denise.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Denise!?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Yes… she may only be the office assistant but she always has words of wisdom. Right… custard creams or chocolate digestives?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>What?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Biscuits?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh… custard creams please. Err, Denise, I know you’re busy but could you spare a few minutes of your time please?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Of course Anna, always happy to help you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Well you know the stock management control system?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>The one you’ve now got to work out… well done for getting that!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Thanks. I really don’t know where to begin. It was OK writing it down for Paul but how do I put it in to practice? There’s just too much to do!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Calm down Anna. You’ll be fine. The first thing you need to do is to look at our current system.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Look at our current system. How do I do that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Easy! Just take the lift down to the warehouse and speak to Mr Ingle and then write down what you find – and draw up an action plan of tasks you need to do – like a shopping list – I’m very good at those.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Go and see Mr Ingle? Oh do I have to.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>He’s ok really Anna. If you approach him in the right way he won’t bite your head off!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>What? Bite my head off! Oh… well, if he won’t bite me… then I suppose I should go and see him. Thanks for your advice Denise, I could kiss you. Right, I’m going to go and see him right now.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Make an action plan! A good idea. Well done Denise, you’re smarter than you look! And well done Anna, you eventually got the help you needed by using these phrases:</p> 
 <p><br />I would be most grateful if you could give me some help<br />Please could I ask you for some advice?<br />I know you’re busy but could you spare me a few minutes of your time please?</p> 
 <p>Remember, if you’re stuck for ideas just ask for help…but maybe not Tom, I wonder how he’s getting on?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>(shouting across room) Here Anna, I’ve got them. Look, all my ideas from my last stock control project…pages and pages of them. Just copy these, they’re brilliant. Anna? Anna!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>…too late, I’ve just seen her in the lift. Fancy a custard cream Tom?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>So Anna is off to speak to the prickly Mr Ingle. Let’s hope she uses those phrases to ask for help, otherwise she might get her head bitten off – and it could get very messy! See you next time.</p>

 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Here you go Anna, it's a print-out of the agenda for the meeting.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Thank you. Oh dear, I'm not sure if I know the right words to start meetings.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well, you can say something like: <strong>Thank you for coming. There are five items on the agenda today.</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Items?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>It's a fancy way of saying 'things'. Then you list them: <strong>Firstly, secondly, after that, and then, finally...</strong></p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes, that's easy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>At the end there is often something called<strong>&nbsp;Any other business</strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Any other business?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>That's anything else that wasn't listed on the agenda, but that people want to talk about. I expect Tom will want to talk about how great he is and Denise will want to talk about her new hairdresser or something. Then when it's time for the meeting to end, you can say: <strong>Let's wrap up</strong>. It means 'Let's finish'.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>To wrap up. OK, I'll do my best. Ooh, it's time, everyone is gathering.&nbsp;Thank you… thank you for coming. Paul will be here soon, but he asked me to start the meeting. There are... one, two, three, four items on the agenda today. Firstly, the stock management systems. Secondly, plans for a team-building activity. After that, the colour of our new apples and finally any other business, before we can wrap up.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Oh golly gosh, there you are, here I am, good. Hello everyone. Sorry I'm late.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I'd just opened the meeting.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Great. Remind me what the first item on the agenda is?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Stock.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Stock? Stock, stock, stock. Ah yes, stock management systems, yes, right. Well, that's mainly to announce that we need to start developing a good stock management system so we can meet the huge demand I’m expecting for these laser-curved fruits. Anna, I'd like you to lead on that.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Me? You want me to be in charge of the stock management systems?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Anna's had some excellent ideas already and I think she'll do a great job. For these new fruits, stock control will be key to supplying our customers with laser-curve oranges, laser-curve lemons, laser-curve pomegramates…</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well, that was good news for Anna - but not surprising after all her hard work. She opened the meeting well, too. Here's a reminder of the phrases she used:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Thank you for coming.</li> 
  <li>There are four items on the agenda today.</li> 
  <li>Firstly...</li> 
  <li>Secondly...</li> 
  <li>After that...</li> 
  <li>Then...</li> 
  <li>And finally...</li> 
  <li>Any other business.</li> 
  <li>And then we can wrap up.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>There's only one problem for Anna now, winning over Mr Ingle the warehouse manager – that won’t be easy. Well, time for me to wrap up now. See you soon! Bye!</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello, it's a chilly start to the day at Tip Top Trading.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Hi Denise!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Good morning Anna.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Brrr... it's so cold in here.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>The window was left open overnight.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>My papers have been blown everywhere.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Mine too! Tom was the last one here last night – it must've been him who left the window open.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Brrr.... Right then, to work! Oh, there's a note from Paul, it must've fallen off my desk: 'I would like your ideas on our stock management system for our new laser-curve fruit range, so we know we can keep up with demand. Please write me a couple of pages of suggestions and leave it on my desk. I'll be back this afternoon.' Wow! I have to come up with ideas for a stock management system! Gosh, where do I begin?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Good morning.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Morning!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Hey, my certificate for Plastic Pear Salesman of the Year is on the floor!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Right... stock management systems... stock-up on your laser-curved lemons … My first idea is to calculate the total….</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well, Anna has finished her report and left it on Paul's desk, but things aren't that simple. Er, Anna, there's going to be a problem.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh? A problem, bbbbut…</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Let me teach you some phrases you might need to explain that there's been a mistake:<br />I think there's been a misunderstanding.<br />Or:<br />There's been a bit of a mix-up.<br />Anna: But what misunderstanding? What mix-up?<br />Narrator: You could also use:<br />Let me explain what happened...</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>But-</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Ah, good afternoon everyone.</p> 
 <p><strong>All<br /></strong>Hello.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Tom, this is an excellent piece of work!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Sorry?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>These are by far the best ideas you've ever had.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>I don't understand.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong>Our stock management system!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Can I see? … Oh, that's not mine.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Eh?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I think there's been a misunderstanding. I did it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul &amp; Tom<br /></strong>You?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I got your note Paul, here.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>No, no, that note was for Tom.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh, then there's been a bit of a mix-up.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Did you take that note from my desk?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>No, no!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>I suppose you threw my pear salesman certificate on the floor at the same time too!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I didn’t! Let me explain. The wind must have blown the note for Tom under my desk.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Tom left the window open overnight. Our papers were blown all over the place.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>I see, well, golly gosh. In that case, well done, Anna! Excellent work, even though you weren't meant to do it. And Tom, your ideas are still welcome of course. Thanks.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Sorry Tom.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>What? Oh, I'm not bothered. I've still got some great ideas in my head anyway.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Yeah, right! Let's leave Tom to get on with his 'great ideas' and listen again those phrases Anna used to explain the misunderstanding:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>I think there's been a misunderstanding.</li> 
  <li>There's been a bit of a mix-up.</li> 
  <li>Let me explain what happened.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Well, the mix-up gave Anna a chance to shine – Paul certainly seemed impressed with her work. Maybe it will bring her new opportunities. Until next time, bye!</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello, Anna's just arrived at her desk to start the day at Tip Top Trading. Paul is walking towards her, eating a biscuit, he looks a bit bothered.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Anna?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes, Paul.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Come and have a biscuit in my office.<br />Now Anna, about Mr Lime.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I didn't say yes!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Pardon? Yes to what?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh, nothing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>You sent him an email yesterday and copied me in.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Your email reads: boxes ok. pls c-d-u cfirm wnt 300 ta.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes: please could you confirm you want 300.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Right. Now that's not really the best way of writing an email to a client, is it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Please could you re-send your message to Mr Lime, using actual words that make sense.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Okay.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Thank you. Have a chocolate crunchy!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Thanks.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Morning Anna.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Hello.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Let me guess, Paul just spoke to you about your email?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>How do you know?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>You copied me in remember, I just read it – or tried to.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>But what's the problem? Other people write like that!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>No, maybe some people write text messages like that in an SMS message on their phones, but that is completely the wrong style for an email to a client.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Okay Anna, let's stop listening to Tom, he's a waste of space. These are the kinds of phrases you need in a business-related email:<br />Dear Mr Lime...<br />I hope you are well.<br />I am writing regarding...<br />Please could you confirm...<br />Yours sincerely, or<br />Best wishes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Thank you! I'll rewrite my message. There! I'd better get it checked before I send. Denise?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>(On the phone) yes... the other problem with Stephanie is that her legs are just too long...</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh, she's on the phone.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>... yes, like trees...</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I'll have to ask Tom. Tom?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Mm?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Could you read this through before I send it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Hang on, Anna, let me just finish this sentence. It’s really important. I’m ready, let’s have a look. Okay. (reading) Dear Mr Lime, I hope you are well. I am writing regarding your request for luxury boxes for the Imperial Lemon Delivery. We will indeed be able to supply them. Please could you confirm that you want 300. Best wishes, Anna.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Well?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>It’s good, it's much better. Send it. Hopefully Mr Lime will think your last message was just someone sitting on your keyboard by mistake.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Thanks.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>You're not...</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>What?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Nothing. It's none of my business.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>What?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>You're not ever going to go to lunch with Mr Lime are you? I mean, in a non-business way...</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>No of course not!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>I mean I don’t care… it's just... important to... stay professional.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hmmm.... well, I had a feeling Anna's email was going to cause problems. But at least she won't make a mistake like that again. Here’s a reminder of the phrases she used in her new, improved email.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Dear Mr Lime...</li>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Welcome to the offices of Tip Top Trading...<br />(ongoing sound of annoying mobile phone ringtone)</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Anna, are you going to answer that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Er, well, no. It's stopped now anyway.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>...where Anna is behaving strangely.<br />(ringing starts again)</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>I gave you a long lesson on how to answer the phone and you're still too scared!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>It's not that.<br />(desk phone starts ringing)</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>For goodness sake!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Then what?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I recognise the number - it's Mr Lime!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Ha! Old Slimy Limy, he must be absolutely desperate to get you to have lunch with him – even after your cruel rejection. Here, I'll answer for you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>No!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>I'll answer. Hello, Tip Top Trading, Anna's phone... no, this is Denise speaking, Anna's busy at the moment. Can I take a message?... Yes... right.... I'll pass that on to her then… thank you for calling. Goodbye.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Well.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Nothing about lunch. He wants each Imperial Lemon you deliver to come in a luxury green box – like the one you had at the presentation.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>My goodness, we don't have many in stock, I'll have to order some. Erm...(dials a number) Hello, this is Anna speaking from Tip Top Trading, I want some imperial lemon-sized luxury boxes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Woah, woah, woah.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>What?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Let's make this order a bit more politely okay?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Why are the English so obsessed with being polite!?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Calm down Anna and listen to me. To put in an order for something, you need phrases like:<br />I'd like to place an order for...<br />We're going to need...<br />Could you send...<br />Could we also have...<br />When can we expect to receive them?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Right... Hello, sorry about that... I'd like to place an order for some imperial lemon-sized luxury boxes, please... we're going to need quite a few... could you send 300 please... yes... the green ones... could we also have the name of our company on the sides... when can we expect to receive them...okay, thank you, goodbye. There! How was that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Good, well done!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>You'd better phone back Mr Lime to confirm he can have his boxes!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh no!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>He's your client!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yes Anna, he's your client!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I'm scared he'll try and ask about lunch again.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Then send him an email.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Good idea!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Copy in me, Tom and Paul, so it’s clear you only mean business only.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes. Thanks Denise! An email is much safer.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Is it, Anna, is it? Hmmm...<br />Anyway, here are the phrases Anna used to place her order:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>I'd like to place an order for...</li> 
  <li>We're going to need...</li> 
  <li>Could you send...</li> 
  <li>Could we also have...</li> 
  <li>When can we expect to receive them?</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Let's see if Anna's email is really such a good idea. I have a bad feeling about it. Until next time!</p>

 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>(writing) go...</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>...away... Slimy Limey.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Go away Slimy Limey. Are you sure?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Of course!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Don't listen to him Anna. This is what you should say:<br />Thank you for your offer. But I'm really sorry, I won't be able to.<br />Then explain why, say I'm afraid… blah blah blah</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Blah blah blah?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Say it's against company policy to have non-business lunches with clients.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Meaning?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>You're not allowed to if it's not for business. Then say:<br />It wouldn't be appropriate. So, with regret, I'm going to have to say no.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Okay, I think I've got that all down. Thanks. He'll be waiting for my call.<br />(dials phone)</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>Hello, Seb Lime speaking.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Hello Mr Lime.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>Anna! Please, call me Seb. So, when can I invite you to lunch?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>(whispering loudly) Thank you for your offer...</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Well, thank you for your offer. But I'm really sorry, I won't be able to.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>Oh?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>(whispering loudly) I'm afraid...</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I'm afraid it's against company policy to have non-business lunches with people.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>Really? Oh how tedious!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>(whispering loudly) It wouldn't be-</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Shhh!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>Pardon?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>No, not shhh you Mr Slimy I meant shhhh Denise!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>Mr Slimy?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh no! I mean Mr Limey – Lime – er Seb! You see, it wouldn't be appropriate. So, with regret, I'm going to have to say no.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>I think I've understood. Goodbye Anna.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Goodbye.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Oh dear, he didn't take that too well. But, apart from a little mistake, Anna did well there. Here are the phrases she used to politely refuse the offer of lunch:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Thank you for your offer. But I'm really sorry, I won't be able to.</li> 
  <li>I'm afraid it is against company policy…</li> 
  <li>It wouldn't be appropriate.</li> 
  <li>With regret, I'm going to have to say no.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Good job Anna, bad luck Mr Slimy!</p>

 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello. Here we are in the middle of a telephone training session with Denise and Anna. What fun!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>…this time, you don't say 'yes' when you answer, it's rude. Call me and I'll show you how it's done.<br />(sound of 4-digit dialling, then phone rings)<br />Hello? Tip Top Trading.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Wow, that’s good.</p>

 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Say: &quot;Anna speaking!&quot;</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh, sorry, I'm so stressed by all this. Hello Anna speaking.</p>

 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Hello? Anna speaking.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Good. Now, when the person has introduced themself – this is Mrs Smith or whatever, say: Hello Mrs Smith, how can I help you? Or, if you know them already, you might say: Hello Mrs Smith, how are you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Okay, what if Mrs Smith wants to speak to Tom but he's not there?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>You say: &quot;I'm really sorry, he's not available at the moment. Can I take a message?&quot; Or: &quot;I'm afraid he's busy, shall I ask him to call you back?&quot;</p>

 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>I just wanted to say again that your Imperial Lemon is fantastic... and I was wondering if you'd like to do lunch with me sometime?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Lunch? Er...</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>I knew it! Mr Lime is interested in more than just your lemons!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Would you like to discuss the Imperial Lemon?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>Forget the lemons Anna! The reason I want to see you is more of a personal nature.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Personnel? Er... Can I call you back? I'm afraid I'm a bit busy at the moment...</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>…bbbut…</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello. We're back at Tip Top Trading. Anna is very busy dealing with Mr Lime's big order for Imperial Lemons.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes?... Who?... I can't hear you. Mr what? What? Mr Who? I don't know, you tell me. Oh, you are Mr Hu... H-U: Hu. Er... No, Tom's busy. Call back later. Bye. Tom, Mr Hu called you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Mr Hu-</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Mr Hu: H-U</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Anna, Mr Hu is a very important-<br />Oh! What now?! Yes?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>(to himself) I'm going to have to talk to the boss about this.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>No. I'm busy, give me your number, I'll call you later. Yep, yep, 6... 8... thanks. Bye! Right, now where was I?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Anna, could I have a word?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes. Ohhh, he must want to tell me how pleased he is with the Citrus Ventures deal.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Now, Anna... biscuit?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Thank you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>I'm a little bit concerned about something.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>&quot;I'm a little bit concerned...&quot; Doesn't that mean something bad?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Yes, Anna, Paul is using a polite turn of phrase to say he is unhappy about something. Let's see what he's got to say....</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>I think you need to work on your telephone manner.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Work on my telephone manner?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>It means the way you talk on the phone is not good enough and you have to improve it – to work on it to make it better.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Perhaps you should think about …</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Perhaps you should think about – that's a polite way of telling you to do something!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Anna, are you listening to me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes, sorry, I was just sort of, err, talking to myself. Could you repeat what you said please?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Right, I'll start again. I said: I'm a little bit concerned about your telephone manner. You need to work on the way you speak to clients. Perhaps you should think about being a bit more polite to clients; it's important for the image of the company.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh okay.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>You can go now – take another biscuit with you – that's my last chocolate wafer, you lucky thing!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Anna? Is everything all right?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>What's the matter?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Paul says I need to w-w-w-work on my telephone manner.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Well I was a bit concerned about it myself. And I think Tom actually mentioned it to Paul.</p> 
 <p>But, look, I'll help you if you like. I'm a bit of an expert on the phone. I'll give you some lessons.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh thank you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Come in early tomorrow morning, before the others get here and we'll practise.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Thank you Denise, that's very kind.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Wow! Denise is actually being nice to Anna. Amazing! Although from what I've heard of Denise on the phone, she's only ever gossiping with friends. Paul was very gentle and polite in the way he explained to Anna there was a problem and that she needed to improve some things. He used these phrases:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>I'm a little bit concerned about...</li> 
  <li>You need to work on...</li> 
  <li>Perhaps you should think about...</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Let's see if Denise manages to teach Anna anything useful next time. Until then!</p>

 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Just talk! Just talk! You just talk! What on earth am I going to say? My mind is blank.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Try to remember the key points you wanted to share, and give them one by one. If you can, give some facts that support each point.

 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Yes, but try not to bark out information like a robot.<br />Look people in the eye, slow down and try to be more conversational….oh, and smile!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>(more conversationally) Tip Top Trading is growing fast – our number of clients doubled last year. This is because our company has a strong track record of reliability and because, thanks to new technology, our fruits are more and more convincing. Our bananas have won awards for being the most authentic-looking fruits in Europe. We are very happy that Citrus Ventures is already among our clients and we hope to build on that by offering you more exciting new fruits. Let me share with you our latest product: (sound of unzipping of a bag) the Imperial Lemon.<br />(impressed murmur from the audience)<br />The Imperial Lemon's key strengths are its design and flexibility. It is made with revolutionary faux-orange-premium, laser-curve-definition technology... (fade out)</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>What an excellent performance from Anna. She focussed on some key points, supported them with facts and structured her answer clearly. She also managed to relax and sound more natural. She used these phrases:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>The company has a strong track record of...</li> 
  <li>Let me share with you..</li> 
  <li>The Imperial Lemon's key strengths are...</li>

 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>Fantastic Anna, fantastic!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Thank you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>Those... lemons – wow. I'd like to put in an order for three hundred thousand right away.</p>

 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well, as usual, Anna seems to be turning a difficult situation into a success. She used the phrases we discussed, which made her opening clear and well-structured. She said:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Today I'm going to...</li> 
  <li>I'll start by...</li> 
  <li>And then I'm going to move on to discuss…</li> 
  <li>And finally...</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>But that's just the beginning, now she's got to get through the rest of the pitch – how will that go?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>…this picture shows….oh no, why isn’t it working…I should just click on this….oh, what’s wrong with this stupid computer!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Uh oh! It was all going so well but now Anna’s got computer problems. What is she going to do? We'll find out next time. Bye!</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>It's late at the offices of Tip Top Trading. Anna is alone, working. Again. She's been doing this all week, she wants her presentation to Mr Lime to be perfect so she's been spending hours and hours on it. Anna?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Don't interrupt! I'm busy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Woah!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Sorry.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Anna, you're really burning the candle at both ends.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>What?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Burning the candle at both ends – it means working very hard – working late and getting up early to work all the time.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh. I didn't know that expression.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well here are some more: <br />You're doing overtime; which means you're working longer than office hours. <br />You're putting in the hours; which means you are spending all the time needed to achieve something.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes, I'm putting in the hours to make sure my presentation is perfect.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And if you don't mind me saying so, you might burn out; which means you are working so hard that you might get very tired and run out of energy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I'm not burning out. I'm full of energy. I just need to finish this bit...</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>My goodness, nothing's locked. Do you think we've been burgled?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh no! I left my lap-book and my me-pad on the desk... and my i-top – they're worth thousands! They're all the latest versions!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>I left out my elephant mug and my lady-curve nail file. They better not have stolen them!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>(Talking in her sleep) but it's premium, premium, faux-orange premium!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Anna?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>It's Anna, she's asleep. Anna!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>(waking up with a jump) Oh! Lemons! Denise? Tom?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Have you spent the night asleep at your desk Anna?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Is it morning? Oh dear, yes I think so.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Well, at least we haven't been burgled then.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Anna, you've really been burning the candle at both ends lately.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Yes, you've been doing hours and hours of overtime. Most people get their work done within office hours and anyway, we don't pay overtime here. You’ll never find me working late!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yes, I'd noticed that Denise.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>But this presentation must be perfect.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>If you're not careful, you'll burn out! Then you'll really be of no use to anyone. You'll be as useful as a chocolate teapot.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>It's good that you're putting in the hours Anna, but you should calm down. Look at me, I do very successful presentations without spending hours preparing.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Ha!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>In my presentation to Every Apple I just swooshed in with no preparation after a night on the town. I charmed them. They loved me!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Idiot. I bet he actually spent hours preparing he just can't admit it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Well, maybe you're right. I can't think clearly anymore, I'm so tired. I need to sleep properly otherwise I'll end up trying to sell bananas instead of lemons.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Anna has finally got the message: she's realised she's been working too much. She needs to be realistic. Here's a reminder of some of the phrases we heard to talk about how much Anna had been working:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Burning the candle at both ends.</li> 
  <li>Doing overtime.</li> 
  <li>Putting in the hours.</li> 
  <li>Burning out.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Let's hope she's thinking clearly by the time she has to do her presentation. Join us next time to find out! Bye.</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Welcome! The team at Tip Top Trading are hard at work, making plans for the launch and presentation of their latest product: the revolutionary, almost real Imperial Lemon. They are 'brainstorming', sharing ideas on how to make their lemon a success.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>But it needs to be bright!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>This is much more exciting.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>But having three colours would work better.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>There is a lot of disagreement going on, which is putting Anna's vocabulary to the test!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Right, I'm taking the final decision: the colour scheme will be green and yellow, so that's that. Now, the first presentation will be to er, Mr, er, Slime.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Mr Lime.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Oh, er, Mr Lime - that bit of biscuit looked like an 's' – Mr Lime, thank you Annabel.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Anna.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Mr Lime and his team at Citrus Ventures. Ideas please!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Why don't we offer Citrus Ventures a special opening offer: 20% off Imperial Lemon orders made this month.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Hmm...</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>We could even do that for all our regular clients.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>That would be a big risk.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>No.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>If we do that once, all our clients will start asking for 20% off everything.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>No, I disagree.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>We'll be bankrupt!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>No, you're wrong.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Er- Anna, maybe you should find a better way of saying you disagree with Denise.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I'm so frustrated! I can't think of the right words.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>It helps if you try phrases like: <br />Well, I'm not so sure about that... then explain why. <br />Or start your sentence with 'but' when you want to disagree with what has just been said. <br />Or, to seem more polite, you can try: <br />I see your point, but actually I think...</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I'll try.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And don't be aggressive Anna - and give your reasons too, or you'll upset Denise again!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>OK. Well, I'm not so sure about that. I think it will improve our sales of lemons and make our clients happy. Happy clients will come back to buy more.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Yes, that's a good point Annabe - Anna.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>But 20% is a lot – maybe 5% would be better.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>But if we're going to make a special offer, we should make it so good that everyone will say yes!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>But people might think there's something wrong with our lemons and that we're desperate to get rid of them.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I see your point, but, if we explain this is just a special offer for special clients, they'll understand.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>I like that idea. Good: 20% off for all regular clients just for this month. Anna, you'll be making the presentation to Citrus Ventures, so make sure you include that offer.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Uh-huh.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Right, next, what photos do we have of the lemons...?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Finding the right words to disagree in meetings isn't always easy, but Anna managed in the end. She started sentences with this short word to show that she was about to disagree with what had just been said:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>But...</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>And used these phrases:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>I'm not so sure about that......</li> 
  <li>I see your point, but actually I think...</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>The next big challenge for Anna will be her presentation to Citrus Ventures. Join us again soon to find out what happens!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I've got to do a good job but it's going to take me ages. Ah well, I had better get started otherwise I'm going to be here all night!</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Welcome back! This is what's happening today: as a result of some embarrassing mistakes in deliveries, Tip Top Trading's big boss in America has ordered a re-check of every order this month. So, Paul is talking to key customers to see if they've got what they needed:</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>I just want to check you're happy with the grapes?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Tom, whom we all know was responsible for the disaster, is phoning his clients to make sure he has the correct information about what they want:</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Ya, yah, I just want to make absolutely sure we get the order right for you and have the correct number of fruit...</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Denise is, well, talking on the phone to a friend.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Brown shoes don't look right on him! He's not a brown shoe sort of person...</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Anna has to go down to the warehouse, where the products are prepared for delivery.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I have to speak to Mr Ingle. Apparently he's not very friendly! He might not like me asking lots of questions!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well, be polite, and start your sentences with things like: <br />I just want to make sure that... <br />Could you possibly clarify... <br />I just want to check... <br />Just to be absolutely clear... <br />One thing I wasn't sure of was...</p> 
 <p>Good luck!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Mr Ingle, I don't think we've met yet, I'm Anna.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ingle<br /></strong>Hello. Oi! What are you doing with those boxes? I told you to put them in storage. Anna, is it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes, sorry to bother you, I just want to check something. We've had a few problems with orders….</p> 
 <p><strong>Ingle<br /></strong>Well, that's not my fault. I do exactly what I'm asked to do. (To workers) No, not there, in storage!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh, well, I just want to make sure that….</p> 
 <p><strong>Ingle<br /></strong>Thirty years I've been doing this job, and I've never made a mistake.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Of course, but because we've had problems, we need to make absolutely sure that all deliveries are correct.</p> 
 <p><strong>Ingle<br /></strong>Humph.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Could you possibly clarify what went out in today's delivery to Mr Berry of, er, Bluetree Enterprises?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ingle<br /></strong>500 redcurrants.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Right. That's fine.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well done Anna, this is going very well. Remember that other phrase – &quot;I just want to check…&quot;</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>OK. Now, I just want to check what was sent to Cocoline Limited – it should have been fifteen mangos...</p> 
 <p><strong>Ingle<br /></strong>Yeah. That's right.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Great, and just to be absolutely clear, you sent the soft mangos, not the plastic ones?</p> 
 <p><strong>Ingle<br /></strong>Yes, just like I was told to.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Good. One thing I wasn't sure of was whether we had enough yellow bananas in stock – I know there are some purple ones, but...</p> 
 <p><strong>Ingle<br /></strong>Yeah well, we do need more yellow bananas.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Okay, I'll just write that down. Thank you Mr Ingle. By the way, I like your overalls!</p> 
 <p><strong>Ingle<br /></strong>Oh thanks.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well he was a bit unfriendly, but Anna got what she needed. Here are the phrases she used:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>I just want to make sure that...</li> 
  <li>Could you possibly clarify...</li> 
  <li>I just want to check...</li> 
  <li>Just to be absolutely clear...</li> 
  <li>One thing I wasn't sure of was...&nbsp;</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Well, everything in the warehouse seems to be okay. Back in the office, Tom is having less luck.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>(on the phone) Really? Here it says 5,000 not five... oh...</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>It's going to be a long day for him! Until next time. Bye!</p>

"<p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Good afternoon.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna &amp; Tom<br /></strong>Hi, good afternoon.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Anna, Tom, room 301 please. Now.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Welcome back to Tip Top Trading, where things are a teeny bit tense today. Paul has called Tom and Anna into room 301, the place where difficult conversations happen. Perhaps Paul has found out about yesterday's unhappy clients.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh dear.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>You should be okay Anna. After the way you coped with Mr Lime, you should be praised.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Really? What do you think Paul will say?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well, if he is pleased, he'll say things like:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Well done.</li> 
  <li>You handled it well.</li> 
  <li>Great job.</li> 
  <li>I'm really impressed.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>And if he's not?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well, I suppose – oop. Here’s Paul now!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Well, Tom, Anna... Yesterday was not a great day. Two clients came in with serious complaints. Mrs Kumquat received a delivery of imitation bananas that were purple, not very convincing. And Mr Lime ordered grapefruits, but got pineapples. Tom.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Were you responsible for these errors?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Well... yes, but…</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Look, mistakes happen. But it seems that Mrs Kumquat left our offices even angrier than when she came in and she says she will never use Tip Top Trading again.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>I tried my best.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Hmmm. I understand you told her to spray-paint the bananas and to 'stop being such a miserable old witch'.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yeah, well look, she'd been very rude to me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>If you weren't such a good salesman I would fire you for that. Anna.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Well done. Not only was Mr Lime satisfied that his problem would be resolved, but we might even get some extra business from him, thanks to your Imperial Lemon proposal.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I hope so.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>You were in a difficult situation and you handled it well. You remained calm, friendly and professional. So, great job. I'm really impressed. I'm going to…</p> 
 <p>(phone rings)</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Who's that? Oh no. It's a call from the USA.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh god!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>What?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>It's the boss!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Whose boss?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Ours! The big, big boss, based in America.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Shhhh! (on the phone) Hellooo? Ah, good afternoon Mr Socrates, I mean, er- morning, ha ha, where you are it's … yes, no, n-yes …. I'm not sure. Mrs Kumquat … did she? … well, it was very unfortunate …. purple, yes …. totally unacceptable …. I will. If you'd like I could …. Mr Socrates? Hello? Mr Socrates? Oh, he's gone. Right where was I? Tom, great work. Anna, I'm disappointed. No, no, Anna, great work, I want you to take charge of the Imperial Lemon presentation. Tom, if you speak to a client like that again there will be disciplinary action. Mrs Kumquat was so angry she even emailed Mr Socrates. Ok, that’s it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Phew! What a relief for Anna. Let's listen again to some of the phrases Paul used to praise her:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Well done.</li> 
  <li>You were in a difficult situation and you handled it well.</li> 
  <li>So, great job. I'm really impressed.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>He also explained why he thought Anna had done a good job:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>You remained calm, friendly and professional.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Excellent work Anna. But Tom's mistakes have given everyone a lot of work to do tomorrow.</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Ah hello! Welcome back to Tip Top Trading – the UK's leading wholesaler of imitation fruit. Today you're joining us in the middle of the action! Anna is with an important client Mr Lime, from Citrus Ventures. He's angry and she'll have to calm him down. She could cope brilliantly here or this could be a horrible mess!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Well Mr Lime, how can I help you?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>On Monday I was meant to receive 8,000 plastic grapefruit from Tip Top Trading.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>The delivery was made on Tuesday.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh dear.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>And instead of 8,000 plastic grapefruit, I got 800,000 plastic pineapples!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Right Anna, this is serious. You're going to have to apologise and show that you really mean it. Say: I'm really sorry to hear that.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I'm really sorry to hear that, Mr Lime.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>What on earth am I going to do with 800,000 plastic pineapples?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Show Mr Lime that you understand the problem. These are phrases you can use: That's totally unacceptable. That must have been very inconvenient for you. And then promise to fix the problem. Say: You have my word that we will sort this out. We can do something to make up for the inconvenience. It won't happen again.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>800,000 plastic pineapples!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>That's totally unacceptable.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>I didn't even have anywhere to put them - and pineapples are so much bigger than grapefruit!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>It must have been very inconvenient for you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>It certainly was! When he took my order, your colleague Tom told me that Tip Top Trading was the most reliable firm in the industry!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>You have my word that we will sort this out. We'll remove the pineapples and have your grapefruit sent via express delivery this afternoon.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>Good. Thank you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>And we could include some of our latest-edition imitation oranges to make up for the inconvenience.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>Oh! Well, that would be nice!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Tip top Anna! Excellent work and excellent words.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>They're made with revolutionary premium faux-orange, laser-curve definition technology... you will be the first to have them!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>Wow, now that's good customer service! Tell me, do you have any other artificial fruits in this range?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes. Well, it's a bit of a secret, but you're a trusted client, so I think I can tell you...</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>Go on...</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>We're about to unveil a new Imperial Lemon.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>Really?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I can't tell you any more for now. But…</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>Yes...</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Maybe we could present it to you more formally in a couple of weeks, when it's ready for release...?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>Sounds perfect.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>You would be the first to see it!</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>Excellent. Thank you, er... Anna, isn't it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>A very pretty name.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Thanks. It's spelled the same forwards and backwards.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>Is it really?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Anyway, Mr Lime, we'll fix this grapefruit problem for you, and I promise you, it won't happen again.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>Good, good. You're new here, aren't you Anna?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>Well I look forward to working with you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>What a success! Mr Lime has come away a very happy customer! Here are the phrases Anna used while apologising:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>I'm really sorry to hear that, Mr Lime.</li> 
  <li>That's totally unacceptable.</li> 
  <li>It must have been very inconvenient for you.</li> 
  <li>You have my word that we will sort this out.</li> 
  <li>And we could include some of our latest-edition imitation oranges to make up for the inconvenience.</li> 
  <li>I promise you, it won't happen again.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>What will Anna's boss Paul have to say about her work today? Join us next week to find out.</p>

"<p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>‘Look forward to hearing from you soon. Kind regards, Anna.’</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>(on the phone) ... And Margery said: 'I don't think I've ever seen a&nbsp;vegetable quite that size before...'</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Where's that hole-punch?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Ah, business as usual in the offices of Tip Top Trading.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh for goodness sake! What a disaster! I can't believe it!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>But one member of the team seems bothered.<br /><br /><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Arrgh!<br /><br /><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Anna, this is the moment to show you’re willing to help.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Use phrases like 'Is there anything I can do?' 'Let me help!' or, to be more informal, you can say, 'Can I give you a hand?' or 'Give me a shout if you need anything!'</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Right.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Go on!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Are you okay Tom?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>(grumpily) No.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Is there anything I can do?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>(grumpily) No.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh. What's wrong?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Everything.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I see. Can I give you a hand?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>My computer has crashed. I've lost my phone. And there's a big, big&nbsp;problem with my timetable. I’ve got two meetings scheduled at the same<br />time with two extremely important clients. I can't do them both at once!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Let me help.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Thanks Anna, but these are big, big clients. They need someone of&nbsp;experience.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Well, give me a shout if you need anything!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>I can handle this, alright?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>'I can handle this'... ungrateful idiot. But you used all the right phrases Anna, well done. Anyway, I bet he'll change his mind.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Oooh, I know, and the purple ones are so much more powerful...</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Anna? Could you help me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Ha! I told you so!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>They've both arrived at once! Oh god! I'll deal with Mrs Kumquat...</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Okay.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>You talk to Mr Lime, he's from a company called Citrus Ventures. They own&nbsp;hundreds of juice bars.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Are you sure that's a good idea Tom?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>I don't have much choice, do I?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Well I could</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom</strong><br />Just keep him occupied Anna, tell him how great he is... no, no, tell him&nbsp;how great I am. Find out what he wants. If it's about the - well, never<br />mind, just be nice.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Understood.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Mr Lime! Are you well?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>Yes, but I'm actually rather angry too.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Ah, well let me introduce you to Anna!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Mr Lime, it's a pleasure to meet you! Let me help with your coat.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>Oh er... Thank you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Can I give you a hand with your scarf too, Mr Lime?</p> 
 <p><strong>Mr Lime<br /></strong>Oh... Thanks.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Now, please come this way and you can tell me what's wrong.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well done! Anna used some good phrases to step in and help with this&nbsp;mess. Let's hear them again:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Is there anything I can do?</li> 
  <li>Let me help.</li> 
  <li>Can I give you a hand?</li> 
  <li>Give me a shout if you need anything.</li>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Welcome back to English at Work. We're still in Anna's first week in the&nbsp;busy offices of Tip Top Trading. How's it going Anna?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Everything's still so new to me. I keep needing to ask people for help!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well, that's only natural at the beginning. To ask people politely for help use the words would and could. You can also use the word please, but don't make the mistake of thinking's enough to make what you say polite.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Er, ok.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Hello Anna!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh hi, Paul!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>I was wondering if you could do something for me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes of course.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Would you be able to print out a file for me? It's a document on CBL –&nbsp;Convincing Bananas Limited – they're one of our suppliers. The file should<br />be on the system and could I have it in the next ten minutes please, as&nbsp;they're on their way here for a meeting?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes. Oh no, I've no idea how to find it! Tom...?!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Er, ask Denise. She should know.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Ok, thanks Tom, I'll ask her.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>(on the phone to Sharon) I'd warned her, you know, I said 'Victoria, if you&nbsp;don't change your hairdresser</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong><br />Denise?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>One day you'll… hold on a moment. Anna?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Please email me the background file on CBL.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Er!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Thank you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>(on the phone) Who does that girl think she is?... Anna... new girl... I told&nbsp;you about her... yes with the saucepans, that's the one. She's only been<br />here five minutes and she's already acting like the Queen of Sheba...&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh and Denise, please send it to me within five minutes, Paul needs it soon. Thank you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Really!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>He he, good to see who's the boss, eh Denise?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Really!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Er, Anna, I think you've upset Denise...?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Upset Denise?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>You were a bit rude when you asked her to help.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Was I?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Remember what I said Anna. Just using ‘please’ to ask someone to do&nbsp;something can sound a little rude.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Instead of saying 'Please send me the file' you could say 'Could you&nbsp;possibly send me the file?' or 'Would you mind sending me the file?'</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh! English is so confusing! I'll try to remember that. Oh no, the printer&nbsp;isn't even set up! Tom?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yeah?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Please help me with…I mean, could you possibly help me with the printer?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Er... I need to finish this email to a really important new client.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>But it's really urgent. Would you mind writing your email later?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Okay, since you asked so nicely. Let's have a look...</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well, it's a good thing Anna has understood how to use 'could' and 'would'&nbsp;to ask for things, before she upsets anyone else. Let's hear those phrases<br />again:</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>I was wondering if you could do something for me?<br />Would you be able to print out a file for me?<br />Could I have it within ten minutes please?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Could you possibly help me with the printer?<br />Would you mind writing your email later?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>The printer seems to be working well, but how well are Anna and Denise&nbsp;working together? Are these two going to be enemies?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Really! 'Denise do this! Denise do that!' I'm telling you Sharon, I've almost&nbsp;had enough! I get treated like I'm some kind of servant!</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Last week, Anna got the job of sales executive at Tip Top Trading, thanks&nbsp;to her quick-thinking in an office crisis. Today it's her first day in the office.&nbsp;How are you feeling now, Anna?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Excited, but a bit worried. I really want to make a good first impression.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well, you're going to need some phrases to introduce yourself politely,&nbsp;such as:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Hello, I don't think we've met.</li> 
  <li>You must be – and say the person's name.</li> 
  <li>I've just joined the team.</li> 
  <li>Nice to meet you.</li> 
  <li>Have you worked here long?</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Why don't you start by saying hello to Tom Darcy, the Senior Account&nbsp;Manager?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yah, yah, no, yah, yah, OK, yah. I'll seal the deal, yah, no&nbsp;worries. OK, see ya mate, bye!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Hello, I don't think we've met.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>No.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>You must be Tom. I'm Anna. I've just joined the team.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Uh huh.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Nice to meet you. Have you worked here long?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Sorry, I'm quite busy right now – I've got a big deal just coming through.&nbsp;But let's get together sometime. Um... can you do lunch tomorrow?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>You want me to do lunch? Well, I'm not very -</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Sorry, important client. Lunch tomorrow at 12.30 then?<br />(On the phone) Tom speaking. Yah! Frankie! So what's the latest, are we&nbsp;on?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Well, OK then.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Great Anna! You used some nice phrases to introduce yourself. It's a&nbsp;shame Tom thinks he's too important to do the same.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I'm sure he's just busy. But I'm a bit worried about tomorrow!</p> 
 <p>(The next day…)</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Good morning Paul!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Good morning Anna, are you OK?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Fine, the kitchen's through there, isn't it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Er, yes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Anna!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh hi, Denise!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>What are you doing?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Cooking lunch for Tom.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>You what?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Tom asked me to have lunch ready for 12.30.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Did he indeed?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Er, Anna.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Hi Tom!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>What are you doing?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Spring rolls, followed by crispy duck in black bean sauce.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>No, I mean, why are you cooking?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Well, if I don't start now, it won't be ready for you by 12.30.</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Oh, you misunderstood me, Anna. When I said &quot;Can you do lunch?&quot; it&nbsp;didn't mean &quot;Can you make lunch?&quot; It meant &quot;Are you available to come to&nbsp;lunch with me?&quot; In a cafe or something.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Mmm... something smells good, but what's going on here?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Anna thinks it's her job to cook for people!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>No, no, I misunderstood!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Anna just got a bit confused.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Well, never mind, it looks tasty.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>There's enough for everyone if you want some.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>I think that's a splendid idea, we can have an office picnic!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Mmm, that sauce looks delicious.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes, it's my favourite.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well, once again everything has worked out well for Anna! Before we go, a&nbsp;reminder of the phrases she used:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Hello, I don't think we've met.</li> 
  <li>You must be Tom.</li> 
  <li>I've just joined the team.</li> 
  <li>Nice to meet you.</li> 
  <li>Have you worked here long?</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Just remember - if somebody says &quot;Would you like to do lunch?&quot; they're&nbsp;not usually expecting you to cook for them! Goodbye.</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Here we are again at Tip Top Trading, where Anna's interview for a sales&nbsp;job has been suddenly interrupted. Office assistant Denise has entered the&nbsp;room, looking very worried. What's wrong? And will Anna have any&nbsp;suggestions that might help?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>I don't know what to do!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>So what's the matter Denise?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>You know the PowerPoint presentation?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>The one we've been preparing for the last two months?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Yes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>The one that's very, very important and that we need this afternoon?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>That one.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Aha.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>We've lost everything!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>No!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>I had it on a USB stick, to transfer it, but the stick has vanished!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Right Anna, now is your chance to help them find solutions to the problem.<br />You'll need phrases like:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Can I make a suggestion?</li> 
  <li>Why don't you...?</li> 
  <li>Have you tried...?</li> 
  <li>Maybe we could...?</li> 
  <li>How about...?</li> 
  <li>I have an idea!</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>But don't you have it saved on your computer?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>No, it was taking up a lot of space, so I deleted it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>So you have lost the only copy we have.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Yes.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>What idiots! I've never seen such a disorganised office. Go on, you'd better&nbsp;help them, Anna.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Can I make a suggestion?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Yes, please do!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Why don't you try looking in your recycle bin? It might still be there.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>I did. It isn't.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Have you tried asking your colleagues if they've seen the memory stick?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>I did. They haven't.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>How about looking through your rubbish bin to see if you threw it away by&nbsp;mistake?<br /><br /><strong>Denise<br /></strong>(getting shirty) I don't do silly things like that!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>All very sensible suggestions Anna, thank you.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Maybe I could do a big office search for you...? I'm good at finding things.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>There are confidential documents in this office – non-staff are not allowed&nbsp;to see them.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Now, now Denise. Why don't you drink up that nice tea?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I have an idea! Did you ever email the presentation to anyone?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Golly gosh, you did Denise! You emailed it to me to proof-read. It'll be in&nbsp;my inbox somewhere. Good thinking Anna!</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>I was just about to suggest that myself.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Problem solved. Thank you Anna!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Pleasure.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well done Anna!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Right, now please leave us Denise. Anna and I will continue our interview.&nbsp;Would you like a biscuit Anna?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Thank you. Oh, what's that?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Oh golly gosh, the USB stick! It was mixed in with the plate of biscuits that&nbsp;Denise brought in.<br /><br /><strong>Anna<br /></strong>It's wet</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Yes, I think maybe I stirred my tea with it at one point. Oh well. Now,&nbsp;where were we...?&nbsp;My goodness, it's 11 o'clock! I have a meeting right now! I'm afraid I'm&nbsp;going to have to go. But I've made my mind up about you anyway. I&nbsp;suppose you'd like to know if you've got the job?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Yes please!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Ah - Stop right there! I'm sure everybody would like to know if Anna's got&nbsp;the job – but everybody's going to have to wait until we've heard her&nbsp;helpful phrases once again:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Can I make a suggestion?</li> 
  <li>Why don't you try looking in your recycle bin?</li> 
  <li>Have you tried asking your colleagues if they've seen the memory stick?</li> 
  <li>How about...?</li> 
  <li>Maybe I could do a big office search for you...?</li> 
  <li>How about looking through your rubbish bin...?</li> 
  <li>I have an idea!</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Anna, we need someone who can think on her feet and who is a first-rate&nbsp;people person. Someone who sees solutions, not problems... someone like&nbsp;you! So if you want the job, it's yours!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Ah, now think carefully Anna – do you really want to work for these&nbsp;people? They seem a bit... disorganised.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I would definitely like the job! Thank you!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>So be it. Join us again next week for Anna's first day as a sales executive&nbsp;at Tip Top Trading.</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hello! Welcome back to the offices of Tip Top Trading, where Anna's&nbsp;interview for a sales job continues. When we last said goodbye, Tip Top&nbsp;boss Paul had asked Anna why she wanted the job. First she said:</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Errr... mmmmm...</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Since then, she's added:</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Mmmm... errr...</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And as we join her again, Anna is saying:</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Well, errrr... I'm errr.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Come on, Anna! If you can't think of the word you need, find another way&nbsp;of saying it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I am... Well, I really, really want this job and I am willing to work very&nbsp;hard if I get it.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>So you’re very motivated, then?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Motivated! Yes, that’s it. I am really motivated.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Good! Why?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Now over to you Anna; structure your answer! Say, 'firstly', then give your&nbsp;first reason, 'secondly' and then a second reason. Then say, 'above all' and&nbsp;give a really, really good, enthusiastic final reason! Go for it: firstly!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Firstly!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Firstly...?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Firstly, this job is an ideal match for my skills and experience: I've spent&nbsp;several years working in sales and I get on with people easily. Well, I&nbsp;mean, apart from the ones I don't like, of course. Secondly, I know Tip Top&nbsp;Trading is one of the fastest-growing companies in London, and I want to&nbsp;be part of that.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>That's absolutely right. Tip Top Trading is the fastest-growing company in&nbsp;the plastic fruit sector. But enough about the company; this is all about&nbsp;you, Annabel.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Anna.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Sorry, Anna. Where were we?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Well, I said that firstly, this job is an ideal match for my skills and&nbsp;experience, secondly, the company is growing fast... and… and… above&nbsp;all… the reason I want this job is…</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Yes? (knock on the door) Denise! Is everything alright?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>No Paul, it’s not. Everything is not OK!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>You look pale. Here, sit down, drink what's left of my tea.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Oh, thank you! Oh… what are those bits floating in it?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Oh they're just lumps of soggy biscuit. In fact, if I can just... get that bit&nbsp;out... with my finger... for you… Mmm, delicious! Now, tell me what&nbsp;happened.</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Well, it's terrible...</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Oh dear! Just as Anna was doing really well, it looks like her interview has&nbsp;come to a sudden end. What’s happened? Join us next time to find out. But&nbsp;before we go, here's a reminder of how Anna structured her response:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Firstly, this job is an ideal match for my skills and experience</li> 
  <li>Secondly, I know Tip Top Trading is one of the fastest-growing companiesin London and…</li> 
  <li>above all… the reason I want this job is…</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Anna couldn’t remember the word ‘motivated’, so she just found another&nbsp;way of saying what she meant.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>I really, really want the job and I am willing to work very hard if I get it.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Nice work, Anna! Let's hope you get the chance to finish your interview&nbsp;next week!</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hold tight please! This is Anna, on a bus going to an interview for a job as a sales executive at Tip Top Trading – one of London's fastest growing companies. How are you feeling Anna?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh, a little nervous but I really want this job.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well don't worry Anna, as long as you say the right things, you'll be fine.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>The right things!? Like what?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>You need to sell yourself, be confident, not arrogant and give examples. Like: A good example that comes to mind. I'm particularly proud of. Timekeeping is important to me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh right. Thanks. Perhaps you can come with me?</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Sorry Anna, you're on your own now – but we'll be listening in. Look! You've just arrived. Good luck!</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Come in. Hello, I'm Paul, the Manager of Tip Top Trading. And you must be….?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>It's Anna.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Yes, very good. Thanks for coming. Now somewhere in this pile, I've got your CV…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Err, is that it there?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Oh yes, thanks Hannah. Your qualifications look impressive but what sales experience can you bring to our company?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I worked in a shop once.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong>: Ohhh Anna! Sell yourself. Give a good example!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna</strong>: Oh right…mmm….well a good example that comes to mind is when I was involved with a campaign to promote and sell a new range of clothes – I loved doing it and it was…</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise</strong>: Oh sorry, excuse me, here's your tea Paul.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul</strong>: Thanks Denise. Now Anna, it looks like you've achieved a lot during your time at university. Could you give me an example of good team working during your time there?</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Sorry! I forgot the sugar.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Thank you Denise.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Hmm, so you want an example? I was the treasurer of the debating society at university. That was OK I suppose.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Come on Anna. Be more enthusiastic – the debating society is exciting!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I mean… I'm particularly proud of how I organised the finances for the debating society. We had a very small budget and I had to make decisions on what to buy.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>I like it! &quot;I'm particularly proud of&quot; - Positive but not boasting. You're doing well.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Very impressive – so you're a good planner Anna! We like organised people here... ooops, silly me. I seemed to have spilt tea over your CV.</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Oh, do you need some help?</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Oh no…I'm sure it'll dry out… carry on please…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Also… timekeeping is important to me…</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>&quot;Timekeeping is important to me&quot; – that's good!</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>I always try to complete my work on time. At university I never handed my assignments in late.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>That's good to hear. We like punctuality here…</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Excuse me Paul. Sorry it's a bit late – but I thought you might like a biscuit with your tea.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Hmm thanks….oh lovely, custard creams… mmm. Now Hannah, finally I wanted to ask you what exactly made you apply for this job at this company?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Errrr… ooo… well. The reason I applied is….</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Yes, yes, yes Anna? Do you need a bit more time to think?</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Errr…mmm…</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>What's she going to say? How would you answer that? Join us next time to find out. Before we go, here's a reminder of some of the great lines Anna's used today… A good example that comes to mind I'm particularly proud of. Timekeeping is important to me.

"<p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Hi, I'm Neil. Thanks for joining me on English at Work - a new series of programmes set&nbsp;in an office, full of top tips to help you learn some useful business language which you&nbsp;could use in the workplace. In the next few minutes you can join me on an introductory tour around one of London's&nbsp;biggest imitation plastic fruit manufacturers, called Tip Top Trading. We're going to hear&nbsp;from some of the employees that work so hard to keep the business running smoothly. So come on then! Let's step into the office and eavesdrop on Tip Top Trading's possible&nbsp;newest recruit. I say 'possible' because she is still being interviewed for the job of Sales&nbsp;Executive…</p> 
 <p><strong>Anna<br /></strong>Firstly, this job is an ideal match for my skills and experience: I've spent&nbsp;several years working in sales and I get on with people easily. Well, I&nbsp;mean, apart from the ones I don't like of course! Secondly, I know Tip Top&nbsp;Trading is one of the fastest-growing companies in London, and I want to&nbsp;be part of that.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>That's absolutely right. Tip Top Trading is the fastest-growing company in&nbsp;the plastic fruits sector.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Well said, Anna! If she gets that job I'm sure she'll be an asset to the company. The decision is in the hands of Manager, Paul, who we heard there. He's a nice guy really, a little disorganised, but when things go wrong he's got to take charge…a bit like this…</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Yesterday was not a great day. Two clients came in with serious&nbsp;complaints. Mrs Kumquat received a delivery of imitation bananas that&nbsp;were purple – not very convincing, and Mr Lime ordered grapefruits, but&nbsp;got pineapples. Tom!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Yeah, listen...</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Were you responsible for these errors?</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>Well... yes, but -</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Look, mistakes happen. But it seems that Mrs Kumquat left our offices&nbsp;even angrier than when she came in and she says she will never use Tip&nbsp;Top Trading again!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>I tried my best.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Hmmm.</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Ah yes, Tom! I hadn't warned you about Tom, one of the company's top Sales&nbsp;Executives – he's good….</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>[on phone] Tom speaking. Yah! Frankie! So what's the latest, are we on?&nbsp;</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>…but his interpersonal skills need working on. Listen to this!</p> 
 <p><strong>Tom<br /></strong>My computer has crashed. I've lost my phone. And there's a big, BIG&nbsp;problem with my timetable. I have two meetings scheduled at the same&nbsp;time with two extremely important clients. I can't do them both at once!</p> 
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>See what I mean! Now, every office needs a good office assistant – and Tip Top Trading&nbsp;is no exception. It's got Denise, who's there to assist, organise and sometimes make the&nbsp;tea…</p> 
 <p><strong>Denise<br /></strong>Oh sorry excuse me, here's your tea Paul.</p> 
 <p><strong>Paul<br /></strong>Thanks Denise.</p>
