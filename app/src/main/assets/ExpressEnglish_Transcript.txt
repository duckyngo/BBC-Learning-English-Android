This week: Christmas gifts <br /> <br />  <b>Is it best to give or receive presents?</b> <br /><b>Here's what people in London said: </b><br />  I am a very generous person. It gives me a lot of satisfaction to <br />give people presents. <br /> <br />  It's not just about physical presents but there is the emotional <br />side of giving presents, being together, the satisfaction from <br />giving people presents and receiving presents. <br /> <br />  I think it is rewarding to give as well. To make someone else <br />happy is always a nice feeling if you care about them. <br /> <br />  Sometimes I think the giving is more fun. You pick something <br />that you think that's pretty perfect for someone. I think it's <br />always nice and exciting to watch their reaction when they see it. <br />So sometimes that's more fun than getting a gift yourself. <br /> <br /> <br />  <b>What's the worst gift you've ever received?</b> <br /> <br />  Probably socks or something, something really generic and <br />probably pulled out of their closet at the last minute.

This week: Television <br /> <br /><b> <br /></b> <br /><i>How important is television in your life?  <br /></i><b> <br />Here's what people in London said: <br /></b>Telly takes about 40% of my day - watching tel y, especially fashion and celebrities' <br />lives. It's important for me because after school and work and everything I can relax in <br />front of the tel y. Definitely unwinding, relaxing. <br /> <br /><i>Generally speaking, how do you feel about TV? <br /></i>Personally I don't watch that much TV, and when I do I kind of .watch the news and <br />stuff. I think TV has conjured up like a hyper-reality and when people watch it their <br />mind-set of things kind of changes. For instance fashion - women watch how women <br />are on TV and stuff and then they automatically feel that oh, they want to be that kind of <br />person, and things. I think that it has a negative effect - the negatives outweigh the <br />positives.<i> <br /></i> <br />General y speaking, I think TV is a great medium for communication. You've got things <br />like comedy, factual programmes, documentaries, art programmes and then things like <br />soap operas. It covers a broad range of interests and expression. <br /><b> <br />Now tell us:  <br /><i>How important is television in your life? <br /></b></i> <br />Join the online conversation at http://bbc.in/mXuk42 <br /> <br />Express English      <br />- bbclearningenglish.com 2011 <br />   <br /><hr>

She died when I was real y young and <br />it's just real y interesting to see her when she was around my age. <br /> <br />I think the most treasured photograph I have is standing outside, actual y, Abu Simbel. It <br />was very beautiful. To sort of stand next to something that is thousands of years old, to <br />see  the  sophistication  of  the  people  was  amazing  and  just  the  views  around.  It  was <br />quite remarkable. <br /> <br />It's one of me on a beach in the south of France, taken when I first met my partner.

This week: Awards. <br /><b> <br /></b> <br /><i>Who would you give an award to and why? </i><br /><b>Here's what people in London said:  </b><br />I think this would be my parents. Firstly, for them being always an inspiration to myself, <br />for motivating me to work hard to achieve my goals and for always supporting me in <br />good and bad times and being there for me whenever I need them. So definitely my <br />parents, my Mum and Dad. <br /> <br /><b>What kind of award would you give them, like an Oscar or something?</b> <br />There are so many ways you can award your parents, but probably I would award them <br />by just making them proud for who I became at the moment and for really aiming to <br />achieve all my goals and I think that would be the best reward for them. For them to be <br />proud of myself and be proud of my sisters. <br /> <br />I would like to give one to Nelson Mandela. His capacity to forgive - I think we can all <br />bring that into our own lives as wel . That's just a personal attribute out of his other <br />excellent leadership qualities. <br /> <br />I would give it posthumously to Gutenberg, for the invention of the printing press, <br />obviously. I think we can't even, begin to imagine a world without books and the transfer <br />of knowledge in the fashion that the printing press and the spread of books, that that <br />has basical y allowed. <br /> <br /><b>Who would you give an award to and why?</b> <br />Join the online conversation at http://bbc.in/jfu8aL  <br /> <br /><hr>
