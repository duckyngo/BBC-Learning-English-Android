"<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br /> Hello. It's time for English at University – we're following Mary through her first year of study abroad and helping her and you learn some useful phrases. University life is not <strong>all work and no play</strong> – it's about having fun too and today Mary needs some persuading to <strong>let her hair down</strong> – you know, relax and enjoy herself with some extracurricular activities. And someone who knows most about doing that is her roommate Abi… &nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Abi</strong><br /> Still studying Mary? You look glued to that desk.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Mary<br /></span></strong>Yes, I think I am. I'm just writing up my notes and then I've got to read Professor Not's new book… and then I’ve got to…</p>
 <p><strong><span>Abi<br /></span></strong>Blah blah blah! I don't know what you're saying. It really is time to <strong>chillax</strong>… have a break. Come on… you're coming with me.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br /> Phew! It's hot in here. Oh hello Professor and hello Sharon.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Prof. Not and Sharon<br /></span></strong>Hello, Mary.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Abi<br /></span></strong>Now, this is Bikram yoga – it'll keep you fit and help you lose weight. And that guy over there's quite fit too!</p>
 <p><strong><span>Sharon<br /></span></strong>I've lost a kilo in a month haven't I Robert… I mean-?</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not</strong><br /> Err - yes. It improves your mind too Mary.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Yoga teacher<br /></span></strong>Welcome everyone. Let's begin. Just follow me… first of all, stand straight and breathe deeply… in… out… hold it there… good… next stretch your arms out, then slowly bend to touch your toes.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Prof. Not<br /></span></strong>Oh no… I seemed to have pulled something in my back. Sharon, could you give me a hand…</p>
 <p><strong><span>Sharon<br /></span></strong>Oh - you've gone a funny colour. Oh, he's so heavy. Abi, could you give me a hand? Mary, can you call for help?</p>
 <p><strong><span>Mary<br /></span></strong>Yes of course… oh what should I do?</p>
 <p><strong><span>Narrator<br /></span></strong>You need to call the medical centre and tell them there's an emergency. Explain what's happened and ask for someone to come and help 'asap' – as soon as possible.&nbsp;Go on Mary, get calling!</p>
 <p><strong><span>Mary<br /></span></strong>Right ok. Yes hello. Is that the medical centre? Good. We have an emergency in the yoga class… in the sports hall. Professor Not has hurt his back and he needs help. Yes, he bent over and couldn't stand up again… I'll ask him. She says &quot;Does it hurt?&quot;</p>
 <p><strong><span>Prof. Not<br /></span></strong>Oww. Yes! When are they coming?</p>
 <p><strong><span>Mary<br /></span></strong>He says &quot;Yes&quot;. How long do you think you'll be? Really? Please could you come as soon as possible?</p>
 <p><strong><span>Sharon<br /></span></strong>Ask them what we should do until they get here.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Mary<br /></span></strong>Right, yes… Is there anything we can do before you arrive? Yes, aha, right. I'll do that. Thank you. Bye.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Sharon<br /></span></strong>What did they say?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>They said <strong>&quot;chill out&quot;</strong>&nbsp;– whatever that means!</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br /> Goodness. What a drama! It looks like Professor Not's attempt to unwind has gone too far - but luckily, help is on its way thanks to these phrases that Mary used…</p>
 <p><strong>We have an emergency in the yoga class. We need help.<br /></strong><strong>How long do you think you'll be?<br /></strong><strong>Please could you come as soon as possible?<br /></strong><strong>Is there anything we can do before you arrive?</strong></p>
 <p>You can practise these phrases, pick up a few more plus learn some top tips for studying in the UK on our website at bbclearningenglish.com. Right, let's see if help has arrived for Professor Not…</p>
 <p><strong><span>Sharon<br /></span></strong>You hold his feet and I'll hold his head and we'll get him into the ambulance.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Daniel<br /></span></strong>Oh hello do you need a hand? Oh, what's going on here then – and why are you all sweaty?</p>
 <p><strong><span>Sharon<br /></span></strong>Robert bent over too far…</p>
 <p><strong><span>Mary<br /></span></strong>…in yoga… Bikram yoga. He's hurt his back.</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel</strong><br /> Yoga! That's for girls isn't it?!</p>
 <p><strong><span>Mary<br /></span></strong>No! Abi, do you know what, I've really enjoyed myself today.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Abi<br /></span></strong>Good, feeling more relaxed I hope. So, are you going to join the yoga club then?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br /> Definitely.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Daniel&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></span></strong>How much is it to join exactly?</p>"
"<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br /> Hello. Welcome back to English at University – &nbsp;the series that follows Mary through her first year of study abroad and teaches her and us some useful phrases.</p>
 <p>It's the second term and students at the University of Studies settle down to some hard work. Mary's in a lecture, struggling to write down everything that Professor Not is trying to say…</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> …so this term, we're doing the module on marketing. Business and marketing go hand-in-hand. Any business in a marketplace is likely to be in competition with other firms offering similar products…</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Err… excuse me Professor… could you say that again please?</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not<br /></strong>… I said… any business in a marketplace…</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br /> No the bit before that… please. You're going a bit too fast for me.</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /> </strong>Having trouble Mary?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Yes. I'm trying to write down everything he says but I can't keep up.</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /> </strong>You can't write <em>everything</em> down – you need to take notes.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Notes?</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /> </strong>Just <strong>note down</strong> words, phrases, bits of information from the lecture – things that will help you remember what's been said. Ask for help if you're not sure what to do.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Yes, I think I will. Ermm, Professor… sorry to interrupt again… what you're saying is fascinating… but I want to remember it all… have you any guidance about how to take notes?</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not<br /></strong>Oh thank you Mary. Fascinating eh? Well just use a pen and a notebook…</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>But what should I write down?</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>I think you need one of these… a voice recorder… just record the whole thing, listen back to it later. Easy!</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not</strong><br /> Is it? Well, writing things down is probably more useful. It gives you a chance to ask for clarification. Now Mary, just <strong>jot down</strong> the important bits… I'll emphasise these bits in the lecture. I'll say something like 'this bit is useful to know…'.</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>You won't need to write much then! What? It was a joke!</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not<br /></strong>Hmm. Yes, well. Now, write down what I say in your own words – although if I quote someone, make sure you write it down <strong>word-for-word</strong>. And use words, abbreviations, symbols or even pictures to summarise what I say. If you miss something, leave a gap in your notes, and get the information from me later. Does that help?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /> </strong>Perfectly.</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not<br /></strong>Remember to read through your notes after the lecture, and of course, anything you do miss you can find in my new book 'Funny Business'.</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>That's been a useful lesson, hasn't it Mary? Note taking is an important skill to learn. If you're not sure where to start, ask for help using these phrases…</p>
 <p><strong>Could you say that again please?<br /></strong><strong>You're going a bit too fast for me.<br /></strong><strong>Have you any guidance about how to take notes?</strong></p>
 <p>And here's Professor Not's tips for taking notes…</p>
 <p><strong>Write down the important bits… I'll emphasise these bits in the lecture.<br /></strong><strong>Write down what I say in your own words – although if I quote someone, make sure you write it down word-for-word.<br /></strong><strong>Use words, abbreviations, symbols or even pictures to summarise what I say.

 <p><strong>Prof. Not<br /></strong>So that's all for today… must dash, I've got a yoga class to go to. We can discuss this further in your tutorial.</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>Oh no! Oh, I don't believe it.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Problem Daniel?</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>The batteries on my voice recorder have run out… so annoying… I don't suppose…</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Yes, you can copy my notes.</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /> </strong>Great. And maybe I could buy you a drink to say thank you.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Maybe, Daniel.</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br /> Hello. It's that time for English at University – the series that teaches some English phrases to help you through your first year of study abroad.</p>
 <p>The first term has finished and the Christmas holidays are about to begin. The students at the University of Studies are busy preparing to go home… except for one…</p>
 <p><strong><span>Abi<br /></span></strong>Oh I can't wait for my boyfriend to pick me up – it's going to be great just hanging around, doing nothing for three weeks – a bit like here really. Oh, are you not packing your bags Mary – you've got a long journey home haven't you?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br /> No. I haven't. I left it too late to book a flight home and now they're all sold out.</p>
 <p><strong>Abi</strong><br /> No! Well what are you going to do? It's Christmas, you can't spend it on your own.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br /> Don't worry. I'm allowed to stay here – and I can do some reading and studying and watch TV – anyway, I don't really do the <strong>festive</strong> thing…</p>
 <p><strong><span>Daniel<br /></span></strong>Only me. Hi Mary… Abi… so you heard about my feedback from Professor Not then?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br /> Yes. It wasn't great was it…</p>
 <p><strong>Abi<br /> </strong>Don't worry about that – they only say bad things to make you work harder. Anyway, Danny boy, what are doing for the <strong>Yuletide</strong> period?</p>
 <p><strong><span>Daniel<br /></span></strong>Going home to my Mum and Dad's of course... boring. I'm catching the train at two o'clock so though I'd come and say 'Happy Christmas'.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Abi<br /></span></strong>Hold on! You've got a spare bed at your parents' house, haven't you?</p>
 <p><strong><span>Daniel<br /></span></strong>Err yeah.</p>
 <p><strong>Abi</strong><br /> Perfect! Mary can't get a flight home for Christmas so she can go and stay at yours, can't she?!</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /> </strong>What? Really? Do you really want to come and stay with me… at Christmas?</p>
 <p><strong><span>Mary<br /></span></strong>Well, with your parents – if it's not too much trouble.</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /> </strong>Ace! I'll go and ring my Mum.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Abi<br /></span></strong>There you go Mary. Christmas is sorted – have a good one.</p>
 <p><strong>Mum<br /> </strong>Oh Mary it's so nice to meet you. Daniel's never brought a girl home before.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Daniel<br /></span></strong>Let's change the subject. Fancy pulling a <strong>cracker</strong> mum?</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br /> Mary, it's time to be polite, say how grateful you are but set the record straight – explain – about you and Daniel.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Mary<br /></span></strong>Yes, of course. Err, Mrs Smythe… I'm very touched that you've allowed me to stay with you. I'm really grateful to have somewhere to stay. You're such nice people to spend the holidays with.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Mum<br /></span></strong>Ooo Jim, doesn't she say such nice things. Daniel's really found a treasure here.</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /> </strong>Mum!</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /> </strong>Thank you. I'm very pleased to have Daniel as a good friend but I think there's been some confusion. Can I just make it clear… we're not together.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Daniel<br /></span></strong>No mum, we're not 'an item'. Just friends, like she said.</p>
 <p><strong>Mum<br /> </strong>Oh right… no wedding yet then. Ah well, you're still a lovely girl. Would you like to carve the <strong>turkey</strong>?</p>
 <p><strong><span>Narrator<br /></span></strong>Mrs Smythe seems to like you Mary. Well done for being polite and using these phrases…</p>
 <p><strong>I'm very touched that you've allowed me to stay with you.<br /></strong><strong>I'm really grateful to have somewhere to stay.<br /></strong><strong>You're such nice people to spend the holidays with.</strong></p>
 <p>You also told Daniel's mum you're not mad enough to be going out with her son! Here are some of the things you said to clear up any confusion…</p>
 <p><strong>I think there's been some confusion.<br /></strong><strong>Can I just make it clear… we're not together.</strong></p>

 <p>Now, Christmas Day is going well and it looks like there's another visitor…</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel</strong><br /> I'll get it…. Professor Not, Sharon… what are <em>you</em> doing here?!</p>
 <p><strong><span>Sharon<br /></span></strong>Hello!</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not<br /> </strong>Yes hello. A bit of a surprise I know. It's just… I tried to find Mary at the university but Abi said she'd come here… ah Mary… I wanted to say sorry for the confusion in our meeting last week and give you a Christmas <strong>present</strong>… so err, here you are…</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /> </strong>Gosh… thanks.</p>
 <p><strong>Mum<br /> </strong>Actually, me and Jim have bought you a little something too.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Sharon<br /></span></strong>And I've just made some <strong>mince pies</strong> to eat – but go on Mary, open your presents first.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Mary<br /></span></strong>Oh right. This is so kind of you all. Oh lovely Mr and Mrs Smythe, a woolly scarf and mittens – very useful. Oh wow! Professor, a book.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Prof. Not<br /></span></strong>Yes, it's my latest book 'Funny Business' – look I've signed it for you.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Mary<br /></span></strong>Thanks!</p>
 <p><strong><span>Daniel<br /></span></strong>Well as we're doing presents, you might as well open mine now… here you are.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Mary<br /></span></strong>Goodness… it's a small box… a lovely bow. It's a memory stick – with <em>my </em>name on it! That's brilliant – just what I wanted. Oh everybody, despite being a long way from home, it's been great being here – a real home from home.</p>
 <p><strong>Everyone</strong><br /><strong>Happy Christmas!</strong></p>
 <p><strong><span>Mum<br /></span></strong>So professor, Sharon would you like to stay for dinner?</p>
 <p><strong><span>Both<br /></span></strong>Oh yes please.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Narrator<br /></span></strong>Happy Christmas everyone. See you next term!</p>
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br /> Welcome back to English at University – the series that teaches some English phrases to help you through your first year at university. It's almost the end of Mary's first term at the University of Studies. She's settled in well and made some new friends but today's the day to find out how well her studying's going when she gets some feedback from Professor Not.</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not<br /></strong>Hello Mary. Take a seat… no, I mean sit down. So let's review your progress this term. How's it been?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br /> I think it's been…</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon<br /></strong>Sorry to interrupt. There's your tea… biscuits… I got you those chocolate ones you like … and the files you asked for… and I got those tickets for the show tonight OK?</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not<br /></strong>Err. Thank you Sharon. Could you errr… file those away for me please?</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon<br /></strong>Righty-ho.</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not<br /></strong>Now where was I? Ah yes – your term so far. How's it been?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Well. Very good… I think. I was a little homesick but everyone's been so supportive, especially Sharon.</p>
 <p><strong>Prof.Not</strong></p>
 <p>Oh yes, <strong>I concur</strong>, she's a real brick! Well that's good to hear. I know you've had to adapt to our strange British ways… and that might explain some of these notes I've written about you. Work – average, needs to work on expressing ideas more clearly… I'm a bit concerned about progress, maybe a little wet behind the ears… goodness, did I really write that?</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br /> <strong>I beg to differ</strong> Mary – I mean I don't agree. He can't be talking about you! I think you need to offer some feedback on his feedback and get him <strong>to see eye-to-eye</strong> with you.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I can't do that. He's the professor.</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>He may be in charge but he's not always right. You are entitled to say 'I find your comments &nbsp;a bit harsh', 'I feel I have put in 100 per cent effort this term' and 'what evidence do you have for your feedback?'. Try that and make it clear you think he's wrong – but be polite.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>It won't be easy but I'll try. Professor Not… I like you.</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not<br /></strong>Oh thank you.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I mean you are a good teacher and have been very helpful. As you know I feel I have put in 100 per cent effort this term…</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not<br /></strong><strong>I couldn't agree more</strong>.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>So I find your comments a bit harsh and a little unfair. I mean, what evidence do you have for your feedback?</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not<br /></strong>Err well… let's look at the mark for your assignment… shall we? It says here D minus. Hmm, is that right?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>D minus! No it can't be… I worked so hard… and…</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon<br /></strong>Sorry, more biscuits… what's going on and why is Mary crying? Robert, what have you done? Come on Mary, I'll make you a nice cup of tea.</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Oh dear. This feedback session hasn't gone to plan. Giving feedback is supposed to be a positive and useful experience but Professor Not seems to have gone too far by using these phrases…</p>
 <p><strong>Work is average.<br /></strong><strong>Needs to work on expressing ideas more clearly.<br /></strong><strong>I'm a bit concerned about your progress.<br /></strong><strong>A little wet behind the ears.</strong></p>
 <p>But Mary stood her ground with these phrases…</p>
 <p><strong>I feel I have put in 100 per cent effort this term.<br /></strong><strong>I find your comments a bit harsh.<br /></strong><strong>What evidence do you have for your feedback?</strong></p>
 <p>You can practise these phrases, pick up a few more plus learn some top tips for studying in the UK on our website at bbclearningenglish.com.&nbsp;Now, let's hope Sharon can explain Professor Not's comments and make him see sense.</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon<br /></strong>There's your tea. I know Robert... I mean Professor Not had a late night last night, maybe he got confused? Can you not just <strong>agree to disagree</strong>? Now let's have a look at these files… oh dear…</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>What is it Sharon?</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon<br /></strong>I seem to have given him the wrong file. He was reading the comments he'd written for Daniel Smythe. Ooopps.</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>Hello you two. Time for my feedback session with the old Prof. Can't wait to hear all the great things he's got to say about me. It's been such a brilliant term.</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon</strong><br /> Errr… you'd better go in.</p>
 "
"<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br /> Welcome back to English at University - the series that teaches some English phrases to help you through your first year at university.&nbsp;<br />Mary's trying to get hold of her assignment which is saved on Daniel's memory stick – it was in his trouser pocket. Not anymore and the hunt is now on to find it.</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel&nbsp;<br /></strong>Now I put it in my pocket here and walked over there and through the door…</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>You should be more careful. Goodness you've got stuff <strong>all</strong> <strong>over the place</strong>!</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>It may look <strong>chaotic</strong> but I'm sure it's here somewhere. It's got my name on it. Oh it's no good - you'll have to go to the lost property office and see if it's in there.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Me?</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>Well I'll carry on looking for it in here.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just go down the corridor, turn left and then right, the office is behind the student union. Just tell them 'I've lost a memory stick' or something.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oh, ok. See you later.</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Err Mary – don't be too <strong>hasty</strong>. You can't just say 'I've lost a memory stick' or something – he hasn't got a clue!<br />When you get to the lost property office, just say 'I wonder if you can help me please? &nbsp;I'm looking for a memory stick that I lost earlier.' And 'has anyone handed in a memory stick today?'</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>And if they haven't got it?</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Say that you would like them to let you know if gets handed in.&nbsp; Give them your details and hopefully it will turn up – it'll be found. Look you're here now…</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>OK thanks.</p>
 <p><strong>Caretaker<br /></strong>Yes?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Err, hello. I've… lost something.</p>
 <p><strong>Caretaker<br /></strong>Good… I mean, good you're in the right place – the LOST property office.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Right. Good. Well. I wonder if you can help me please? Earlier today I… well, my friend… lost a memory stick somewhere on the university campus.</p>
 <p><strong>Caretaker<br /></strong>Memory stick? We've got thousands of those.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oh I see. I wonder… has anyone handed in <em>my</em> memory stick… a black one, with the name Daniel Smythe written on it? It's very precious to me.</p>
 <p><strong>Caretaker<br /></strong>What, the memory stick or Daniel Smythe?! Look, I'll see what we've got. Nope, nothing there. Sorry.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oh no. Well, if somebody hands it in, please can you let me know? Here are my contact details.</p>
 <p><strong>Caretaker<br /></strong>Alright but I don't think there's much chance of it turning up.</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Oh dear Mary. Things aren't looking good. Daniel's organisational skills seem a bit <strong>haphazard</strong>. In future, don't trust Daniel with anything valuable. Anyway, you've done your best trying to find that memory stick by using these phrases…</p>
 <p><strong>I wonder if you can help me please?<br /></strong><strong>Has anyone handed in my memory stick?<br /></strong><strong>If somebody hands it in, please can you let me know?<br /></strong><strong>Here are my contact details.</strong></p>
 <p>You can practise these phrases, pick up a few more plus learn some top tips for studying in the UK on our website at bbclearningenglish.com.<br />Never mind Mary, I'm sure it will turn up – but now it's time to do some washing at the laundrette…</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>I've searched everywhere and I just don't know what's happened to it… anyway how do you use these stupid washing machines?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>The clothes go in there… the money goes in there… and the powder goes there. Is this the first wash you've done this term?</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>It's the first wash I've ever done - my mum usually does my washing. Hold on, what's this at the bottom? The memory stick! It was wrapped up in with my dirty pants!</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Yuk! You'd better get those in the machine and I'll get that to Professor Not as soon as possible.</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Crisis averted!</p>
 "
"<p><strong><span>Narrator<br /></span></strong>Welcome back to English at University where we're following Mary's first year of study abroad and helping with some useful words and phrases. The new Business Studies students have been busy working on their first assignment and now the deadline is approaching to hand them in. Will they all complete their work on time? I'm sure you have Mary!</p>
 <p><strong><span>Mary<br /></span></strong>Me? Yes. Once I got my laptop problem fixed I saved my work onto that memory stick... oh no!</p>
 <p><strong><span>Narrator<br /></span></strong>What's wrong?</p>
 <p><strong><span>Mary<br /></span></strong>Daniel's got the memory stick. I must go and find him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /> </strong>Good luck!</p>
 <p><strong>Prof.Not</strong><br /> Hello Mary! Looking forward to reading that assignment of yours. Don't forget to email me by the end of the day.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /> </strong>Yes... yes of course you'll get it tonight.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong><span>Prof.Not<br /></span></strong>Good. Don't forget it counts towards 20 per cent of your final exam mark. See you later.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /> </strong>Really! Now where is Daniel when you need him?</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /> </strong>Yes, where is he? If you can't find him you're going to miss the deadline – may I suggest you ask for an extension. An extra period of time to get your work finished. You need to apologise to Sharon and say 'I'm having problems meeting the deadline for my assignment' and try to <strong>talk her round</strong> so that she gives you a bit more time.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /> </strong>But I've done my work.</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br /> We know that - but you haven't got it with you to hand in. So make sure you explain everything to Sharon and <strong>reassure</strong> her you'll get it sorted – but remember you don't get extensions for any old reason.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /> </strong>Ok thanks. I'll go and see her now.</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon </strong><br /> Oh cheeky. Well we'll do it again if you... oh hello Mary. I'll call you back. How are things?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /> </strong>Good, ok, bad really. I can't find Daniel... he's got my assignment... well… it's saved on his memory stick.</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon</strong><br /> Left it in his room did you?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /> </strong>No! Nothing like that. I've got to email it to Professor Not today and I can't find it... so I was wondering... well, 'I'm having problems meeting the deadline for my assignment… so is it possible to get an extension for my assignment - please?</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon<br /> </strong>We can't hand out extensions willy-nilly.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /> </strong>I have a very good reason for asking. I mean, it's written, it's just I can't find it.</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon<br /> </strong>Hmmm.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /> </strong><span>If I could have just one more day before I hand it in, I'd be most grateful?<br /></span>It won't happen again. Please?</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon<br /> </strong>Look, I'm seeing Robert... I mean Professor Not… this evening to go over some documents... and I could put in a good word for you... that means say you're hard working, normally reliable and you won't do it again. OK?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /> </strong>Sharon, you are amazing!</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon<br /> </strong>Ooo, nobody's ever called me that before!</p>
 <p><strong><span>Narrator<br /></span></strong>Phew!&nbsp; It looks like Mary has managed to <strong>sweet talk</strong> Sharon into getting a deadline extension – but she had to be polite and humble. Here's a reminder of some of the phrases she used…</p>
 <p><strong>I'm having problems meeting the deadline for my assignment</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Is it possible to get an extension for my assignment please?</strong></p>
 <p><strong>I have a very good reason for asking.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>If I could have just one more day before I hand it in, I'd be most grateful.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>It won't happen again.</strong></p>
 <p>You can practise these phrases, pick up a few more plus learn some top tips for studying in the UK on our website at bbclearningenglish.com.&nbsp;All Mary needs to do now is find Daniel and get hold of that memory stick.</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /> </strong>Ah Mary, there you are – I've been looking all over the place for you.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Mary<br /></span></strong>Me too! I need that memory stick – it's got my assignment saved on it. Daniel – I had to go and ask Sharon for extra time to hand it in.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Daniel<br /></span></strong>You managed to <strong>win her over</strong> did you! Well don't worry, I've got it here in my… my… oh no… it's gone… I must have dropped it.</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br /> Hello. It's time again for English at University - the series that teaches some English phrases to help you through your first year of study abroad. Mary's been set some work – to write an assignment about business. Always <strong>studious</strong> and keen to do well, she's getting on with it in the peace and quiet of the library.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong><span>Mary<br /></span></strong>…so good business needs a good plan. Hmmm.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Daniel<br /></span></strong>Oh hi Mary. <strong>Beavering away</strong>?</p>
 <p><strong><span>Mary<br /></span></strong>Hello Daniel. Well we have got an assignment to write.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Daniel<br /></span></strong>Yeah but we've still got three days and I work best when the pressure's on. Blimey, your laptop's a bit ancient isn't it?&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br /> It's a new one actually and it does me just fine. Look at what I've done so far… oh no!</p>
 <p>It's frozen. If I push the arrow here nothing moves. Oh dear and I haven't saved it yet.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Daniel<br /></span></strong>Proved my point eh? I've got one of those Macpad Fabs – brilliant – fast processor, huge memory, almost does the assignment for you. Anyway, look what you've got to do is just reboot – press this button here… wait a few seconds and ….</p>
 <p><strong><span>Mary<br /></span></strong>Nothing. Everything's disappeared! Daniel, what have you done?</p>
 <p><strong><span>Narrator<br /></span></strong>What has he done indeed? Idiot! You've been so <strong>diligent</strong> – you've worked hard – to get this assignment done, I think you're going to need some help to get it back.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Mary<br /></span></strong>I know. But I know nothing about technology, what questions should I ask?</p>
 <p><strong><span>Narrator<br /></span></strong>Don't panic. You need to find someone who knows a bit about technology and say 'I seem to have lost my work, what can I do?' or 'do you think you can restore my work please?', or say 'I turned my computer off and didn't back up my work, is there anything you can do?' – even if it was Daniel's fault. Go and see if you can get some help.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Mary<br /></span></strong>OK, I will. Oh look, there's that technology student over there. I'll ask him.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Daniel<br /></span></strong>I don't think he's going to know what to do…</p>
 <p><strong><span>Mary<br /></span></strong>…excuse me. Do you remember me from the Study Skills session?</p>
 <p><strong><span>Tech Student<br /></span></strong>Oh, yes I do. I never forget anyone who uses an Acorn Fastbook 5.4 laptop.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Mary<br /></span></strong>Yes, good. Well I've got a problem… Daniel has turned off my laptop and I seem to have lost my work, what can I do?</p>
 <p><strong><span>Daniel<br /></span></strong>I was just trying to reboot it.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Tech Student<br /></span></strong>Hmm. That's a silly thing to do. Let me have a look.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Mary<br /></span></strong>Thanks. Do you think you can restore my work?</p>
 <p><strong><span>Tech Student<br /></span></strong>Did you back up your work?</p>
 <p><strong><span>Mary<br /></span></strong>Err well no, not before I… I mean Daniel, switched it off. Is there anything you can do?</p>
 <p><strong><span>Tech Student<br /></span></strong>Oh dear. Well if I do this… ah there bingo! Luckily it was saved on the laptop memory. An impressive 24 gigabytes of RAM in fact. I'd advise you to back it up onto this memory stick.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Daniel<br /></span></strong>It's alright mate, she can use mine.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Mary<br /></span></strong>Thanks so much err?</p>
 <p><strong><span>Tech Student<br /></span></strong>Malcolm. You're welcome. How about having a drink tonight?</p>
 <p><strong><span>Mary<br /></span></strong>Sorry I can't. I've got to study.</p>
 <p><strong><span>Narrator<br /></span></strong>Well done Malcolm and well done Mary for asking for help. You got yourself out of a tricky situation by asking these questions…</p>
 <p><strong>I seem to have lost my work, what can I do?<br /></strong><strong>Do you think you can restore my work please?<br /></strong><strong>Is there anything you do?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>You can practise these phrases, pick up a few more plus learn some top tips for studying in the UK on our website at bbclearningenglish.com. So two days later, and Mary has been working <strong>in earnest</strong> to complete her assignment and now she's finished, it looks like somebody else needs some help…&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong><span>Daniel<br /></span></strong>Mary, Mary… my laptop's broken and I haven't even started my assignment!</p>
 <p><strong><span>Mary<br /></span></strong>Your 'Macpad Fab'?</p>
 <p><strong><span>Daniel<br /></span></strong>Yeah. Don't know what's happened but it won't turn on. I couldn't borrow yours could I… and that memory stick I lent you?</p>
 <p><strong><span>Mary<br /></span></strong>OK - just to help a friend. But look after it and remember to back up your work!&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong><span>Daniel<br /></span></strong>Yeah of course. Why wouldn't I? You sure you won't need it tonight?</p>
 <p><strong><span>Mary<br /></span></strong>No, sure go ahead. I'm going for a drink with Malcolm tonight.</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br /> Hello. It's time for English at University - the series that teaches some English phrases to help you through your first year of study abroad.</p>
 <p>There's a lot to learn when you start studying for a degree and especially when you're doing it in another country. Mary's coping very well and is making the most of every opportunity to get <strong>guidance</strong> or help her with her studies. Today she's attending Professor Not's study skills workshop but it sounds like she knows more about studying than he does!</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not<br /></strong>…so let's just stand around in a circle… hold hands and say mmmmm.</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>How exactly is this helping?&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not<br /></strong>Trust you to spoil the karma. It just helps us think…</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>Think of what to say, you mean.</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not<br /></strong>Now to study well, you need to be in the right zone.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Zone?</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not<br /></strong>In the right place… in your head. Sharon…</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon<br /></strong>Yes Robert - I mean, Professor.</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not<br /></strong>Could you hand out the blindfolds?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>And how are they going to help?</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>A good question Mary. I admire Professor Not's enthusiasm but let <strong>me give you a bit of advice</strong> – his study skills are a bit 'alternative' - different. Have you got any advice to offer?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Well, I did read a book about good study skills on the plane. But what do I say?</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Say 'could I offer some suggestions?' or 'from what I understand…' or maybe, 'something that works for me is…' and give them your tips – that way you won't sound too big-headed – like someone we know!</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>Maybe we could just hold the hand of the person next to us?&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br /> Go on Mary.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>No Daniel… maybe I could offer some suggestions?&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon<br /></strong>Oh yes Mary!</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Well… from what I understand… you must study every day… and choose a regular place and time to do it.</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not<br /></strong>Yes of course, very good Mary. Anything else?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Well… what works for me is planning my time and deciding what I want to achieve… and not being afraid to ask for help.</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel</strong><br /> Yeah, yeah. I was going to say that – and make sure you take lots of breaks – long ones.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br /> Short ones – and develop a good learning style – choose a method that helps you learn best.</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not</strong><br /> Excellent Mary. That's exactly right.</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon<br /></strong>Oh, I preferred the blindfold method.</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Excellent indeed Mary. She's on fire! She spoke up and gave some <strong>sage advice</strong> without showing off. Here's a reminder of how she started the conversation…</p>
 <p><strong>Maybe I could offer some suggestions?</strong></p>
 <p><strong>From what I understand…</strong></p>
 <p><strong>What works for me is…</strong>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And she gave some good advice which the other students – especially Daniel - will no doubt find very useful, such as…</p>
 <p><strong>You must study every day</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Choose a place and time to do it</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Plan your time and decide what you want to achieve</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Don't be afraid to ask for help</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Choose a learning style that helps you learn best</strong></p>
 <p>With that advice you can't go wrong. And now it looks like Mary's study advice has made a real impression on someone…</p>
 <p><strong>Tech Student</strong><br /> Wow Mary. I loved what you said in there – really useful – I can see you're a committed student – how about getting together sometime and… comparing study notes?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br /> Well, errr, ermm…</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>I think she's quite busy at the moment.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>No, I'm not – that would be lovely. Let's meet up in the bar later.</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon</strong><br /> Ooooh!&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br /> Hello and welcome to English at University - the series that teaches some English phrases to help you through your first year of study abroad.</p>
 <p>Mary's come to the UK to study Business at the University of Studies – she's learning about student life but she hasn't learnt much about business yet – however she's about to go to her second lecture, so all that might change….</p>
 <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Prof.Not<br /></span></strong>…so business really is the life blood of the economy – and we can read more about that in my book. Anyway, the subject of your first assignment…</p>
 <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Mary<br /></span></strong>What's an assignment?&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel <br /> </strong>It's a piece of work- like an essay – you have to do as part of your studies. I love assignments: I'm always very good at them.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Prof. Not<br /></span></strong>…Daniel, can you pay attention please. This is very important – your assignment can be quite short or very long and it's about business and what-not. Type it out and send it to me – easy really.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Narrator<br /></span></strong>Oh dear. It's <strong>easier said than done</strong>. He's not very clear about what he wants. Are you confused Mary?</p>
 <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Mary<br /></span></strong>I am a bit. Quite short, very long, 'business and what-not'… what exactly does he want?</p>
 <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Narrator<br /></span></strong>It's time to ask for clarification. You need to ask him how many words he wants and how it should be presented. How he wants it delivered and most importantly – when's the deadline? Get those details right and you're on your way to preparing your first assignment.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br /> Right – got it – clarification. Professor…&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not</strong><br /> Mary?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br /> I need some more details before I begin my assignment please. I really need to know the theme of the assignment…</p>
 <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Daniel<br /></span></strong>Duh! Obvious! It's about techniques for good business - is it not?</p>
 <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Prof.Not<br /></span></strong>Professor Not to you – and no, I think the question is 'Why is business the life-blood of the economy?' So just write something about that…</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /> </strong>Yes… but how many words do you want… how would you like it presented – text, photos, graphs?</p>
 <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Prof. Not<br /></span></strong>Yes Mary, all that kind of stuff. And hmmm, <strong>I'm easy</strong> - shall we say 2,000 words? We can meet later if you need more help…</p>
 <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Mary<br /></span></strong>It's OK - just let me know how we should deliver it to you when it's finished.</p>
 <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Prof. Not<br /></span></strong>You can drop it round to my house if you like.</p>
 <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Daniel<br /></span></strong>Oh really… what's your address?<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Prof. Not<br /></span></strong>On second thoughts, just email it to me. My (email) address is on the board.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /> </strong>But how long have we got… I mean, when is the deadline for completing our assignment?</p>
 <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Prof. Not<br /></span></strong>Errr, how about midnight, two weeks tomorrow? Must dash, I've got a - errr…. a meeting.</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br /> Good work Mary. Hopefully you're much clearer about what's expected from you for your first assignment. You <strong>effortlessly</strong> managed to ask for some specific information by using these questions…</p>
 <p><strong>I need some more details before I begin my assignment please. </strong></p>
 <p><strong>I really need to know the theme of the assignment.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>How many words do you want?&nbsp; </strong></p>
 <p><strong>How would you like it presented?</strong></p>
 <p><strong>How should we deliver it to you when it's finished?</strong></p>

 <p>So now there's some real work to be done, who's going to get started first? I think we know who!</p>
 <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Daniel<br /></span></strong>This assignment should be <strong>a cinch</strong> – you know, easy!<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Mary<br /></span></strong>Time to head to the library then.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Daniel<br /></span></strong>Really, already… I was wondering if you'd like to… err… go for a coffee, get to know each other… that kind of stuff?</p>
 <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Mary<br /></span></strong>OK that's a nice idea… Oh hello Professor… oh, hello Sharon…</p>
 <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Sharon<br /></span></strong>Oh hello sweetheart.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Prof. Not<br /></span></strong>Sorry about rushing off. I meant to say, I'm doing a workshop on study skills in fifteen minutes… in the library… if you're interested?&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br /> Oh yes, I'll definitely be there. Are you coming, Daniel?</p>
 <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Daniel<br /></span></strong>Yeah, suppose so. I don't like coffee anyway.</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br /> Welcome back to English at University - the series that teaches some English phrases to help you through your first year of study abroad. It's the most important time of the day – dinner time – time for some <strong>grub</strong> – I mean food - and Mary's gone to the canteen with Abi but Mary's hasn't quite worked out the system for getting what she wants.</p>
 <p><strong>Abi<br /></strong>…some of that… and some of that… ooo, and a bit of that…</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Gosh, that's a lot of food Abi.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Abi</strong><br /> Yeah but you can eat as much as you like here – it's the same price – so go on, <strong>fill your boots</strong>! I'll see you over at the table.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br /> Fill my boots?</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>She means eat a lot! Abi may be <strong>pigging out</strong> on lots of food but you don't have to. Do you need some help Mary?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br /> Yes please. I can't remember where anything is – and I'm a vegetarian but the food labels are so confusing.</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br /> Don't worry. Before you <strong>tuck in to</strong> a vegetarian meal, just ask 'can you tell me which food is suitable for vegetarians?' or 'has this got meat in it?' and then when you want to find stuff like the cutlery – the knives and forks – just ask 'where can I find…' or 'do you have any…?' Go on give it a go.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>OK then. Excuse me, can you tell me if you have any food suitable for vegetarians… please? &nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Dinner lady<br /></strong>Dunno… &nbsp;have we got any veggie stuff? Well there's the spaghetti bolognaise over there.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Ermm… has that got meat in it?</p>
 <p><strong>Dinner lady<br /></strong>Well a little bit.</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not<br /></strong>Hi Mary…&nbsp; looking for something veggie? I'd recommend the lentil dal over there… delicious… a real taste of Asia.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br /> Thanks Professor. But what are you doing here?</p>
 <p><strong>Prof.Not</strong><br /> Well err… my wife… Mrs Not… likes me to eat out sometimes… since I… err…not to worry.</p>
 <p><strong>Dinner lady<br /></strong>Right, anything else? I just need your meal ticket. No… that's a blue one… for breakfast… you need a red one for dinner.</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not</strong><br /> Allow me… I have a spare ticket… there you go.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br /> Thanks. Now, where do I find the knives and forks?</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not</strong><br /> Just over here…. Oh no, it's that idiot Daniel.</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>Hello Mary… Professor Not… can I join you, tell you about my business idea?&nbsp; I got the idea from your book…. look…&nbsp; ooops…</p>
 <p><strong>Prof.Not<br /></strong>Idiot! Now I have lentil dal all over my suit – what will Mrs Not say?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br /> Oh dear. Excuse me, do you have any serviettes?</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br /> What a mess! Daniel has certainly left his mark on Professor Not but at least Mary has managed to find her way around the canteen. Here are some of the phrases she used…</p>
 <p><strong>Excuse me, can you tell me if you have any food suitable for vegetarians please?&nbsp; </strong></p>
 <p><strong>Has this got meat in it?</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Where can I find…?</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Do you have any…?</strong></p>

 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>So sorry about that… if I just scrape this bit off… err you'll be fine.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Prof.Not<br /> </strong>So what was your 'business idea'? Dry cleaning perhaps?</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>No… it was an idea to…<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Prof.Not<br /></strong>Never mind. See you at tomorrow's lecture. It starts at 10am sharp. Goodbye.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /> </strong>Oh dear Daniel. Would you like to share my food?!&nbsp;</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br /> Hello and welcome to English at University - the series that teaches some English phrases to help you through your first year of study abroad. <br />New student Mary is settling into university life but still hasn't visited the most important place you'll need to go to, to help you with your studies. It's a great place for a <strong>bookworm</strong> like Mary – it's the library. So Mary, have you got your library card with you?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Yes, I've got it thanks.</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>And your reading list – the list of books you need to read for this year's course?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I've got it here… I just need to find the books now. Ah, here I am now – The Library.</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon<br /></strong>Next…</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Sharon! Do you work here <em>as well</em>?</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon<br /></strong>Yes, we tend to double up round here. It's the funding cuts – the university's not got that much money – anyway dear, I suppose you're looking for some books?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Yes, that's right. Where can I find books about business please?</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon<br /></strong>Down there, turn left, then right, then to the end… under 'B'… B for biology…</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>and 'Business'. Thanks.<br />Oh no… oh dear… none of the books I need are here!</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Oh dear Mary. A <strong>bibliophile</strong> like you – someone who loves reading - needs to get to the library early if you want to get the books you need - but don't worry, I'm sure you can reserve them.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Reserve them? But what do I say?</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Go and ask Sharon to check if she has your books in stock – and if not ask if she can reserve them for you – and see if she can put them by for you… that means keep them for a period of time until you can collect them…</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>OK, I'll do just that. Thanks.</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon<br /></strong>Next! Oh it's you again… any luck?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>No, I'm afraid not. I can't find anything. Please could you check if you have any of these in stock.</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon<br /></strong>No… no… no. Sorry, no. It looks like a DANIEL SMYTHE has them all out at the moment.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oh dear. Well, perhaps you could reserve them for me please?</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon<br /></strong>Of course dear.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>OK. So could you put them by for me when they come in please?</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon<br /></strong>Certainly dear. We'll send you an email when they're back in.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>…and when do you think they will be available?</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon<br /></strong>Let's have a look… three weeks' time.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Three weeks? That's too late! I need them for my studies.</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Don't panic Mary, I'm sure we'll find a solution. But well done for trying to get hold of those important course text books. You've managed to ask for help and at least reserve the books you need, using these useful phrases…</p>
 <p><strong>Please could you check if you have any of these books in stock?</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Could reserve them for me please?</strong></p>

 <p><strong>Abi<br /></strong>Oh hi Mary. Something on your mind?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Yes, all the text books I need have been taken out of the library.</p>
 <p><strong>Abi<br /></strong>Oh never mind, there's never time to read those <em>boring</em> books anyway… but hold on… I think I did buy some of them when I was in the first year… let's have a look… there, how about this one?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>'Mind Your Own Business'! – yes, that's one of them – it looks almost new. Thanks Abi!</p>
 <p><strong>Abi<br /></strong>Don't mention it. I don't think I ever read it. You can keep it. Now come on, it's time to eat.</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br /> It's time for English at University - the series that teaches some English phrases to help you through your first year of study abroad. Mary's had her first Business Studies lecture and now she's decided to go to Professor Not's evening seminar - that's when a group of students meet with their teacher to discuss what they've learnt. But the problem is there's always <strong>a chatterbox</strong> - you know, someone who likes to do <em>all</em> the talking...</p>
 <p><strong>Prof Not<br /></strong>So glad you could make my seminar Mary... although I don't know where everyone else is... maybe it's the rain.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>...well, it is quite wet out there...</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon<br /></strong>...there you go Robert - red wine for you and - oh, hello... it's Mary isn't it?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>What are you doing here - I thought you just did administration?</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon</strong><br /> I do... but Robert, I mean Professor Not, likes help with his spreadsheets and photocopying and stuff.</p>
 <p><strong>Prof Not </strong><br /> Yes, I give you a lift home after the seminar - as you live round the corner from me.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oh right, I didn't know...</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon</strong><br /> ...anyway, don't mind me. I'll just sit here while you chat about clever things like business - is it just you tonight Mary?</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>I'm not too late am I... you did say eight o'clock?</p>
 <p><strong>Prof Not</strong> <br /> Yes I did - come and sit down... no, not on my books... just there. Have you met Sharon?</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon</strong><br /> Hello!</p>
 <p><strong>Prof Not</strong><br /> So, let's begin shall we. Now I talked about business being an economic system, but what do we mean by 'system'?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br /> I think...&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel</strong><br /> Well, obviously a system is a thing... you know...</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br /> But...</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel</strong><br /> And 'economic' is about... the economy. Yeah?</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Daniel - <strong>put a sock in it</strong>! You can't <strong>get a word in edgeways</strong> with him around. Mary, don't let him dominate the conversation - he needs to <strong>pipe down</strong> and you need to speak up - be polite but firm and say you want a chance to speak...</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oh right, if I must. Daniel - would you mind if I had a chance to speak please?</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>Oh right... yeah, of course... I was just explaining that economics is...</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /> </strong>I know... but I would like to say something too, if you don't mind.</p>
 <p><strong>Prof Not<br /></strong>Exactly. I think Mary should give us her views - so Daniel...&nbsp;<strong>zip it</strong>... please.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /> </strong>Thank you for giving me the chance to speak. I'd like to contribute to the discussion and say that to be in business you need something to sell.</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon<br /></strong>Oh, that's very good Mary.</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br /> Excellent Mary - very impressive. Once Daniel stopped <strong>talking your ears off</strong>, you finally got a chance to express yourself with the help of these useful phrases...</p>
 <p><strong>Would you mind if I had a chance to speak please?<br /></strong><strong>I would like to say something too, if you don't mind.<br /></strong><strong>Thank you for giving me the chance to speak.<br /></strong><strong>I'd like to contribute to the discussion please.</strong></p>

 <p><strong>Prof Not</strong><br /> ...so I think you'll find some useful stuff in my book 'Mind Your Own Business' - but we'll call it a day for now - I'll see you at my next lecture.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary/Daniel<br /></strong>Oh yes... thank you... it's all very interesting.</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon<br /></strong>Oh look at the rain out there - it's pouring. Still giving me a lift home Robert, hmmm?</p>
 <p><strong>Prof Not<br /></strong>Yes, yes, of course - maybe I could drop you off on the way home too Mary?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>If it's not too much trouble...&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Prof Not<br /></strong>Of course not Mary. But sorry Daniel, it's quite a small car so I don't think we'll fit you in.</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>Oh, oh ok. I like walking.</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br /> Hello and welcome to English at University - the series that teaches some English phrases to help you through your first year of study abroad. Mary's a new student who has just arrived at the University of Studies and now after settling in, her studying can finally begin.</p>
 <p>Mary, it's time for your first lecture - but you look like <strong>a bundle of nerves</strong>...</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>...well I am a bit <strong>nervous</strong>, I couldn't sleep last night.</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Don't worry, you're not alone - everyone's in the same position. Everything will be fine - good luck!</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>OK, well it's time to go in...</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not<br /></strong>Ah Mary - we meet again. How's your head today?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Better thanks - I see you managed to err... clean your shoes.</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not<br /> </strong>Yes, I did - they still smell a bit but I'll survive. Shall we get down to business - Business Studies - now that <em>most</em> of us are here?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /> </strong>Yes, of course.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /> </strong>Oh... err... sorry I'm late. I went to the wrong room.</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not<br /></strong>Hmmm... the first rule of business is punctuality. As T.C. Haliburton once said &quot;Punctuality is the soul of business.&quot; Now, what is business and why do we study it? Business is an economic system... A company transacts business activities...</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Daniel, what's he talking about?</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel</strong><br /> Haven't a clue... have you got a spare pen by the way? &nbsp;Look, you're going to have to ask him to explain.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br /> Me!?</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not</strong><br /> What was that Mary?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br /> Oh, nothing. Sorry.</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /> </strong>I think Daniel's <strong>a nervous wreck</strong> - he's not going to help you so I will! &nbsp;If something doesn't make sense, put your hand up and say 'excuse me, could you say that again please?' or 'I don't understand, can you explain that again please?' - or maybe 'could you explain that in a different way please?'</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>OK.</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not<br /></strong>Errr, yes Mary, what is it?&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /> </strong>Prof. Not... it's all very interesting but could you say that again please? Sorry, I don't understand what you mean...</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not</strong><br /> Oh!</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br /> I'd appreciate it if you could explain it in a different way... please?</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>I think what Professor Not means is you have to have a soul to be in business.</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not<br /></strong>No... Daniel isn't it? What I mean is...</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br /> Daniel's <strong>got a nerve</strong>, pretending he knows it all - perhaps it's just <strong>nervous energy</strong> that makes him such an idiot! Anyway, well done Mary - you spoke up and asked for clarification. It's a good idea to ask if you don't understand something. Don't pretend you know something when you don't - like Daniel did! Here's a reminder of the questions Mary asked...&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Could you say that again please?</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Sorry, I don't understand what you mean.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Could you explain that in a different way please?<br /> </strong></p>
 <p>You can practise these phrases, pick up a few more plus learn some top tips for studying in the UK on our website at bbclearningenglish.com. Now, the lecture is over, I wonder if things are a bit clearer for Mary?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br /> Thanks Professor. Everything's much clearer now.</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not<br /></strong>Well I recommend you get my book from the library - 'Mind Your Own Business' - oh and Mary... I hold a seminar every Monday at the local pub should you wish to join us sometime?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br /> Yes Professor... thanks, I will.</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not</strong><br /> You can call me Robert.</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel</strong><br /> Ok Robert! It's a date!</p>
 <p><strong>Prof. Not</strong><br /> Oh, it's you. Well, don't forget to bring your notes.</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel</strong><br /> Oh no, my notes! I left them in the classroom.</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />It's time again for English at University - the series that teaches some English phrases to help you through your first year of study abroad. Mary's met her new roommate Abi and is settling in well. But before her lectures finally begin there's some admin to do…</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Admin?</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Administration – paperwork – you need to go to registration and complete some forms. Oh and don't forget to pick up your student card – that will be very useful.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Oh ok. Thanks. I'll do that now.</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon</strong><br />Next.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Oh, hello. I'm Mary. I'm new.</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon</strong><br />So is everyone else – you've come to register have you?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />I think so. I think I need to fill in some forms.</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon</strong><br />Oh yes, lots of them. Here you go… next!</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />She's not very friendly – but it's a good idea to keep in with the administration assistant – she can help you with lots of things. Do you need help now Mary?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Oh yes I do. Look at all this paper… this one asks for D-O-B and this one says plagiarism declaration.</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Don't panic. Be polite and ask for help. Say something like… I'm really sorry but I'm not sure what to write, or, could you explain this form to me please, or, I know you're busy but I'd be grateful if you could help me. Give it a go – I'm sure she won't bite your head off.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Bite my head off?! I hope not. Right… I know you're really busy but I'd be grateful if you could help me. Please?</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon</strong><br />Yes of course dear… this is a 'plagiarism declaration' which says that you won't copy anyone's work… just sign it here. This is a form with your important contact details and next-of-kin… that's the person we'll contact if you get ill or die or something.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />And this?</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon</strong><br />Oh don't forget this one. Fill this in and you'll get a student card – that'll give you discounts on books and food and get you into the student nightclub. You'll need to include a photograph of yourself.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Oh great. Thanks so much…err?</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon</strong><br />Sharon.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />And I'm Mary. One last thing… could I borrow a pen please?</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Well done Mary. You're making progress. You can usually get help by using these useful phrases…</p>
 <p>I'm really sorry but I'm not sure what to write.<br />Could you explain this form to me please?<br />I know you're busy but I'd be grateful if you could help me.<br />And of course…<br />Could I borrow a pen please?</p>
 <p>Visit bbclearningenglish.com to practise these phrases and learn more about some of the forms you may have to complete when starting university. Now how's Mary getting on?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />….D-O-B…date of birth…. There all done.</p>
 <p><strong>Sharon</strong><br />Ah, hello sweetheart… are those the forms for me? Great. Now all I need now is your passport… to prove who you are.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Yes of course… oh no, my passport! It was in my back pocket…</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel</strong><br />Hello… are you looking for this?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Daniel… my passport! Oh thank you.</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel</strong><br />You look prettier in real life than you do in your passport photo.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Thanks!</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br /> Hello and welcome back to English at University - the series that teaches some English phrases to help you through your first year of study abroad.

 <p>So Mary, are you ready for Freshers' Week?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>…what's Freshers' Week?</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>It's where there are lots of events that'll help you get to know other students or '<strong>freshers</strong>'. You can make friends, and find your way around the campus, and hopefully help you start getting used to living in the UK. It's fun… and it starts right now!</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Right I'd better go….</p>
 <p><strong>Abi<br /></strong>Hey Mary - over here! I run the Get Fit Society – we go running, go to the gym – check out some of the hunks there – fancy joining? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Well errr….</p>

 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oh…hmmm… well…&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Student 1<br /></strong><strong>New recruits</strong> like you get a discount… just errr… nine pounds.</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Mary Mary stop! We can tell you're <strong>the new kid on the block</strong> – someone who's just started university – you don't need to join everything. You need to use some polite ways to say you're not interested – say you're busy, or you haven't got time, or you'll think about it...</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Well I'll try but it's not easy saying 'no'.</p>
 <p><strong>Student 2<br /></strong>Come and have a stab at Fencing Club…</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Fencing? Like sword fighting? Oh interesting… but I'll have a think about it.</p>
 <p><strong>Student 3<br /></strong>Would you like to join the Debating Society?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oh sorry… I don't think I've got the time. Oh, Daniel – it's nice to see a familiar face.</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>Yeah, it is, hi. It's all a bit mad isn't it?&nbsp; I've already signed up for Get Fit Soc…</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Soc?</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>Society. And I've joined the Beer Appreciation Soc… Society. &nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Well that's not really my cup of tea.</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>Oh right. You're thinking of joining Book Club aren't you? Boring - who wants to read more books eh?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Excuse me Daniel. &nbsp;Hello again… I love reading so I think Book Club sounds great – sign me up please!</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>Err yeah… sign me up too mate.</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Poor Mary, she just can't shake off that idiot Daniel – but she has managed to politely say 'no' to some of the people who wanted her to join their clubs and societies by using these phrases…</p>
 <p><strong>I'll have a think about it.<br /></strong><strong>Sorry, I don't think I've got the time.<br /></strong><strong>It's not my cup of tea.</strong></p>

"<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Welcome back to English at University - the series that teaches some English phrases to help you through your first year of study abroad. Mary's finally found her way to the university no thanks to new student, Daniel. She's managed to find her way to the accommodation block and is looking for her new room. It's exciting isn't it Mary?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Well I'm at my room – room 101 – but the door's already open.</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Well you'd better go in. Good luck!</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Oh hello, sorry, I thought this was my room? Room 101?</p>
 <p><strong>Abi</strong><br />Yeah it's room 101 and you must be my new roommate. We share rooms here. I'm Abi, pleased to meet you.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Nice to meet you too – but I didn't realise I was sharing a room.</p>
 <p><strong>Abi</strong><br />Oh don't worry, I won't bite. We'll have a blast.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />A blast?</p>
 <p><strong>Abi</strong><br />A laugh… a party… an amazing time. I've been here three years – it's great, loads of fit guys, parties…</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />And studying?</p>
 <p><strong>Abi</strong><br />What's that! Listen, don't mind my mess. I tend to dry my washing on the window sill, that's when I actually wash it – sorry about the clothes on the floor – and all that stuff on the desk is mine. I'm sure you won't be needing the desk anyway…</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Well errr….</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Mary, this place is a tip. That means it's really messy. It's time to put your foot down. It's your room too so she will have to compromise – you'll have to ask her to tidy up – and set some ground rules – you know, the basic rules of how something should be done.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Oh OK. Abi… it's great that we're going to be roommates but could we set some ground rules please? Would you mind keeping the room a bit more tidy? It would be a great help if I could have some space on the desk to put my things. And err… maybe you could keep your things on your side of the room and I'll look after this side? Would that be a reasonable compromise?</p>
 <p><strong>Abi</strong><br />Oh, well, I suppose so.</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br />Well done Mary! This place looks like a bomb's gone off – it's really untidy! And if you don't say what you want then you won't get it. Even though you're the new girl, Abi will hopefully see that you're not to be messed with. Here are those phrases again…</p>
 <p><strong>Could we set some ground rules please?</strong><br /><strong>Would you mind… keeping the room a bit more tidy?</strong><br /><strong>It would be great if I could have some space on the desk to put my things.</strong><br /><strong>Would that be a reasonable compromise?</strong></p>

 <p><strong>Daniel</strong><br />Anyone at home?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br />Oh no not him!</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel</strong><br />Hi Mary, I found out that this was your room…</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br /> Hello and welcome to English at University - the series that teaches some English phrases to help you through your first year at university. Mary's just landed in London and is heading off for the University of Studies – but there's a problem – she's already lost. Mary, what's happened?&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>I think I got off at the wrong station and now I don't know which way to go.</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>It's time to ask for help. Don't be scared. You'll find Londoners helpful and friendly people. Just be polite and ask them the way and see what they say.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>OK. Here goes. Err, help me will you. I don't know where to go.</p>
 <p><strong>Passer-by<br /></strong>What? Sorry, I'm in a rush.</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>You need to be polite, smile and start with 'excuse me'…</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>OK then. <strong>Excuse me… could you tell me the way to</strong> the University of Studies… please?</p>
 <p><strong>Passer-by<br /></strong>No. Never heard of it.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oh dear. How am I going to find my way there? Oh, I'll ask him… <strong>I wonder if you could help me… please?</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>Are you lost?!</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Yes, I am. <strong>Please could you give me directions to</strong> the University of Studies?</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>Yeah. Of course. I'm going there myself. It's my first day…</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Me too! <strong>I don't suppose you could show me the way, could you?</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>… I don't know why I'm studying there though. I should have gone to Oxford or Cambridge… I did so well in my A levels… but I suppose I can share my 'wisdom' with the other undergraduates… anyway…</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Ermm, there's a sign…</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>…my name's Daniel by the way. Are you just visiting?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>No. I said I'm studying here too. My names Mary and look… there's a sign for the university.</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>Nice to meet you Mabel. I think it's a left turn here then straight on.</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Oh dear Mary. Let's hope he's not doing the same course as you. He sounds like a complete <strong>loser</strong> – an idiot. Anyway, while Daniel's showing her where to go, let's look at the phrases she used to ask for directions…</p>
 <p><strong>Excuse me, could you tell me the way to…<br /></strong><strong>I wonder if you could help me please?<br /></strong><strong>Please could you give me directions to…<br /></strong><strong>I don't suppose you could show me the way, could you?</strong></p>
 <p>You can practise these phrases, pick up a few more plus learn some top tips for travelling in the UK on our website at BBC Learning English dot com. Now, back to Mary… I've got a feeling she's has asked the wrong person for directions. This Daniel seems like <strong>a bit of a numpty </strong>– an idiot.</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>Strange… I thought it was down here. Maybe it was right at the junction?</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>Yep, he's <strong>a</strong> <strong>muppet</strong>. A total idiot.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Oh dear. Maybe we should ask that policeman over there?</p>
 <p><strong>Daniel<br /></strong>No, no, we'll be fine. Err… taxi! Taxi!</p>

"<p><strong>Narrator</strong><br /> Hello and welcome to English at University - the series that brings you the English words and phrases you need to help you through your first year at university. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>We're going to follow new student Mary, who's about to begin <em>her</em> first year of study abroad - &nbsp;at The University of Studies – that's the UK's thirty-second best university. She's been offered a place to study for a degree in Business. It's a great opportunity for her but her mum and dad are sad to see her go…</p>
 <p><strong>Mum </strong><br /> … and she's flying to London today… London in the UK… yes, she's done very well. <strong>I'm so proud of her</strong> but… but I'm worried she's not going to eat properly and she might get in with the wrong crowd and…</p>
 <p><strong>Dad<br /></strong>Your mother is so emotional. It's <strong>the opportunity of a lifetime</strong> for you Mary. <strong>Make the most of it</strong> – forget about us, we'll be fine.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Forget about who?!</p>
 <p><strong>Dad</strong><br /> Ha ha. Now have you packed everything? Clothes, books, toothbrush...&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Mum </strong><br /> Sorry about that. That was your Grandma on the phone – she says good luck and send her a postcard from Paris. I think she meant London. She also said <strong>'Don't do anything I wouldn't do!'</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>What?&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Mum<br /></strong>It's a joke. She learnt it from her English friends. It means <strong>'Have a good time and don't get into trouble'</strong>. Now have you packed everything? Passport, student visa, your acceptance letter from the university and your new laptop – you can use that to video-time us.</p>
 <p><strong>Dad<br /></strong>Good idea – very sensible. Have you got your credit card and cash?</p>
 <p><strong>Mary &nbsp;<br /></strong>Yes Dad!</p>
 <p><strong>Mum<br /></strong>Ah, that sounds like your taxi. Well… bye bye darling<strong>. Safe journey</strong>! <strong>Have a good trip</strong> and <strong>keep in touch</strong>.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary</strong><br /> I'll call as soon as I land in Paris… I mean London!</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator<br /></strong>It can be scary leaving home for the first time, but Mary seems quite cool and calm about it, even though her mum's getting a bit <strong>mushy</strong> – she's getting quite sad and emotional. While Mary says her final goodbyes, let's go over the words of encouragement you can give to someone who's leaving home for the first time…</p>
 <p><strong>I'm proud of you.<br /></strong><strong>It's the opportunity of a lifetime.<br /></strong><strong>Don't do anything I wouldn't do!<br /></strong><strong>Make the most of it.<br /></strong><strong>Safe journey!<br /></strong><strong>Keep in touch!</strong></p>
 <p>To practise these phrases – and to learn some more like this, visit us at BBC Learning English dot com. Now, back to Mary, and her dad's looking a bit tearful… He's <strong>a</strong> <strong>big softy</strong> really – that means he gets emotional very easily.</p>
 <p><strong>Mary<br /></strong>Err Dad, are you ok?</p>
 <p><strong>Dad<br /></strong>Bye Mary… I love you!</p>
 <p><strong>Mum<br /></strong>Bye Mary.&nbsp;Bye. Oh no, look, she's left her 'good luck' teddy bear behind.</p>
 <p><strong>Narrator</strong><br /> Come on Dad, you'll be fine!&nbsp; So Mary is off to the UK to study. In the coming weeks you can hear how she gets on dealing with university life, studying and eventually taking her exams. And I'll be here with some English words and phrases to help her on her way. So join me again soon for English at University. Bye!</p>
