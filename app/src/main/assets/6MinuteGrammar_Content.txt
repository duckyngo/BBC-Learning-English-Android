<p><strong>Catherine</strong><strong>&nbsp; </strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Catherine.</p>
<p><strong>Finn&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>And me, Finn. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />In this programme we're talking about adjectives and adverbs.</p>
<p><strong>Finn&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>We'll tell you what they are and how they&rsquo;re used.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>We'll give you some tips to help you understand the difference between them.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>And we'll also have a quiz to test your understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Right. Let's get started. Finn, can you tell us about adjectives first.</p>
<p><strong>Finn&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>OK. Certainly, let's start with a simple example. What am I holding up?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />You've got two biscuits, Finn . One is <strong>plain </strong>and one is <strong>chocolate</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Yes. Do you like both?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>I do.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Me too. In that sentence there were two adjectives, <strong>plain </strong>and <strong>chocolate</strong>. What do those words do?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Well, Finn. Those words describe the biscuits.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /> </strong>That's right. Adjectives are describing words: they tell us about nouns. In this case they tell us about the biscuits. A <strong>plain </strong>biscuit. A <strong>chocolate </strong>biscuit.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Fantastic. What else do adjectives describe?</p>
<p><strong>Finn&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Lots of things. They can also describe pronouns. Listen out for the adjective <strong>happy</strong> in this example. Here's Neil</p>
<p><strong>Neil&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Peter played well. After the game he was happy.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />The adjective <strong>happy</strong> - what did that refer to?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>It referred to the pronoun <strong>he</strong>, which in this example was Peter.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Yes, Peter was <strong>happy</strong>. He was <strong>happy</strong>. He was a <strong>happy</strong> Peter.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>So adjectives are words that give us information or additional information about nouns. When it comes to adverbs there is a bit of a clue in the name, isn't there, Finn?Ad &ndash; verb, add information about a verb.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>That is one thing that adverbs do. They give us information about verbs. They can tell us how someone does something or how something happens. Now, let's listen again to the example. As well as the adjective <strong>happy </strong>there's also an adverb in the sentence. What is it?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Peter played <strong>well</strong>. After the game he was <strong>happy</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>The adverb there was <strong>well</strong>. Peter played <strong>well</strong>. The word <strong>well</strong> isn't describing Peter himself: it's describing how he did what he did.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /> </strong>And we're talking about adjectives and adverbs.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>We've seen that adjectives describe nouns and adverbs talk about verbs.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>You mentioned that referring to verbs was only one thing that adverbs do. So, where else can we use them?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Adverbs can also describe adjectives, and even other adverbs. Remember the biscuits?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I'm looking at them right now, Finn.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Look good, don&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>They do!</p>
<p><strong>Finn&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>What do you feel when you see the biscuits?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>I feel hungry!</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Is hungry an adjective or adverb?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /> </strong>It is an adjective because it's describing me, my feeling &ndash; and I'm a noun!</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>You are a noun! And now if I ask you how hungry you are, what would you say?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>Well the chocolate biscuit in particular is making me feel <strong>very</strong> hungry.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /> Very</strong> hungry. <strong>Very</strong>. Hungry. What is the word <strong>very </strong>referring to? Is it you, the noun?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /> </strong>No, it's the adjective <strong>hungry</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /> </strong>Exactly.<strong> Very </strong>is an adverb. So as well as adding information about verbs, adverbs can also tell us about adjectives. And they can even tell us about other adverbs. Let's hear our earlier example again please, Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Peter played well. After the game he was happy.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Remember that the word <strong>well</strong> is an adverb. But how <strong>well</strong> did Peter play?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Peter played <strong>really</strong> <strong>well</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>That's right. So here the word <strong>really </strong>is telling us about the adverb <strong>well</strong>. How <strong>well</strong>? <strong>Really</strong> <strong>well</strong>. <strong>Really </strong>is also an adverb.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>So adverbs can tell us about verbs, adjectives and other adverbs.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /> </strong>And adjectives describe nouns and pronouns. And now, it's quiz time.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>We are going to give you a word, and read a sentence which contains the word. You need to decide if the word we give you is an adjective or an adverb.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>OK. So, here's the first one. The word is <strong>blue</strong> and here's the sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>The sky is dark <strong>blue</strong>. The sky is dark <strong>blue</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>So, is <strong>blue</strong> an adjective or adverb?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /> </strong>It&rsquo;s an adjective. <strong>Blue</strong> is describing the noun sky. Now number two: it's actually the same sentence but this time, think about the word <strong>dark</strong>. Is <strong>dark</strong> an adjective or an adverb?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>The sky is <strong>dark</strong> blue.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>Right. So, is <strong>dark</strong> an adjective or adverb?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong><strong>Dark</strong> here is an adverb. Now number three. This time there are three words to listen out for: <strong>delicious</strong>, <strong>very</strong> and <strong>slowly</strong> &ndash; are they adjectives or adverbs?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>Catherine ate the <strong>delicious</strong> biscuit <strong>very</strong> <strong>slowly</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>No, she didn't. She ate it very fast. But, did you get them? <strong>Delicious</strong> is an adjective. It describes the noun biscuit.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong><strong>Slowly </strong>is an adverb.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>And finally, <strong>very</strong> is also an adverb.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>So that's our introduction to adjectives and adverbs</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />There's more about this on our website at bbclearningenglish.com. Join us again for &nbsp;soon more 6 Minute Grammar.</p>
<p><strong>Both</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Bye.</p>

"<div class=""text""dir=""ltr"">
<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></strong></span><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Catherine.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span></strong><span>And me, Finn. And in today's programme we're talking about&hellip; Oww! You hit me! Catherine! That hurt! </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></strong></span><span>Yes, Finn, I hit you.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span></strong><span>I hope there's a grammatical reason for that!</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span><span>Always, Finn. I wouldn't hit you without a good reason. And the reason is, we're talking about active and passive voice today. And in the active voice we say <strong>Catherine hit Finn</strong>: subject - verb - object. Like this:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span></strong><span>Oww! You hit me again!!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>All in the name of grammar.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br /></span></strong><span>OK. <strong>You hit me</strong>. Subject - verb &ndash; object. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span></strong><span>That's right. So, speaking grammatically, the subject &ndash; that's me &ndash; performs or does the action&hellip; </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span></strong><span>And the object of the verb &ndash; that&rsquo;s me - receives or gets the action. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br /><span>Another one?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br /></span></strong><span>No. Catherine hit Finn. But of course I'm more important than you Catherine, so I want to be at the beginning of the sentence. Let's say it this way: Finn was hit by Catherine. Don't do it again.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span><span>Ok - Finn was hit by Catherine. We put the receiver of the verb at the beginning of the </span><span>sentence, plus the verb <strong>to be</strong> and the past participle, to make a passive sentence: Finn was </span><span>hit by Catherine. So here's Rob with some examples of active and passive sentences. </span><span>First an active sentence:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span></strong><span>Millions of people use the internet.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span></strong><span>And with the receiver of the verb at the beginning of the sentence &ndash; in the passive voice.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob <br /></strong></span><span>The internet is used by millions of people.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span><span>Active:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br /></span></strong><span>A thief stole my car.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span><span>Passive:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob <br /></span></strong><span>My car was stolen by a thief.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span><span>Active:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br /></span></strong><span>Somebody rescued the child.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span><span>Passive:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br /></span></strong><span>The child was rescued by somebody.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span><span>Thanks Rob. And now that Catherine has stopped hitting me, we can look at that last pair of sentences more closely. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span><span>OK.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span></strong><span>Thank you. Right, in many situations, the passive sentence <strong>the child was rescued</strong> would sound more natural than <strong>somebody rescued the child</strong> - now, that's if we feel the child is more important than the rescuer. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span><span>Yes - and we don't know who rescued the child, so we don't need to say <strong>by somebody</strong>. It's just: <strong>The child was rescued</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br /></strong></span><span>That's right - if you don't know who or what is doing the verb, or if it's not important, or if </span><span>it's obvious, you can leave it out completely, like this:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span><span>My car was stolen.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span></strong><span>Let's have another sentence in active voice:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span></strong><strong><span>The storm destroyed the bridge</span></strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span></strong><span>And here it is in passive voice:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span></strong><strong><span>The bridge was destroyed by the storm</span></strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span></strong><span>Here, the subject - the storm - is important, so we don't leave it out.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>IDENT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span></strong><span>You're listening to bbclearningenglish.com.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span><span>And we're talking about active and passive voice.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span></strong><span>That's right. When the thing receiving the action of the verb is important, you can show this </span><span>importance, by putting it at the start of the sentence, and using the verb <strong>to be</strong> plus the past </span><span>participle of the verb to make a passive form.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span></strong><span>And if the person or thing doing the verb is obvious, unimportant or unknown, you can </span><span>leave it out.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span></strong><span>Now for our quiz. Which of these news headlines sounds better: is it a):</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br /></span></strong><span>85-year-old Mary Hiker has climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></span></strong><span>Or b):</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br /></span></strong><span>Mount Kilimanjaro has been climbed by an 85-year-old, Mary Hiker.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span><span>Well, they are grammatically correct, but the active sentence a) is the best - if you agree that the name and age of the climber is more important than the name of the mountain she climbed! </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br /></strong></span><span>85-year-old Mary Hiker has climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span></strong><span>Next up - option a):</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob <br /></span></strong><span>The police arrested the burglars and took them to the police station.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span></strong><span>And option b):</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br /></span></strong><span>The burglars were arrested and taken to the police station. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span></strong><span>And the passive in option b) is best - we can guess that the police arrested the burglars, so we don't need to mention them.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob <br /></strong></span><span>The burglars were arrested and taken to the police station. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span><span>And the last one - option a):</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br /></span></strong><span>William posted a photo of his birthday party on his webpage. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span></strong><span>And option b):</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br /></span></strong><span>A photo of William's birthday party was posted by him on his webpage.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span></strong><span>And option a) sounds much better - because William is most definitely the subject of this sentence!</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br /></strong></span><span>William posted a photo of his birthday party on his webpage.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span><span>Now, here's a tip for using the passive voice in spoken English. You may hear people use the verb <strong>get</strong> instead of the verb <strong>be</strong>, like this:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br /></strong></span><span>Your bike will <strong>get stolen</strong> if you don't lock it!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span></strong><span>Right. And if you hit your colleagues, Catherine?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>If you hit your colleagues for a non-grammatical reason, Finn, you will get into trouble.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span></strong><span>OK, thank you very much, and there we are: the passive voice is made with an object, plus the verb to be, plus the past participle.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span><span>And we use it when we're more interested in the object of a verb, or if the subject is </span><span>unknown or obvious.</span></p>

<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello! Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>And me, Catherine. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>In this show we're talking about linking devices.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>Yes, linking devices.&nbsp;There are lots of different kinds, but today we're interested in words and phrases that link a <strong>cause</strong> &ndash; that's something that happens - with its <strong>effect</strong> <strong>or result.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />So words and phrases like <strong>therefore, for that reason</strong> and <strong>because of. </strong>We'll tell you how they work&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>&hellip;We'll give you lots of examples&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>&hellip;And we'll finish off with a quiz to check what you've learnt.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>So here we go. Let's start with an example. So Neil, do you prefer e-books or paper books?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well, I have to say, I'm a bit old fashioned: I like a good paper book.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br />Why's that then?</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br />It just&nbsp;feels&nbsp;more authentic.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>OK, well, we're going to talk today, actually, about e-books, so can you give&nbsp;us an example sentence about e-books. Come on then Neil...</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>E-books are increasingly popular. There has been a fall in sales of paper books<em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>Except to you&nbsp;Neil. Now those two sentences are OK. But we could make them a lot clearer and more interesting by linking the ideas in them together with a word like <strong>consequently</strong>, like this.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>E-books are increasingly popular. <strong>Consequently,</strong> there has been a fall in sales of paper books.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong><strong>Consequently</strong> is a very useful linking word. It shows that the event before the word <strong>consequently</strong> is the cause of the event after it. We could also use the words <strong>therefore, as a result, for that reason, thus</strong> or <strong>that's why.</strong> They all mean the same as <strong>consequently</strong>. And they are all used to join the ideas in two sentences or main clauses together.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Although remember that some are more formal than others. We use <strong>that's why</strong> a lot in informal everyday English.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>I missed the bus <strong>and that's why</strong> I'm late.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Good example Catherine: it would sound wrong to say <strong>I missed the bus</strong> <strong>and therefore I'm late</strong>. Now can you give us an example of a more formal use of linking devices?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>OK, try this one: There was a lot of opposition to the proposal; <strong>therefore,</strong> it was dropped.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Nice one. You can use <strong>consequently</strong> and <strong>thus</strong> instead of <strong>therefore</strong> in this type of sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>That's right. Now let's look at a group of words and phrases that we use to link cause and effect in a slightly different way.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Some examples are: <strong>because of, as a result of, due to</strong> and <strong>owing to</strong>. Listen.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong><strong>Due to</strong> the increasing popularity of e-books, there has been a fall in sales of paper books.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>So how is that different? Well, <strong>due to</strong> is followed by a noun phrase &ndash; <strong>the increasing&nbsp;</strong><strong>popularity of e-books</strong> &ndash; not a complete sentence or main clause. We could also say <strong>due&nbsp;</strong><strong>to e-books increasing in popularity. </strong>That's a participle clause.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>So <strong>due to</strong> joins a noun phrase or a participle clause to the main clause in the sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Exactly. And <strong>as a result of, owing to</strong> or <strong>because of </strong>do too. We could use any of these in that example because they mean the same as <strong>due to</strong>. But <strong>because of</strong> is less formal than the others.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>That's right, and we could also put the sentence the other way round, like this&nbsp;Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>There has been a fall in sales of paper books <strong>due to</strong> the increasing popularity of e-books.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes, it just depends which part of the sentence you want to emphasize by putting first.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT<br /></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>And we're looking at linking devices of cause and effect.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Now for a couple of tips. When you start a sentence, in writing, with a noun phrase, be sure to use a comma after it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>So <strong>As a result of</strong> <strong>the fall in paper book sales,</strong> (comma) some bookshops are struggling to stay open.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>That's right. But don't use a comma if the noun phrase comes at the end.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>And if we're using a verb phrase, we can introduce it with the phrase <strong>the fact that.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes. You could say <strong>As a result of</strong> <strong>the fact that book sales have fallen,</strong> some bookshops are struggling to stay open.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>That's right.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>And now it's quiz time! Complete these sentences. Number 1. Our climate is changing a) due to the Arctic ice is melting. b) therefore the Arctic ice is melting.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>The answer's b) therefore the Arctic ice is melting.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well done! Number 2. Lewis was promoted a) for that reason his hard work. b) as a result of his hard work.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>It's b) as a result of his hard work.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Very good! Number 3. The accident happened a) owing to the fog on the motorway. b) owing to the fog was on the motorway.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>This time it's a) owing to the fog on the motorway.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Well done indeed! I hope wherever you are, you listened carefully to the show and <strong>as a result</strong> you got all the answers right.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>That's good and there's more about this on our website at <a href=""http://www.bbclearningenglish.com"">bbclearningenglish.com</a>. Join us again for more 6 Minute Grammar.</p>
<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye.</p>

"<div class=""text""dir=""ltr"">
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><strong>&nbsp; </strong><strong>&nbsp;<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Catherine.</p>
<p><strong>Finn &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>And me, Finn. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />In this programme we're talking about present tenses.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Finn &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Now let's get started. The first thing we need to know is that the present simple tense is mainly for facts, habits and truths. Now, Catherine, give me a true fact about you.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>A true fact about me is that I like gardening.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Oh, wow, great.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>Love it.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Thanks Catherine. And can you tell me one of your habits?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>I drink a cup of coffee every morning. I drink one at home and I drink another one when I get to work.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>So far so good. We make the present simple with a subject and base verb, and we add <strong>-s</strong> to the verb for <strong>he</strong>, <strong>she</strong> and <strong>it</strong>. So: I work, you work, he works, she works, and so on. We make questions and negatives with <strong>do</strong> or <strong>does</strong>. So Catherine, do you take milk in your coffee?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>I do take milk in my coffee, Finn. Do you take milk in your coffee?</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />I don't. I like it black.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>And what about Mrs Finn, does she take milk in her coffee?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>She doesn't drink coffee.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>Oh, what does she drink?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Tea. All the time.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>Very British.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Good. So that's present simple for facts and habits. Now when we're talking about activities, temporary situations, and things that are happening now &ndash; or around now &ndash; we use <strong>am</strong>, <strong>is</strong> or <strong>are </strong>plus an <strong>i-n-g verb</strong> to make the present continuous. So Finn, what are you doing now?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Now, right now, right at this minute, I'm sitting in the studio, on a chair, talking to you, but off and on, I'm also reading a novel called The Unconsoled by Kazuo Ishiguro. It's great.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>Well pronounced.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Thank you. And are you reading anything right now Catherine?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>Yes I am. I'm reading a novel also. It's a comedy about Adrian Mole and it's really good, I'm enjoying it a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Sounds great. I'd like to borrow it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>You can. We can also use the present continuous for future arrangements. So Finn, what are you doing tonight?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Tonight I'm taking my wife to dinner. Don't tell her.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>Lucky wife.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>That's right. So, present simple for facts and habits; present continuous for activities and future arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />And now for the present perfect. We make it with <strong>have</strong> or <strong>has</strong> plus the past participle, it connects the past to the present, and it's useful for asking about life experiences. So, life experience question coming, Finn. Have you ever eaten insects?</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />I have, yes. I've eaten ants and beetles in Cambodia. So in the question, the word <strong>ever</strong> means 'at any time in your life'. <strong>Never</strong> means at no time in your life. So Catherine, tell us about an experience that you have <strong>never</strong> had.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>Well, I've never eaten insects Finn. And I've never been on safari. But I'm sure that our colleague Rob has been on safari.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>He's been to many places.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>He has. Other words we use with present perfect are <strong>just</strong>, <strong>already</strong> and <strong>yet</strong>. We use <strong>just</strong>, <strong>already</strong> and <strong>yet</strong> a lot when we're using the present perfect tense to talk about the present effect of a past event. <strong>Already</strong> means something has happened, perhaps earlier than expected. So Finn, give us an example of <strong>already</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Right. I've <strong>already</strong> had breakfast today.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>And coffee? Have you had coffee?</p>
<p><strong>Finn &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>I've <strong>just</strong> had a cup of coffee. <strong>Just</strong> means recently. I haven't had lunch <strong>yet</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>I should think not, it's only half ten.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>It's a bit early for lunch, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />And <strong>yet</strong> means something like 'not until now'.</p>
<p><strong>Finn &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>Good. And if a past situation has continued until now, use <strong>for</strong> or <strong>since</strong> to say how long it has continued, like this:</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />I've lived in London <strong>for</strong> five years. I've been married <strong>since</strong> 2003.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>We also use the present perfect is to give news. Things that happened a short time ago, and are important now. So, have you got any news for us, Catherine?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Yes I have, actually.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>OK?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>I've won the lottery!</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>I don't believe you.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>That's because I'm not telling the truth, it's just an example!</p>
<p><strong>IDENT &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>You're listening to bbclearningenglish.com.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />And we're talking about present tenses. And it's quiz time! Question one. Which of these sentences best describes a habit? a) I have smoked 20 cigarettes a day, b) I smoke 20 cigarettes a day.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /> </strong>And the answer's b) I smoke 20 cigarettes a day. Question two. Is this sentence grammatically correct, or wrong? Humans have not visited the planet Mars yet, but they have already been to the moon.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /> </strong>It's correct.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>It is. Now, last one: Which sentence is correct? a) Catherine has never eaten insects, b) Catherine never eats insects, or c) Catherine is never eating insects.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>And the answer is that both a) and b) are correct. As a life experience it's true to say that I have never eaten insects; and as a fact I can say: I never eat insects. So that brings us to the end of the quiz, and well done to you if you got them all right.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />A free insect for everyone who got all of those right! Now, there's more about this on our website at bbclearningenglish.com. Join us again for more 6 Minute Grammar.&nbsp;</p>

"<div class=""text""dir=""ltr"">
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br /></strong></span><span>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Catherine. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br /></span></strong><span>And me, Neil.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br /></strong></span><span>Neil, have a sandwich. It's from Finn. He said you were hungry.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>Really?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br /></strong></span><span>Yes! He said... In fact, Finn said: ""He's hungry. Give him a sandwich."" </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br /></span></strong><span>Wow! That's very kind of Finn. It's delicious.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>And in today's programme we're talking about reported speech. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br /></span></strong><span>We'll be discussing why and when we use it. And we'll see how to form it...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>We use reported speech when we want to report something that another person said. In o</span><span>ur example, Finn originally said:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br /></strong></span><span><strong>He's hungry.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br /></span></strong><span>That's direct speech. Catherine reported the direct speech, like this:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>Finn said you were hungry.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br /></span></strong><span>Let's look at that more closely. We need to make some grammatical changes when we report what someone else says. First, when the speaker or listener changes, we need to change the pronouns.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>That's right. Finn used <strong>he</strong> in direct speech to talk about Neil:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br /><span><strong>He</strong> is hungry. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br /></span></strong><span>Then Catherine told me what Finn said.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br /></strong></span><span>Finn said <strong>you</strong> were hungry.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br /></span></strong><span>Second change: In reported speech we often move the tense back one step into the past. So <strong>is hungry</strong> becomes <strong>were hungry</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br /></strong></span><span>But we don't have to change the verb tense in reported speech if the situation is generally true. Here's an example. Finn, give us a sentence please:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br /></span></strong><span>OK. I <strong>love</strong> cheese sandwiches. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br /></strong></span><span>Thank you, Finn. And Neil, can you report what Finn said, please?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>Yes. Finn said he <strong>loves</strong> cheese sandwiches. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>OK. So there we don't change <strong>loves</strong> to <strong>loved</strong>, because Finn loves cheese sandwiches and that's a general truth. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br /></span></strong><span>Now the third thing we need with reported speech is a reporting verb. <strong>Say</strong> and <strong>tell</strong> are the most common ones. And we usually put them in the past tense. For example: Finn <strong>said</strong> Neil was hungry.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br /></strong></span><span>Now let's look at how to report questions with question words like <strong>What</strong> and <strong>Who</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br /></span></strong><span>We'll hear the direct speech first from Finn, then Catherine will give us the reported speech. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br /></strong></span><span>What's the time?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>Finn asked what the time was.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br /></span></strong><span>The reporting verb comes first, then the question word, and then the reported sentence with the tense moved back. And don't forget to change the word order from question word order to statement word order. Another one please Finn and Catherine?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br /></span></strong><span>Who ate the cake?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>He asked who'd eaten the cake.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>OK, now it's time to look at pronunciation. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>Yes, pronuciation. Some past tense forms in reported speech can be difficult to hear. In the last example, the two words <strong>who</strong> and <strong>had</strong> become who'd. He asked who'd eaten the cake.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>So <strong>had</strong> is shortened to just a <strong>/d/</strong> sound. Listen out for the short <strong>/d/</strong> sound in this next example:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br /></span></strong><span>She asked where I'd gone.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br /></span></strong><span>So, the phrase <strong>I had</strong> becomes <strong>I'd</strong>. One more time please Finn:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br /></span></strong><span>She asked where I'd gone.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br /></strong></span><span>Thank you, Finn. So watch out for contractions in reported speech.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br /></span></strong><span>And now are you ready?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>For a quiz?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br /></span></strong><span>It's quiz time! Finn is going to say some sentences in direct speech. As you listen, decide what the correct reported speech is. Here's the first one.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br /></strong></span><span>I've eaten my lunch.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>Is the reported speech a) He said he's eating his lunch or b) He said he'd eaten his lunch?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br /></strong></span><span>And the answer is b) He said he'd eaten his lunch. The present perfect changes to the past perfect. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>OK. Next one please Finn:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br /></strong></span><span>I go to work by bus.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>Is the reported speech a) Finn said he goes to work by bus or b) Finn said he's going to work by bus?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br /></strong></span><span>And it's a) Finn said he goes to work by bus. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>OK. And here's the last one: </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br /></strong></span><span>Where are my glasses?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>Is it a) He asked where were his glasses or b) He asked where his glasses were?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br /></strong></span><span>And the right answer is b) He asked where his glasses were. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>Now, before we go, there&rsquo;s just enough time for a top tip. With the reporting verb <strong>tell</strong> we say who the person is talking to, for example, Finn <strong>told me</strong> he's going to pay for lunch today.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br /></strong></span><span>Wow! And when we use the reporting verb <strong>say</strong> we don't say who the person is talking to. So this next sentence is wrong:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>Finn <strong>said me</strong> he was going to pay for lunch today.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>Yes, that's wrong but this one is correct:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>Finn <strong>said </strong>he was going to pay for lunch today.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br /></strong></span><span>So that's reported speech.</span></p>

"<div class=""text""dir=""ltr"">
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Neil&hellip;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>And me, Catherine. Hello.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>And today, we&rsquo;re talking about the third conditional. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>Yes - we&rsquo;ll be looking at why and when we use it.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br /></span></strong><span>And we&rsquo;ll see how to form it&hellip;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>There&rsquo;ll be at a very helpful pronunciation tip&hellip;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>And there&rsquo;ll also be a third conditional quiz at the end of the show!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>Now, the main use of the third conditional is to talk about imaginary situations in the past. And here&rsquo;s Mike with our first example:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Mike<br /></span></strong><span>I was really late for work today. When I got to the station, it turned out the trains were cancelled. <strong>If I had known the trains were cancelled, I would have taken a bus.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>And Mike&rsquo;s last sentence is describing an imaginary situation. In reality, Mike was late for work because he didn&rsquo;t know the trains were cancelled, and he didn&rsquo;t take a bus. He uses the third conditional to imagine a different past situation when he says: <strong>If I had known the trains were cancelled, I would have taken a bus.</strong> </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look. There are two parts to this sentence. One part is made with <strong>if </strong>plus <strong>past perfect</strong>:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Mike<br /></span></strong><span><strong>If I had known</strong> the trains were cancelled &hellip;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br /></span></strong><span>And the other part is made of <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>would have</strong> plus a <strong>past participle</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Mike<br /></span></strong><span>&hellip; <strong>I</strong> <strong>would have taken</strong> a bus.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br /></strong></span><span>And we put the two parts together to talk about an imaginary situation in the past, and its </span><span>imaginary result. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br /></span></strong><span>You can change the order of the two parts if you like: the meaning stays the same:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Mike<br /></span></strong><span><strong>I would have taken</strong> a bus <strong>if I had known</strong> the trains were cancelled.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br /></span></strong><span>Let&rsquo;s have some more examples. Listen out for <strong>if</strong> plus <strong>past perfect</strong> with <strong>would </strong></span><span><strong>have</strong> plus a <strong>past participle</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Mike<br /></span></strong><span>I got two Ds and an F in my exams. <strong>If I had worked harder, I would have got better </strong></span><strong><span>grades.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Patty was a great singer when she was younger. <strong>She would have won that TV talent show if she had entered it.</strong> </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>And we can use negatives in either or both parts of the sentence. Here are a couple of examples, with the negative forms <strong>hadn&rsquo;t</strong> and <strong>wouldn&rsquo;t</strong>:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Mike<br /></span></strong><span>Abid met his wife at university. They&rsquo;ve been married for 3 years now.<strong> If Abid hadn&rsquo;t gone to university, he wouldn&rsquo;t have met his wife. </strong></span></p>
<p><span>I registered my mobile phone on a tracker website. When I lost it, I logged on to the site and they told me where it was.<strong> If I hadn&rsquo;t registered my phone, it would have been lost for ever.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br /></strong></span><span>So you can see that the third conditional is very useful to talk about things we&rsquo;re pleased we did, as well as things we wish we&rsquo;d done differently. So what about you Neil &ndash; anything you&rsquo;d change &ndash; or not change &ndash; in your past?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>I lived in Canada when I was a child and if I hadn&rsquo;t lived in Canada I wouldn&rsquo;t have got dual citizenship. I&rsquo;m a citizen of the UK and Canada. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>IDENT<br /></span></strong><span>6 Minute Grammar from the BBC.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br /></strong></span><span>And we&rsquo;re talking about third conditionals. And now it&rsquo;s time to talk about pronunciation. We use lots of short forms in third conditionals. And here&rsquo;s Mike again with an example. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Mike<br /></span></strong><span>If <strong>I&rsquo;d</strong> had my camera, <strong>I&rsquo;d</strong> have taken a photo. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br /></strong></span><span>So in the <strong>if</strong> part, <strong>I</strong> and <strong>had</strong> are shortened to <strong>I&rsquo;d.</strong> In the main part, <strong>I </strong>and <strong>would</strong> are </span><span>shortened to <strong>I&rsquo;d</strong>, and we also drop the <strong>h</strong> from have. So <strong>I would have</strong> becomes <strong>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d&rsquo;ve&rsquo;. </strong>Let&rsquo;s hear another example:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Mike<br /></span></strong><strong><span>If I&rsquo;d woken up earlier, I wouldn&rsquo;t have missed my flight.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br /></strong></span><span>So <strong>I had</strong> &nbsp;become <strong>I&rsquo;d</strong> in the if part and <strong>would not have</strong> becomes <strong>&lsquo;wouldn&rsquo;t&rsquo;ve&rsquo;</strong> in the </span><span>main part. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>Now it&rsquo;s time for a quiz! I&rsquo;m going to say two sentences, and you have to use them to make a third conditional sentence. Here&rsquo;s the first one. Mike forgot Jane&rsquo;s birthday. She was upset.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br /></strong></span><span>If Mike hadn&rsquo;t forgotten Jane&rsquo;s birthday, she wouldn&rsquo;t have been upset. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>Good. Another one: I ate too much. I feel sick.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br /></strong></span><span>If I hadn&rsquo;t eaten too much, I wouldn&rsquo;t have felt sick.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>And the last one: I didn&rsquo;t go to the party. I didn&rsquo;t meet Francesca.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>I would&rsquo;ve met Francesca if I&rsquo;d gone to the party.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>Exactly. And that&rsquo;s the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them all right. And we&rsquo;ve just got time for a top tip before we finish. Remember, in standard English, there&rsquo;s only one <strong>would</strong> in a third conditional sentence. We don&rsquo;t use <strong>would</strong> in the <strong>if</strong> part. Here&rsquo;s an example of an incorrect sentence.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Mike<br /></strong></span><span>If Tom would have said sorry, Sonia would have forgiven him.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>Here&rsquo;s the correct version:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Mike<br /></strong></span><strong><span>If Tom had said sorry, Sonia would have forgiven him.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil<br /></strong></span><span>Great. So that&rsquo;s the third conditional. It&rsquo;s made of <strong>if</strong> plus the <strong>past perfect</strong> tense, and <strong>would</strong> <strong>have</strong> plus the past participle. We use it to talk about imaginary situations in the past.</span></p>

"<div class=""text""dir=""ltr"">
<p><span><strong>Neil</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Neil. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span><span>And me, Catherine. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span><span>Today we're talking about the present perfect continuous tense.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>We&rsquo;ll remind you when to use it and how to form it&hellip;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span><span>We&rsquo;ll also look at using it with the words <strong>just </strong>and <strong>already</strong> and other adverbs. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine</strong> <br /></span><span>And we&rsquo;ll finish with a quiz. So let&rsquo;s kick things off with an example of the present perfect continuous, read for us by Finn.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br /></span></strong><span>I&rsquo;ve been reading that book you lent me last weekend&hellip; it&rsquo;s great!</span></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>Thank you Finn. So <strong>I&rsquo;ve been reading&hellip; </strong>is an action that started in the past and is continuing in the present: Finn is still reading that book. Here&rsquo;s another example:</p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Finn<br /></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">It&rsquo;s been raining since 9 o&rsquo;clock this morning.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br /></span></strong><span>It has! It started raining in the morning, continued raining and it&rsquo;s still raining now.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>We can also use the present perfect continuous for actions that have recently finished. An example, please Finn.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br /></span></strong><span>I&rsquo;ve got paint all over my clothes because I&rsquo;ve been decorating the living room.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br /></span></strong><span>Ah, so Finn's got paint all over his clothes, and that's the evidence he was painting but now he's finished. Another example please, Finn:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br /></span></strong><span>Joe! Where have you been? I&rsquo;ve been trying to get hold of you&hellip; I&rsquo;ve got some bad news.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>So, Finn has finally managed to find Joe. The action of looking for Joe has finished but Finn was looking right up until the moment he found him. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br /></span></strong><span>To say how long an action has been happening for, we can add a time expression.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br /></span></strong><span>Jack has got a big concert tomorrow. He&rsquo;s been rehearsing <strong>all day</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>We&rsquo;ve been going to the same hotel<strong> for the last ten years</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br /></span></strong><span>Earlier, Finn said: it has been raining<strong> since 9 o&rsquo;clock this morning</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span><strong>For three hours, for the last ten years </strong>and<strong> since 9 o&rsquo;clock this morning</strong> tell us how long the activity has been happening. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br /></span></strong><span>The present perfect continuous is often used with the words <strong>already</strong> and <strong>just</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>That's right, we can use <strong>already </strong>if an action hasn&rsquo;t finished, and we want to emphasise how long it&rsquo;s been happening. Finn:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br /></span></strong><span>She&rsquo;s <strong>alread</strong>y been sleeping for three hours.</span></p>
<p><span>This chicken has <strong>already</strong> been cooking for two hours.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>We use <strong>just</strong> when the action has already finished - and we want to emphasise how recently it finished.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br /></span></strong><span>There&rsquo;s Yasemin &ndash; I&rsquo;ve <strong>just</strong> been talking to her husband on the phone!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>We can also use <strong>recently </strong>or <strong>lately</strong> to say that a situation or action finished only a short while ago, but they are a little further back in time than <strong>just</strong>. So, Neil, have you been doing anything special recently&hellip;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br /></span></strong><span>Well, I&rsquo;ve been trying to lose a bit of weight recently, so I&rsquo;ve been going to the gym after work. </span></p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br />It's starting to show a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Yes. How about you, Catherine&hellip;?</p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Catherine<br /></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Well, I&rsquo;m afraid I haven't been going to the gym because I&rsquo;ve been feeling rather tired lately and I haven&rsquo;t been sleeping very well.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br /></span></strong><span>You&rsquo;ve been working too hard! Now, we form the present perfect continuous with the <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>have</strong> or <strong>has </strong>and the <strong>present participle</strong> of the main verb. Here are some examples:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br /></span></strong><span>Jack has been working hard.</span></p>
<p><span>It&rsquo;s been raining &hellip;</span></p>
<p><span>I&rsquo;ve been reading that book &hellip;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>And for negatives, it&rsquo;s <strong>subject </strong>plus <strong>haven&rsquo;t</strong> or <strong>hasn&rsquo;t </strong>and the <strong>present participle</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br /></span></strong><span>I haven&rsquo;t been sleeping very well.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>We usually put <strong>just </strong>and <strong>already</strong> between <strong>have</strong> or <strong>has</strong> and the <strong>past participle</strong>. So it&rsquo;s She&rsquo;s <strong>already</strong> been sleeping for three hours.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br /></span></strong><span><strong>&hellip;</strong>and I&rsquo;ve <strong>just</strong> been talking to her husband &hellip;.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>But time expressions usually go after the main verb. So it&rsquo;s Jack&rsquo;s been studying <strong>all day</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br /></span></strong><span>And don&rsquo;t forget to use short forms like <strong>I&rsquo;ve&hellip; It&rsquo;s&hellip; haven&rsquo;t&hellip; hasn&rsquo;t </strong>with the present perfect continuous.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong></p>
<p><span>6 Minute Grammar from the BBC.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine <br /></span></strong><span>And we're talking about the present perfect continuous. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br /></span></strong><span>We use it to talk about an activity that started in the past and is continuing now or has recently finished.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>And we often use it with the adverbs <strong>just </strong>and<strong> already</strong>, and with other time expressions like <strong>recently</strong> and<strong> lately</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br /></span></strong><span>Time for our quiz. Number one. Which is correct? The chicken only needs another fifteen minutes. It's a) &hellip;already been cooking for two hours, or b) It&rsquo;s just been cooking for two hours. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br /><span>And that's a) because the chicken is still cooking.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br /></span></strong><span>That's correct. Number 2. a) Where have you been? I wait for you for half an hour. b) Where have you been? I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you for half an hour. </span></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>It&rsquo;s b) because you use the present perfect continuous to say how long you have been doing an action.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Neil<br /></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Finally, number 3. a) You&rsquo;ve been listening just to 6 minute grammar. b) You&rsquo;ve just been listening to 6 minute grammar.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br /><span>It&rsquo;s b) because <strong>just</strong> goes between the auxiliary <strong>have</strong> and <strong>been</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br /></span></strong><span>Correct and it&rsquo;s the end of the show. There's lots more about this on our website at bbclearningenglish.com. Join us again for more 6 Minute Grammar soon.</span></p>

"<div class=""text""dir=""ltr"">
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Finn.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>And me, Catherine. In this programme we're talking about the words <strong>all, every, each, both, either</strong> and <strong>neither</strong>...</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>...also known as quantifiers. So let's start by listening to Darren. He's been talking about how to choose a tablet.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>While you listen, think about this question: Why do customers have difficulty choosing a tablet?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT <br /></strong><strong>Darren<br /></strong>Should you have <strong>either</strong> this one <strong>or</strong> that one? <strong>All</strong> customers choosing a tablet ask themselves that question because <strong>each</strong> tablet is slightly different. Take the Apik 1 and the Negus 2. <strong>Both</strong> tablets have similar specs. While <strong>neithe</strong>r tablet is heavy, the Negus 2 is lighter. This could make a difference <strong>every </strong>time you go out. <strong>Each of</strong> the tablets has 2 gigabytes of RAM, but the Negus 2 is the faster device. And then there&rsquo;s the cost. While <strong>neither of </strong>them seems much better than the other, the Negus 2 is considerably cheaper.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>That was Darren. So we asked you: Why do buyers have difficulty choosing tablets?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>And the answer is: Because <strong>each</strong> tablet has slightly different features.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Now <strong>each</strong>,<strong> every</strong> and <strong>all</strong> can mean the full amount or total number of something. So we could also say <strong>every tablet </strong>or <strong>all tablets</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong><strong>Each</strong> and <strong>every </strong>are followed by a singular noun and verb. We say <strong>each tablet has </strong>and<strong> every tablet</strong> <strong>has</strong> - but <strong>all</strong> is followed by a plural noun and verb, so it&rsquo;s <strong>all tablets have</strong>. We could also say <strong>all the tablets have</strong>, but we don&rsquo;t use <strong>the</strong> with <strong>each</strong> or <strong>every</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>OK. There&rsquo;s also a slight difference in meaning between <strong>every</strong> and <strong>each</strong>. We often use <strong>each</strong> when we're thinking about the individual members of a group.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>That's right. So to talk about about the features of individual tablets, Darren said <strong>each tablet</strong>. But here's what he said later on.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br />Darren<br /></strong>This could make a difference <strong>every time</strong> you go out.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>There he's thinking about all the times, not individual times.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Right. Listen for more quantifiers in this clip.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br /></strong><strong>Darren&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></strong>Should you have <strong>either</strong> this one <strong>or</strong> that one? <strong>Both</strong> tablets have similar specs. While <strong>neithe</strong>r tablet is heavy, the Negus 2 is lighter.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>There we heard the words <strong>either</strong>,<strong> neither</strong>, or as some people say, <strong>either</strong>, <strong>neither</strong>, and <strong>both.</strong> We use these quantifiers to talk about two people or things. So in the phrase <strong>Both tablets have similar specs, Both tablets</strong> means <strong>this tablet and the other tablet</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong><strong>Neither tablet is heavy</strong>. That means <strong>not this one and not the other one</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>Darren asked: <strong>Should you have either this one or that one?</strong> <strong>Either</strong> is used mainly in questions and negatives, to indicate a choice between two, or sometimes more than two, options. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Right. Let's take a quick look at the verbs we use after <strong>both</strong> and <strong>neither</strong>. Listen. <strong>Both the tablets have </strong>similar specs. <strong>Neither tablet is </strong>heavy.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>So after <strong>both</strong>, the verb is positive and plural &ndash; <strong>have</strong>. But after <strong>either</strong> and <strong>neither</strong>, the verb is positive and singular - <strong>is</strong>. Let's have another clip.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br /></strong><strong>Darren<br /></strong><strong>Each of</strong> the tablets has 2 gigabytes of RAM, but the Negus 2 is the faster device. While <strong>neither of </strong>them seems much better than the other, the Negus 2 is considerably cheaper.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>So we heard<strong> each of the tablets </strong>and<strong> neither of them. </strong>You can use<strong> all</strong>,<strong> each</strong>,<strong> neither</strong>,<strong> either </strong>and<strong> both </strong>with <strong>of</strong> and a plural noun phrase &ndash; like <strong>the tablets</strong> &ndash; or with a pronoun &ndash; like <strong>them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Yes. So you could say <strong>both of the tablets</strong> or <strong>both of them</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>Yes and in this case,<strong> each of the tablets </strong>means the same as<strong> both of the tablets. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Because there are only two.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>But we say <strong>each of the tablets has</strong> - that&rsquo;s a&nbsp;singular verb - but <strong>both of the tablets have </strong>- and that's a plural verb.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />6 Minute Grammar from BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>And it's quiz time!</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>OK.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>Number one: Which is correct: a) Both of us lives in London. Or b) Both of us live in London.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>And the answer is b) Both of us live in London.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br />And let's do number two: Which is correct? a) Neither of us likes the countryside. Or b) Neither of us doesn't like the countryside.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br />This one&hellip; is a) Neither of us likes the countryside.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>Number three: Which is correct? a) Answer each questions. Or b) Answer each of the questions.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>The answer is b). Answer each of the questions.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>Fantastic! And that's the end of the quiz.</p>

<p><strong>Both<br /></strong>Bye!</p>

"<div class=""text""dir=""ltr"">
<p><strong><span>Finn<br /></span></strong><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar. I'm Finn&hellip;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>And I'm Catherine. And today we're talking about phrasal verbs and prepositional verbs.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br /></span></strong><span>Yes, we'll explain what they are and how you use them...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>We'll have lots of examples and of course we'll finish with a quiz.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br /></span></strong><span>But first, let's listen to Mary. She's a lifestyle coach and she has some advice for us about friends and friendship.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>And listen out for the answer to this question: What do psychologists say that it is important to do?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<br /></span></strong><span><strong>Mary<br /></strong>How often do you and your friends <strong>get together</strong>? In our busy lives today, it's easy to <strong>let our </strong>friends <strong>down</strong> by <strong>putting off</strong> social arrangements or even forgetting to <strong>ring</strong> them <strong>up</strong>. Yet our friends are the people who <strong>stand by </strong>us when we need support. So while it's great to <strong>keep up with</strong> people on social media, psychologists <strong>point out</strong> that it's really important to make time to <strong>meet up</strong> together too.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br /></span></strong><span>So that was Mary. And we asked: What do psychologists say that it is important to do?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>And the answer is: They say it's important for us and our friends to <strong>meet up</strong>. And I think they mean face to face. What do you think, Finn?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br /></strong></span><span>They do. Face-to-face meeting up is the best thing, they say. And there's our first phrasal verb - <strong>meet up</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>Yes, meet up. Now, a phrasal verb is a two-word verb made of a verb plus a little word like <strong>in</strong>,<strong> on</strong>,<strong> out</strong>, or<strong> up</strong>. We usually think of<strong> in</strong>,<strong> on</strong>,<strong> out</strong>, and<strong> up</strong> as prepositions, but in phrasal verbs they behave more like adverbs.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br /><span>They do. In the phrasal verb <strong>meet up</strong>, the adverb <strong>up</strong> modifies the meaning of the verb <strong>meet</strong>. <strong>Meet</strong> and <strong>meet up</strong> are very similar in meaning. But the adverb sometimes does more than that. Listen to this clip.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<br /></span></strong><strong><span>Mary<br /></span></strong><span>...psychologists <strong>point out</strong> that it's really important to make time to <strong>meet up</strong> together too.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br /></span></strong><span>Right, we heard the phrasal verb <strong>point out</strong> there, but it doesn't mean the same as the verb <strong>point</strong>. <strong>Point out</strong> means to say something interesting, or unusual or useful. And the adverb changes the meaning significantly. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>It does. Now listen out for more phrasal verbs in this clip.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<br /></span></strong><span><strong>Mary&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></strong>In our busy lives today, it's easy to <strong>let </strong>our friends <strong>down</strong> by <strong>putting off</strong> social arrangements or even forgetting to <strong>ring</strong> them <strong>up</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br /></span></strong><span>Now if we <strong>let</strong> our friends <strong>down</strong>, it means that we don't help or support them. And when we <strong>put off</strong> arrangements, we cancel or delay them. And if we <strong>ring</strong> people <strong>up</strong>, we phone them.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>And those are interesting phrasal verbs because when they have an object, we can put the object either between the verb and the adverb, or we can put it after the adverb.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br /></span></strong><span>Like this: we can <strong>let our friends down</strong> or we can&nbsp;<strong>let down our friends</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>You wouldn't let your friends down.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br /></span></strong><span>I'd never let my friends down, Catherine. Or my colleagues.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>And we can <strong>put off arrangements</strong> or <strong>put arrangements off</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br /></span></strong><span>We can. But be careful. If the object is a pronoun, you have to put it in the middle. For example, you have to say <strong>ring them up</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>Yeah. Don't say <strong>ring up them</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br /></span></strong><span>No, don't say that. Now, one more clip. Can you spot any more phrasal verbs?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<br /></span></strong><span><strong>Mary<br /></strong></span><span>Yet our friends are the people who <strong>stand by us</strong> when we need support.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>Well, we just heard<strong> stand by us.</strong> And you are probably wondering why the pronoun is at the end of the verb because we just said that you can't put pronouns at the end. But <strong>stand by</strong> is a slightly different type of verb, because <strong>by</strong> isn't an adverb. It's a preposition.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br /></span></strong><span>That's right. In some two-word verbs, the second word such as <strong>by</strong>,<strong> with</strong>,<strong> into</strong>, or<strong> on </strong>behaves like a preposition, not an adverb. And in these verbs, the object or object pronoun always comes after the preposition.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>OK. So Mary said that it's great to <strong>keep up with</strong> people on social media. And&nbsp;<strong>keep up with</strong> means <strong>keep in contact with</strong>, and it's a phrasal verb made of three parts: a verb: <strong>keep</strong>, plus an adverb: <strong>up</strong>, plus a preposition: <strong>with</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br /></span></strong><span>That's right. And with phrasal verbs with three parts, the object always comes at the end. We <strong>keep up with people</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />6 Minute Grammar from the BBC.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>And it's time for a quiz! Number one. Is this sentence correct or wrong? She took her coat off, hung it up and sat down. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br /></span></strong><span>That's correct. Number two: correct or wrong? We keep with each other up by phone and email.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>And that one is wrong...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br /></span></strong><span>I know.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>...sounds horrible! The correct sentence is: We keep up with each other by phone and email. So, number three: I turned down the job because it was too far away. Now the question is: can you also say a) I turned down it. Or b) I turned it down?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br /><span>Well, this time you can say b) I turned it down. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br /></span></strong><span>You can. And very good if you got those right at home. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br /></span></strong><span>There's more about this at bbclearningenglish.com. So join us again soon for more 6 Minute Grammar. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Both<br /></span></strong><span>Bye!</span></p>

"<div class=""text""dir=""ltr"">
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>And me, Catherine. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Now, Catherine, would you like to have some of this delicious chocolate I've got here?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Oh Neil, I'd love to but I can't. When I eat chocolate, I get terrible headaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Oh that's bad luck! If I eat a lot of chocolate, I just get fat!&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Do you? You don't look it, you look thin!</p>
<p><strong>Neil &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>It's all the cycling you see. I can eat whatever I want because of all the cycling.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /> </strong>Lucky you.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>Now, in this programme, we're looking at the zero conditional and the first conditional.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>We'll be discussing why and when we use them.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br /></strong>We'll see how to form them...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>We'll help you decide which one to use in which situation...</p>
<p><strong>Neil &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>And we'll bring you a quiz at the end of the show.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>So listen carefully - and take some notes!</p>
<p><strong>Neil &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Let's start by looking at the zero conditional. We use it to talk about things which always happen in particular situations.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>For example,<strong> I always get a headache if I eat chocolate.</strong> We also use the zero conditional to talk about facts and truths. And here's Finn with our first example.</p>
<p><strong>Finn&nbsp;<br /></strong><strong>If you drop an apple, it falls to the ground.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>That's gravity for you! Now, there are two parts to the sentence. The part with <strong>if</strong> plus the <strong>present simple</strong> tells us the situation, and the other part is in the present simple tense, and tells us what happens as a result of the<strong> if</strong> situation. Here's Finn with an example of the <strong>if</strong> situation:</p>
<p><strong>Finn &nbsp;<br /></strong><strong>If you drop an apple</strong>...</p>
<p>And I'll say that again: <strong>If you drop an apple</strong>...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />And the result:</p>
<p><strong>Finn &nbsp;<br /></strong>...<strong>it falls to the ground.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>Once more:</p>
<p><strong>Finn &nbsp;<br /></strong>...<strong>it falls to the ground.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>And this result happens every time the situation happens. Isn't that right, Catherine?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>That's correct Neil. It's a scientific fact - and it was first identified by Isaac Newton, I believe.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />I think you're right! So that's the zero conditional. Let's compare it with an example of the first conditional. Finn.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finn&nbsp;<br /></strong><strong>If you drop that glass, it'll break.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>And once again:</p>
<p><strong>Finn&nbsp;<br /></strong><strong>If you drop that glass, it'll break.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Now, in this sentence the <strong>if</strong> plus present simple part gives us a possible future situation. The other part is made with <strong>will</strong> plus an <strong>infinitive</strong> <strong>without 'to'</strong> and it gives us the result of this possible future situation.</p>
<p><strong>Finn &nbsp;<br /></strong><strong>If you drop that glass</strong>...</p>
<p><strong>If you drop that glass</strong>...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>And this is only a possible situation.</p>
<p><strong>Finn &nbsp;<br /></strong>...<strong>it'll break.</strong></p>
<p>...<strong>it'll break.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />And this is the result of the situation. We use <strong>will</strong> to show we are certain that the glass will break. But it only breaks if we drop the glass.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />When we are less certain of the result we can use <strong>might</strong>, like this:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Finn &nbsp;<br /></strong>If you drop the glass, it <strong>might</strong> break.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>And once again:</p>
<p><strong>Finn &nbsp;<br /></strong>If you drop the glass, it <strong>might</strong> break.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />It's sometimes difficult to choose between the zero and first conditional. It helps to remember that as well as using the zero conditional for truths, we also use it for general situations. If you're talking about a specific situation, or a one-off situation, the first conditional is probably best. For example, to describe a general situation that is true for everyone, we can use the zero conditional to say:</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong><strong>If you sit in the sun too long, you get burned.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>But if your friend is about to go sunbathing, perhaps without any sun cream, you can use the first conditional to talk about that specific situation and its possible result, like this:</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong><strong>If you sit in the sun too long, you will get burned.</strong></p>
<p><strong>IDENT &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>6 Minute Grammar from BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>And it's quiz time! Are these sentences grammatically correct, or wrong? Here's the first one: When we're older, we'll go travelling.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />OK, this first conditional sentence is correct.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Good. Here's another one: If plants don't get water, they die.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />This sentence is correct too.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />OK, get ready for the last sentence: If I fail my exams again, I feel terrible.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />And that's wrong. It's a specific situation and it's describing a possibility, not a certainty. So we need the first conditional. Here's the correct sentence:<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp; <br />If I fail my exams again, I<strong> will </strong>feel terrible.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Now, before we go, there's just enough time for a top tip. The first conditional only has one 'will'. So this sentence is wrong:</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp; <br />If <strong>they will leave </strong>now, they'll be home for lunch.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />You need to use present simple without will in the <strong>if</strong> part. Here's the correct version:</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp; <br />If <strong>they leave </strong>now, they'll be home for lunch.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Thank you Finn. So that's the zero conditional, with the present tense in both parts, for things which always happen.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />And that's the first conditional with <strong>if</strong> plus present simple, together with <strong>will</strong>, plus an infinitive, for possible future situations.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />There's more about this on our website at <a href=""http://www.bbclearningenglish.com"">bbclearningenglish.com</a>. Join us again for more 6 Minute Grammar.</p>
<p><strong>Both</strong>&nbsp;<br />Bye.</p>

"<div class=""text""dir=""ltr"">
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me Finn.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>And me Catherine. In today's programme we're having a look at modal verbs.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>Now modal verbs are used in a lot of different ways but in this programme we&rsquo;re looking at the modal verbs we use when we're talking about things we think are possible or true &ndash; both in the present and in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>That's right. When we don't know something for sure, we often make guesses. And modal verbs can express how sure or unsure we are about our guesses. We'll give you lots of examples&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>And we&rsquo;ll check what you've learned in our quiz.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>But first, we're listening to Fiona, who is a science reporter. And Fiona is talking about some ancient fossils that were found in China and Taiwan.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>While you listen, think about this question: Are the fossils from humans?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br /></strong><strong>Fiona<br /></strong>The research teams analysing fossils found in China and Taiwan&nbsp;<strong>could be looking</strong>&nbsp;at something very important. It seems that the fossils&nbsp;<strong>can't be</strong>&nbsp;from any known human species. They&nbsp;<strong>might be</strong>&nbsp;the result of breeding between species or they&nbsp;<strong>may belong</strong>&nbsp;to an unknown human species. The fossils suggest that before modern humans arrived in Asia, more diverse human groups&nbsp;<strong>may have lived</strong>&nbsp;there than previously thought.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>So that was Fiona. And we asked you: Are the fossils from humans?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>And the answer is: Maybe. They&nbsp;<strong>might be</strong>&nbsp;the result of breeding between species or they&nbsp;<strong>may belong</strong>&nbsp;to an unknown human species.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>So we don't know the answer for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>Exactly. Now the modal verbs&nbsp;<strong>might</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>may&nbsp;</strong>plus an infinitive show that we're talking about a present possibility, not a certainty. The modal verb&nbsp;<strong>could</strong>&nbsp;does this too, either with an infinitive or with a continuous form. Here's an example.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br /></strong>The research teams analysing fossils found in China and Taiwan&nbsp;<strong>could be looking</strong>&nbsp;at something very important&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>In fact, we can say&nbsp;<strong>could be looking, might be looking</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>may be looking</strong>&nbsp;there.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>That's right: it's a modal verb plus the continuous form of&nbsp;<strong>be</strong>&nbsp;plus&nbsp;<strong>verb&ndash;ing</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>But what about this sentence? Listen.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br /></strong>It seems that the fossils&nbsp;<strong>can't be</strong>&nbsp;from any known human species.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>Fiona uses the modal&nbsp;<strong>can&rsquo;t&nbsp;</strong>there. Now we use&nbsp;<strong>can't&nbsp;</strong>with an infinitive when we believe strongly that something isn't possible. The researchers believe strongly that the fossils don't belong to any known human species. They&nbsp;<strong>can't</strong>&nbsp;come from a known human species &ndash; it's not possible.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>So they&nbsp;<strong>must be</strong>&nbsp;from an unknown human species.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>That's right.&nbsp;<strong>Must&nbsp;</strong>or<strong>&nbsp;can't&nbsp;</strong>plus an infinitive both help us to express a strong belief that something is or isn't possible.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>When we're less sure about something, we can say, for example, the fossils&nbsp;<strong>might not, mightn&rsquo;t&nbsp;</strong>or<strong>&nbsp;may not be</strong>&nbsp;from a known human species.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>That's right, but don&rsquo;t use the negative&nbsp;<strong>couldn't</strong>&nbsp;like this. It's different.&nbsp;<strong>Couldn't</strong>&nbsp;plus an infinitive means that something is completely impossible. Right then. Now let's look at possibilities and certainties in the past. Here's the next clip.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 3<br /></strong>The fossils suggest that before modern humans arrived in Asia, more diverse human groups&nbsp;<strong>may have lived</strong>&nbsp;there than previously thought.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>So we can also use&nbsp;<strong>might, may, could, can't</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>must</strong>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<strong>have</strong>&nbsp;and the past participle of the verb when we think something was possible in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>Yes, we can say&nbsp;<strong>may have lived, might have lived&nbsp;</strong>or<strong>&nbsp;could have lived</strong>&nbsp;to express past possibility.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>And we use<strong>&nbsp;can't&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>must&nbsp;</strong>with&nbsp;<strong>have</strong>&nbsp;and the past participle when we're&nbsp;<strong>certain</strong>&nbsp;about something in the past. For example,&nbsp;<strong>t</strong><strong>he scientists can't have expected to find anything so important</strong>.<strong> &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>Exactly.&nbsp;<strong>They must have been very excited</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>I'm sure they were!</p>
<p><strong>IDENT</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />6 Minute Grammar from BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>And we're talking about modal verbs.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>And it's quiz time! For each of these sentences, choose&nbsp;<strong>might</strong>,<strong> must</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>can&rsquo;t</strong>&nbsp;to fill the gap: Number one: Finn, you got an A grade in physics? Wow. You _____ have studied really hard.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>And the answer is&nbsp;<strong>must</strong>. You must have studied really hard. I did Catherine.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br />Very good, Finn! Number two: Nick just called. He is stuck in traffic: he _____ be late.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br />And this one is&nbsp;<strong>might</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>He might be late</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>Well done! Number three: You _____ have seen a ghost. There's no such thing.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>And the answer is&nbsp;<strong>can't.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>You can&rsquo;t have seen a ghost.&nbsp;</strong>There's no such thing. Is there Catherine?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>I don't think so, Finn. What about you?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br /></strong>No.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>We don&rsquo;t believe in ghosts. And that's the end of the quiz. I hope you got them all right. &nbsp;</p>

"<div class=""text""dir=""ltr"">
<p><strong>Rob</strong><strong><br /></strong>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Rob.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine <br /></strong>And me, Catherine. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Today we're talking about the past perfect tense.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine <br /></strong>Yes, the past perfect. When we want to talk about two things that happened at different times in the past, we can use the past perfect tense - that's a subject with <strong>had</strong> plus the <strong>past participle</strong>. And here's Harry with our first example:</p>
<p><strong>Harry &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong><strong>Mary rang John's doorbell at 8.15 yesterday, but John had gone to work.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>And let's hear that again.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Harry &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong><strong>Mary rang John's doorbell at 8.15 yesterday, but John had gone to work.</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Thanks Harry. Now we could put these two events in the past simple tense, something like this:</p>
<p><strong>Harry &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong><strong>John went to work. Then Mary rang John's doorbell.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>And once again Harry.</p>
<p><strong>Harry &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong><strong>John went to work. Then Mary rang John's doorbell.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Or, we can change the order of events in the sentence, and use the past perfect - that's <strong>had </strong>with a <strong>past participle</strong> - to show which event actually happened first.</p>
<p><strong>Harry &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong><strong>Mary rang John's doorbell at 8.15 yesterday, but John had gone to work.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>And once again.</p>
<p><strong>Harry &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong><strong>Mary rang John's doorbell at 8.15 yesterday, but John had gone to work.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />And here, the past perfect in <strong>John had gone</strong> shows that this happened before the past simple phrase <strong>Mary rang John's doorbell</strong>. So we have: <strong>Mary rang John's doorbell at 8.15 yesterday, but John had gone to work.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Exactly. Now, let's look at some more examples.</p>
<p><strong>Harry &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong><strong>I was pleased when I got a text from Jim, because I'd lost his number.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>Let's hear that again.</p>
<p><strong>Harry &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong><strong>I was pleased when I got a text from Jim, because I'd lost his number.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />So we've got two past events. First, Harry lost Jim's number; then he got his text. But in Harry's sentence, the event that happened first in time is mentioned second in the sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Rob &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>So he uses the past perfect - <strong>I'd lost his number</strong> - to show that the second event he mentions, actually happened first.</p>
<p><strong>Harry &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong><strong>I was pleased when I got a text from Jim, because I'd lost his number.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Now in spoken English, the past perfect can sometimes be difficult to hear.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Yes that's true - in our example just now, the two words <strong>I had</strong> are shortened to <strong>I'd</strong>. I'd lost his number.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />So <strong>had</strong> is shortened to just a /d/ sound. Listen out for the short /d/ sound in this next example:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Harry &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong><strong>When Mrs Brown opened the washing machine she realised she'd washed her phone.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>And again.</p>
<p><strong>Harry &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong><strong>When Mrs Brown opened the washing machine she realised she'd washed her phone.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br />Did you catch that?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br /></strong>First, Mrs Brown washed her phone in the washing machine. Then she opened the washing machine. Then she realised... She'd washed her phone!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>Yes, and the phrase <strong>she had washed</strong> is shortened to <strong>she'd washed</strong>. One more time please Harry.</p>
<p><strong>Harry &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong><strong>When Mrs Brown opened the washing machine she realised she'd washed her phone.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Oops - that's an expensive mistake. Poor Mrs Brown!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Yeah, she won't do that again!</p>
<p><strong>IDENT &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong>6 Minute Grammar from bbclearningenglish.com.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br /></strong>Now for a quiz. I'm going to say some sentences and, as you listen, try to decide what happened first, and what happened second. Here's the first one. <strong>I woke up late because I'd forgotten to set the alarm.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />OK, so the past perfect here is <strong>I'd forgotten</strong>, and the order of events was: first, I forgot to set the alarm, and second, I woke up late. Here it is again.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Harry &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong><strong>I woke up late because I'd forgotten to set the alarm.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Great. Another one: <strong>I hadn't brought a towel, so I couldn't have a shower.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />How embarrassing. OK, and we've got the negative of had, which is <strong>hadn't</strong>. So first, I didn't bring a towel, and second, I couldn't have a shower. Here it is again.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong><strong>I hadn't brought a towel, so I couldn't have a shower.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Good. And for the last one: <strong>When they got to the station, they realised they'd left the tickets at home.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rob &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>This one has three events: first, they left the tickets at home. Second, they got to the station. And third, they realised that the tickets were at home.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>Yes and the past perfect phrase <strong>they had left</strong>, was shortened to <strong>they'd left</strong> - which helps us show that order.</p>
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong><strong>When they got to the station, they realised they'd left the tickets at home.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Now, a mistake people sometimes make with the past perfect is: they use it too much, or they use it just because they are talking about something that happened a long time ago. Such as...</p>
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong><strong>Jackie had gone to a football match last month.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Yes - there's only one past event here, so we probably just need the past simple tense:</p>
<p><strong>Harry<br /></strong><strong>Jackie went to a football match last month.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong>So that's the past perfect. It's made of <strong>had</strong> plus the <strong>past participle</strong> and we mainly use it to talk about a past event that happened before another past event.</p>

"<div class=""text"" dir=""ltr"">
<p><span><strong>Neil</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></span><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Neil. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></span><span>And me, Finn.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Neil</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></span><span>Today’s programme is all about the future perfect continuous tense.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>We’ll tell you when to use it…</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>How to form it…</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>And how it differs from the future perfect tense.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Let’s start with an example of the future perfect:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>This time next year, I’ll have finished my course.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Here, the action - finishing the course - will be completed before a particular time in the future – this time next year.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>OK. And now for the future perfect continuous:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>In January, I’ll have been studying for three years.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Here, the action – studying - goes right up to the specified time and will probably continue afterwards.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>So, we use the future perfect continuous rather than the future perfect when we want to focus on the continuous nature of the activity and how long it will be going on for. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>We often use the future perfect continuous with <strong>for </strong>plus an amount of time. So, in the earlier example, we had <strong>for three years</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Let’s have some more examples of the future perfect continuous:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>Tomorrow <strong>I’ll have been working </strong>here for six months.</span></p>
<p><span>In July <strong>we’ll have been living</strong> in Dubai for two years.</span></p>
<p><span>By the time the bus gets here, <strong>we’ll have been waiting</strong> over an hour.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Notice that the last example didn’t have <strong>for</strong>, as we don’t always have to include it.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Now, we usually use a time phrase with both tenses to state the particular time in the future. These often start with <strong>by</strong> or <strong>in</strong>. Listen to these examples: </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span><strong>By 2020</strong> the city’s population will have doubled.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>In June</strong> I’ll have been unemployed for five months.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>You can use <strong>by </strong>or <strong>in</strong>… with any future day, date, month, season or special day.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>For the future perfect continuous, the time phrases sometimes begin with <strong>in </strong>or <strong>on</strong>:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span><strong>On Sunday</strong>, he’ll have been travelling for three weeks.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong></span><span>We often use <strong>when</strong> or <strong>by the time </strong>in time phrases with both tenses. Listen to these examples:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob <br>When your train gets in</strong>, we’ll have been waiting for over two hours.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>By the time you get</strong> home, the chicken will have been cooking for two hours.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>By the time you get back</strong>, we’ll have had dinner.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Notice that <strong>when </strong>and<strong> by the time </strong>are followed by a verb. This verb is in the present simple, not the future. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Now, as well as predicting future events and situations, we can also use the future perfect and future perfect continuous to say what we imagine might or might not have happened:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>They <strong>won’t have arrived</strong> yet. They only left twenty minutes ago.</span></p>
<p><span>Sam didn’t come home last night.<strong> He’ll have been working </strong>all night to finish his report. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>In the first example, we assume that they haven’t arrived yet, based on the knowledge that they only left 20 minutes ago.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>And in the second example, we imagine that Sam has been working all night because he didn’t come home last night.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>We form the future perfect with <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>will </strong>or<strong> won’t </strong>plus <strong>have </strong>and the <strong>past participle </strong>of the main verb.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>By the summer <strong>I’ll have finished</strong> all my exams.</span></p>
<p><span>The film <strong>won’t have started</strong> yet.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>For the future perfect continuous, it’s <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>will </strong>or <strong>won’t</strong> plus <strong>have</strong> plus <strong>been</strong> plus the <strong>present participle</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br></strong></span><span>They <strong>won’t have been watching</strong> the match as they are on holiday.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>For future perfect questions, it’s <strong>will</strong> or <strong>won’t</strong> plus <strong>subject </strong>plus <strong>have</strong> plus the <strong>past participle</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span><strong>Will you have managed </strong>to read all the reports by this afternoon?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Asking questions in the future perfect continuous is more usually done with question tags, so the order is the same as for statements.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>He <strong>won’t have been working</strong> all day, will he?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Question words can also be used in which case it’s <strong>will</strong> plus <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>have</strong> plus <strong>been</strong> plus <strong>present participle</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span><strong>What will they have been talking</strong> about?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>IDENT<br></span></strong><span>6 Minute Grammar from BBC Learning English</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn <br></span></strong><span>We're talking about the future perfect continuous tense. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>To recap, we use the future perfect continuous to talk about something that will be going on at a particular time in the future…</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Or to say what we assume has or hasn’t already happened. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Now it's time for our quiz. Which is correct a or b. Are you ready?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Let's go.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Number one. a) It’s only six o’clock. They won’t have arrived yet. b) It’s only six o’clock. They won’t have been arriving yet. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong> <span> <br>And this one is a). </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>Correct. Number two. a) On Tuesday I’ll have been worked here for two years. b) On Tuesday I’ll have been working here for two years. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>And this one is b).</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong><span>That’s right. Finally, number three. a) When you will visit, we’ll have been living here for six months. b) When you visit, we’ll have been living here for six months.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Finn</strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></strong></span><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Finn. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></span></strong><span>And me, Catherine. Hello.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></span><span>In today’s programme we’re talking about three different verb patterns. First, what exactly do we mean by verb patterns, Catherine?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine <br></span></strong><span>Well, here we mean the various language patterns that follow the main verb in a clause or sentence. And the first pattern we’re looking at is verbs which are followed by <strong>that. </strong>Here’s our first example:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Example<br></span></strong><span>My doctor<strong> explained that </strong>I had to go to hospital<strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>My doctor<strong> explained that </strong>I had to go to hospital<strong>. </strong>So, we have a verb –<strong> explain, </strong>plus<strong> that,</strong> and did you notice that the word <strong>that</strong> is followed by an independent clause? In other words, it's followed by a group of words with a subject and verb, just like like a full sentence. In our example the independent clause was: <strong>I had to go to hospital</strong>. Now, other verbs that take this pattern include <strong>say</strong>,<strong> warn</strong>,<strong> explain</strong>,<strong> suggest </strong>and<strong> know</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Right. The second pattern is verbs that are followed by the i-n-g form, or&nbsp;<strong>-ing</strong> form of another verb. Let's have an example.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Example<br></span></strong><span>We<strong> discussed waiting </strong>until next year.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Now, lots of verbs take this pattern, including <strong>advise</strong>,<strong> try</strong>,<strong> love</strong>,<strong> like</strong>,and<strong> hate</strong>. And the third pattern is verbs that are followed by the <strong>infinitive with to</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Example<br></span></strong><span>He<strong> offered to see </strong>me again in a month’s time.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>And verbs that take this pattern include <strong>want</strong>, <strong>need</strong>, <strong>hope</strong>, <strong>love</strong> and <strong>promise</strong>. But it’s important to know that with some verbs, you can choose between two of the patterns. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>You can. So with the verbs <strong>suggest </strong>and<strong> recommend</strong> you can choose between <strong>that plus a clause</strong> or an <strong>–ing</strong> form. Here's an example:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Example<br></span></strong><span>We <strong>suggest that</strong> you go to the hospital in Oxford.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Or:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Example<br></span></strong><span>We <strong>suggest going</strong> to the hospital in Oxford.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>And with the verbs <strong>ask</strong>,<strong> propose </strong>and <strong>promise</strong>, you can choose between either <strong>that </strong>plus a clause, or the <strong>infinitive with</strong> <strong>to</strong>. Another example:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Example<br></span></strong><span>I <strong>promised that</strong> I would let him know my decision.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Or:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Example<br></span></strong><span>I <strong>promised to let</strong> him know my decision.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong></span><span>A good grammar book will give you a full list of verbs that take more than one pattern. Make sure you keep one handy!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Top tip. Now, another point is that some of these verbs can take an object before the <strong>infinitive with</strong> <strong>to</strong>. The verb<strong> ask </strong>is a good example. Listen to this:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Example<br></span></strong><span>I <strong>asked the doctor to change </strong>my medication.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>IDENT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></span></strong><span>This is bbclearningenglish.com</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></span></strong><span>And we’re looking at verb patterns. Well, we’ve said that some verbs can have an object </span><span>before the <strong>infinitive with</strong> <strong>to</strong>. But there are a few verbs that must <strong>always</strong> have an object before the <strong>infinitive with</strong> <strong>to</strong>. The verbs <strong>advise</strong>,<strong> invite</strong>,<strong> tell</strong> and <strong>warn</strong> are like this.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Example<br></span></strong><span>He <strong>advised me to think</strong> carefully about it. He <strong>told me not to</strong> hurry.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Right. Actually that last example is an interesting one. It shows that when you use a negative </span><span>form with the infinitive, the word <strong>not</strong> goes before, not after, the infinitive with <strong>to</strong>. Like this&nbsp;– He <strong>told me not to hurry.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong></span><span>Good point. The verbs <strong>advise</strong>,<strong> ask </strong>and<strong> warn</strong> are like that too, aren’t they? He <strong>advised </strong></span><span><strong>me not to worry</strong>, for example.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Yes, that’s right. Of course, you can use <strong>not</strong> before <strong>-ing</strong> forms as well. Listen to this:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Example<br></span></strong><span>They <strong>recommend not eating</strong> a big meal in the evening.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>But infinitives are a bit different because you lose the word <strong>to</strong> in the negative. So it’s </span><span>possible to say:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Example <br></strong>They <strong>recommend that you not eat</strong> a big meal in the evening.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>But that sounds very formal. We usually use <strong>don’t</strong> instead of <strong>not</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Example<br></span></strong><span>They <strong>recommend that you don’t eat</strong> a big meal in the evening.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>OK, by now you have probably noticed that most of the verbs we are talking about belong to a particular type.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Exactly. They are mostly verbs that explain, suggest, advise, offer, promise, report or warn.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Try to look out for these verbs and you’ll soon get to know which patterns you need to </span><span>use.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></span><span>And now: it’s quiz time! Which sentence is correct? a) Carl explained me he would be late home. b) Carl explained that he would be late home.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br></strong></span><span>b) is correct. Carl explained that he would be late home. Number 2. Which is correct? a) Which day do you advise us to come? b) Which day do you advise that we come?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Aha. Both a) and b) are correct! </span></p>

"<div class=""text"" dir=""ltr"">
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong></span><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Finn. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>Sorry I'm so late, Finn. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Oh Rob… OK.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>There was such a long queue at the coffee machine. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong></span><span>Ah<strong> so late</strong>…<strong>such a long queue</strong> – great examples for today's topic, Rob.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br></strong></span><span>Yes. Thank you very much. Yes, we’re talking about <strong>so, such, too</strong> and <strong>enough</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>When Rob said he was <strong>so late,</strong> he meant he was <span>very</span> late. Now Helen has some more examples using <strong>so</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Helen<br></strong></span><span>This coffee is so good.<br></span><span>Finn speaks English so well.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong></span><span>So it's<strong> so</strong> before an adjective – This coffee is <strong>so good</strong>…<strong> so strong</strong>…<strong> so hot</strong>… </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br></strong></span><span>Sounds good. Or before an <strong>adverb</strong>: He speaks English <strong>so well</strong>…<strong> so fluently</strong>…<strong> so fast</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong></span><span>And we use <strong>such</strong> with a noun. Rob said there was <strong>such a long queue</strong>, meaning </span><span>the queue was very long. Here are more examples.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Helen<br></span></strong><span>My holiday was such fun!<br></span><span>My holiday was such a disaster!</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br></strong></span><span>We say <strong>such</strong> <strong>fun </strong>without the indefinite article <strong>a </strong>because fun is uncountable.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong></span><span>But it's <strong>such a</strong> <strong>disaster</strong> with the article because <strong>disaster </strong>is countable.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br></strong></span><span>Now we often use <strong>such </strong>with an adjective <span>and</span> a noun together. Listen to this.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Helen<br></strong></span><span>Adele has such an amazing voice.<br></span><span>We had such good weather in Greece. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br></strong></span><span>So it's <strong>such</strong> good weather… <strong>such</strong> an amazing voice. Remember: with countable nouns </span><span>put the <strong>a</strong> or <strong>an</strong> <span>after</span> 'such' not before. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong></span><span>Nowadays, you sometimes hear people use <strong>so</strong> with a <strong>noun</strong> or <strong>verb </strong>for emphasis. Like this.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Helen<br></span></strong><span>That dress is so last year.<br></span><span>I'm so going to hug her when I see her.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong></span><span>So if you say<strong> 'so last year'</strong> it means <span>really</span> not fashionable any more. <strong>So going to hug her</strong> means really going to give her a really good hug.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br></strong></span><span>We can use <strong>so</strong> and <strong>such</strong> with a <strong>that clause</strong> to describe cause and effect. Like this.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Helen<br></span></strong><span>It was so hot that they had to go indoors.<br></span><span>It was such a hot day that they had to stay indoors.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong></span><span>And we can leave <strong>that</strong> out, so we could say: <strong>It was so hot they had to go indoors</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rob<br></strong></span><span>We also use <strong>so</strong> with <strong>many</strong> or <strong>much</strong> and a noun to describe a lot of something. It's </span><span><strong>so much</strong> with<strong> uncountable nouns</strong> and <strong>so many</strong> with <strong>countable nouns</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Helen<br></span></strong><span>What a great party! I had <strong>so much</strong> <strong>fun</strong>.<br></span><span>We visited <strong>so many places</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>So that's <strong>so</strong> and <strong>such</strong>. Now for <strong>too</strong> and <strong>enough</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>Yes. Now we use<strong> enough</strong> with an adjective or adverb to say something is or isn't the right degree. So, if I ask Finn: <strong>Are you warm enough, Finn? </strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>I am, thanks.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>I'm asking if it's the right temperature for you.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Notice <strong>enough</strong> comes <span>after</span> the adjective or adverb. We can also use <strong>enough</strong> after a verb.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Helen<br></span></strong><span>He doesn't <strong>sleep enough</strong>. He's always tired.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>When we use <strong>enough</strong> with a noun, it goes <span>before</span> the noun. We have <strong>enough food, enough time</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>And sentences with <strong>enough</strong> are sometimes followed by <strong>to </strong>and a<strong> verb.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Helen<br></span></strong><span>She's definitely <strong>smart enough</strong> <strong>to become</strong> director.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>You know Rob, I think that's enough about enough!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>Indeed. Now to say there's more than necessary, we use <strong>too</strong> with an adjective or adverb. So we could say this office is <strong>too crowded, too noisy, too busy</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>And I could say Rob that you're working <strong>too hard</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>Thank you very much. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>You work very hard.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>We can use <strong>too much</strong> or <strong>too many</strong> with a<strong> noun </strong>to say we have more than we need.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Helen<br></span></strong><span>Ugh! You've put<strong> too much sugar </strong>in my tea!<br></span><span>I ate <strong>too many biscuits</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>IDENT<br></span></strong><span>6 Minute Grammar from BBC Learning English.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>And I think we have just enough time for a quiz. OK so which is correct, a or b? Are you ready Rob?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>I am.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>OK. Number one. a) That's a so cute dog! b) That's such a cute dog.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>Well it's b) because it's <strong>such</strong> with an adjective and noun and the indefinite article comes after not before.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>That's correct. Number 2. a) Is there money enough? Or b) Is there enough money?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>Well, that's b) again because enough goes before a noun.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Correct. And finally, number 3. a) I can't afford it. It's too expensive. Or b) I can't afford it. It's so expensive.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rob<br></span></strong><span>You're trying to trick me. Both are correct.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Of course. That's right. Well done if you got them all right at home. And there's lots more about this on our website at bbclearningenglish.com. Join us again for more 6 Minute Grammar.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Both<br></span></strong><span>Bye.</span></p>

<p><strong>Callum</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Callum. <br> <br> <strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> And me, Catherine. <br> <br> <strong>Callum</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> Today we’re focussing on <strong>participle clauses</strong>.<br> <br> <strong>Catherine<br> </strong>Yes, that’s clauses that begin with <strong>present</strong> or <strong>past participles</strong>.<br> <br> <strong>Callum</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> We’ll find out what they are and how to use them.<br> <br> <strong>Catherine<br> </strong>And there’ll be lots of examples and also a quiz. Before we start though Callum, are you all right?<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>What do you mean?<br> <br> <strong>Catherine<br> </strong>Well you’ve got little bits of tissue stuck on your face.<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>Oh that, you noticed.<br> <br> <strong>Catherine<br> </strong>Well, it’s hard to miss them really.<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>I cut myself <strong>shaving</strong>.<strong><br> <br> Catherine<br> </strong>I see, that’s convenient.<strong><br> <br> Callum<br> </strong>Not really, it hurt.<br> <br> <strong>Catherine<br> </strong>But it did give you a perfect example of <strong>a present participle clause</strong>, which is today’s topic.<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>Yes it did! Let’s use that then as our first example. I cut myself <strong>shaving</strong>. First though, let’s remind everyone what a present participle is:<br> <br> <strong>Catherine<br> </strong>Sure. The present participle is <strong>the -ing form</strong> of the verb. We use it to form the continuous verb forms. So if the infinitive is shave, the <strong>present participle</strong> is <strong>shaving</strong>.<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>The past continuous of shave is: “I was <strong>shaving</strong>.”<br> <br> <strong>Catherine<br> </strong>And something happened while you were <strong>shaving</strong>, Callum<br> <br> <strong>Callum</strong><br> Yes, I cut myself. <br> <br> <strong>Catherine<br> </strong>You did. Now we can make a number of different sentences with this information. You could say:<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>I was <strong>shaving</strong> and I cut myself or: While I was <strong>shaving</strong> I cut myself.<br> <br> <strong>Catherine <br> </strong>Let’s just swap those clauses around<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>I cut myself while I was <strong>shaving</strong>.<br> <br> <strong>Catherine<br> </strong>OK, now because the subject of each of those clauses is the same - you - we can make the sentence more efficient and sound more natural by not repeating the pronoun and auxiliary that goes with it.<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>I cut myself while <strong>shaving</strong>.<br> <br> <strong>Catherine<br> </strong>This is fine, but we can also leave out the conjunction – while. Which leaves us with:<br> <br> <strong>Callum</strong><br> I cut myself <strong>shaving</strong>.&nbsp; <br> <br> <strong>Catherine<br> </strong>So we can use this structure when two things happen at the same time.<br> &nbsp;<br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>Yes, lets have some more examples. Catherine, what were you doing last night?<br> <br> <strong>Catherine<br> </strong>I was <strong>sitting</strong> on the sofa. I was <strong>watching</strong> TV. So I can say: I was <strong>sitting</strong> on the sofa <strong>watching</strong> TV. Callum: What are we doing now?<br> <br> <strong>Callum</strong><br> We are in the studio. We are <strong>recording</strong> 6 Minute Grammar. We’re in the studio <strong>recording</strong> 6 Minute Grammar.<br> <br> <strong>STING<br> <br> Catherine<br> </strong>Today we’re talking about <strong>participle clauses</strong>.<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>We’ve looked at one way you can use a <strong>present participle clause;</strong>&nbsp;now let’s look at a <strong>past participle clause</strong>. First Catherine, let’s review what <strong>a past participle</strong> is.<br> <br> <strong>Catherine</strong><br> It’s the third form of the verb, so if you remember go, went, gone, or do, did, done; gone and done are the <strong>past participles</strong>. For regular verbs this is <strong>the -ed form</strong>. We use the <strong>past participle</strong> in perfect verb forms and also the passive. <br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>So how would we use a <strong>past participle clause</strong>?<br> <br> <strong>Catherine<br> </strong>Like <strong>present participle clauses,</strong> it’s a way of being more economical with language and avoiding repetition. Listen to these sentences. <br> <br> <strong>Neil</strong><br> The dog was <strong>hit</strong> by the car. It wasn’t hurt.<br> The dog that was <strong>hit</strong> by the car wasn’t hurt.<br> The dog <strong>hit</strong> by the car wasn’t hurt.<br> <strong><br> Catherine<br> </strong>So we started there with two sentences. Both contained clauses that had the same subject. We have <strong>the dog </strong>in the first sentence, and in the second it’s referred to with the pronoun <strong>it.<br> <br> Neil<br> </strong>The dog <strong>was hit</strong> by a car. <strong>It</strong> wasn’t hurt.<br> <br> <strong>Catherine</strong><br> We can the combine these into one sentence by using a relative clause.<br> <br> <strong>Neil<br> </strong>The dog<strong> that was hit</strong> by the car wasn’t hurt.<br> <br> <strong>Catherine<br> </strong>And we can further shorten this by leaving out the relative pronoun and the auxiliary that goes with it. This leaves us with:<br> <br> <strong>Neil<br> </strong>The dog <strong>hit</strong> by the car wasn’t hurt.<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>So effectively what we do is combine all the bits that identify the subject into one phrase.<br> <br> <strong>Catherine<br> </strong>Yes, it’s <strong>like a reduced relative clause</strong> that becomes the subject of the sentence. You can see this form quite regularly in warning notices in public places.<br> <br> <strong>Neil<br> </strong>Cars <strong>parked</strong> here will be clamped.<br> Bicycles <strong>chained</strong> to this fence will be removed.<br> <br> <strong>Catherine</strong><br> Cars <strong>parked</strong> here is a shortened version of: Cars <strong>which are parked</strong> here…<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>And bicycles <strong>chained</strong> here is a shortened version of: Bicycles<strong> which are chained </strong>here.<strong><br> <br> Catherine<br> </strong>That’s right.<br> <br> <strong>STING<br> <br> Callum<br> </strong>And now: quiz time. Join the two sentences together into one. Here’s number one:<br> <br> <strong>Catherine<br> </strong>I saw the cat. It was playing with a mouse.<br> I saw the cat. It was playing with a mouse.<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>And the answer is: I saw the cat playing with a mouse. Number two:<br> <br> <strong>Catherine<br> </strong>The gold was stolen from the bank. It was never found.<br> The gold was stolen from the bank. It was never found.<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>The answer is: The gold stolen from the bank was never found. And finally number three.<br> <br> <strong>Catherine<br> </strong>She made a lot of money. She was running her own company.<br> She made a lot of money. She was running her own company.<strong><br> <br> Callum<br> </strong>And the answer is: She made a lot of money running her own company. Well done if you got them all right.<br> <br> <strong>Catherine<br> </strong>And that’s all from us for this programme. There’s more about this topic on our website. <br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>Do join us again for more 6 Minute Grammar.<br> <br> <strong>Both<br> </strong>Bye</p>

<p><strong>Callum</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Callum. <br> <br> <strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> And me, Finn. <br> <br> <strong>Callum</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> Today’s programme is all about the future perfect verb form.<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>Yes, by the end of this programme, <strong>you</strong> <strong>will have learnt</strong> how and when to use this form.<br> <br> <strong>Callum</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> So there was our first example: <strong>you will have learnt...</strong><br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>You’ll hear lots more examples in the programme…<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>And we’ll have a quiz. Now, we usually use the future perfect to talk about an event that we predict or expect to happen or finish before a particular time in the future. Listen to this example from Feifei.<br> <strong><br> Feifei<br> </strong>By the time Christine arrives, <strong>we’ll have had</strong> dinner.<br> <strong><br> Callum<br> </strong>So <strong>we’ll have had, </strong>that’s<strong> we will have had - </strong>in the future perfect tells us that we will finish dinner before Christine gets back. We might be having dinner right up to just before she returns or we might finish it an hour before …<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>… but in any case, we will finish <strong>before</strong> she arrives. <br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>We are using the future perfect to make a prediction about the future. Here are some more examples.<br> <br> <strong>Feifei<br> </strong>This time next year, <strong>I will have finished</strong> my course.<br> Sales <strong>will have increased</strong> by 20 per cent by next January.<br> By 2020 the city’s population <strong>will have doubled</strong>.<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>Now we usually use a time phrase with the future perfect, often with <strong>by</strong> or <strong>in</strong>. Let’s hear examples with <strong>by</strong> again:<br> <br> <strong>Feifei<br> </strong>Sales will have increased by 20 per cent <strong>by next January</strong>.<br> <strong>By 2020</strong> the city’s population will have doubled.<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>And here are some more examples with a <strong>by</strong> time phrase. <br> <br> <strong>Feifei<br> By the summer</strong> I’ll have finished all my exams.<br> We’ll have moved house <strong>by Christmas</strong>.<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>So we had <strong>by next January, by 2020,</strong> <strong>by the summer</strong> and <strong>by Christmas</strong>. We can also say <strong>by the winter… by the end of the week…<br> </strong><br> <strong>Finn<br> …by next month </strong>or<strong> next year… by this time next week… &nbsp;<br> </strong><br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>In fact you can pretty well use <strong>by…</strong> with any future date, month, season or special day.<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>Very special day. Another time expression with <strong>by</strong> we can use with the future perfect is <strong>by the time that…</strong>plus a subject and verb. Listen to the example we had earlier, and check out the tense.<br> <br> <strong>Feifei<br> </strong>By the time Christine arrives, we’ll have had dinner.<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>It’s the present simple - <strong>arrives. </strong><br> <br> &nbsp;<strong>Callum<br> </strong>When we use <strong>in</strong> for a time phrase with the future perfect, we can use it with a day, a month, a date, a time period. Here are some examples.<strong><br> </strong><br> <strong>Feifei<br> In fifty years' time</strong>, sea levels will have risen by several centimetres.<br> <strong>In June</strong> I’ll have been unemployed for five months.<br> <strong>In 2050</strong>, I believe robots will have replaced sales assistants in shops.<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>As well as for future plans and predictions, we can also use the future perfect to talk about what we believe or imagine has or hasn’t happened at the moment of speaking…<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>…or in other words, to make educated guesses in the present about the past. Here are some examples.<br> <br> <strong>Feifei<br> </strong>There’s no point in calling Judy. <strong>She’ll have left </strong>by now.<br> Let’s hurry! The film <strong>won’t have started</strong> yet.<br> If he’s on schedule, Tom <strong>will have arrived in Bangkok </strong>yesterday.<br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>So we assume that Judy has already left….<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>And the film hasn’t started..&nbsp; <br> <br> <strong>Callum</strong><br> And Tom has arrived in Bangkok. <br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>Now, to form the future perfect we use <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>will </strong>or<strong> won’t </strong>plus <strong>have </strong>and the <strong>past participle </strong>of the main verb. <br> <br> <strong>Feifei<br> </strong>By the summer <strong>I’ll have finished</strong> all my exams.<br> The film <strong>won’t have started</strong> yet.<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>Notice that we usually use short forms, so it’s <strong>I’ll</strong>, <strong>he’ll</strong>, <strong>they’ll</strong> and so on; and <strong>will not</strong> becomes <strong>won’t</strong>. <br> <strong><br> Callum<br> </strong>For questions, it’s <strong>will</strong> or <strong>won’t</strong> plus <strong>subject </strong>plus <strong>have</strong> plus the <strong>past participle</strong>.<br> <br> <strong>Feifei<br> Will you have finished</strong> reading all the reports by this afternoon?<br> <strong><br> IDENT<br> </strong>6 Minute Grammar from BBC Learning English.<br> <br> <strong>Finn <br> </strong>We're talking about the future perfect verb form. <br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>So, to recap, we use the future perfect to predict events that will have happened before a particular time in the future…<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>…and to make educated guesses about things happening around now and even in the past. <br> <br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>And we usually use short forms.<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>So, it’s time for our quiz. Which is correct? Number one. a) By 2060, scientists will have found a cure for cancer. b) By 2060, scientists will found a cure for cancer. <br> <br> <strong>Callum</strong><br> It’s a)&nbsp;By 2060, scientists will have found a cure for cancer.<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>I hope so, now number 2. a) Jackie won’t have woken up yet. It’s too early. b) Jackie won’t have wake up yet. It’s too early.<br> &nbsp;<br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>It’s a) Jackie won’t have woken up yet. It’s too early.<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>Finally, number three. a) Will have you done all your work by two? b) Will you have done all your work by two?<br> <br> <strong>Callum</strong><br> And the answer is b) Will you have done all your work by two?<br> <br> <strong>Finn<br> </strong>That’s correct and it’s the end of the show.

<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Finn.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And me, Catherine. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>In this programme, we're talking about linking devices.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right! And there are lots of different kinds of linking devices, but today we're looking at ways of contrasting one idea with another.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>So, some words and phrases that do this are <strong>however</strong>, <strong>although</strong> and <strong>despite</strong>. We'll give you lots of information and examples…</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And of course there'll be a quiz to see what you've learnt.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>So, here we go, with our first example sentences from Neil:</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Dean and I were the best of friends. Sometimes we completely disagreed.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK. Now the ideas in those two sentences contrast with each other a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>The fact that they completely disagreed is slightly surprising or unexpected if they were the best of friends, isn't it?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>It depends on the friendship but yes, it could be true.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>It could be.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And to express this contrast clearly and in an interesting way, we can link the ideas in the sentences with the word <strong>but</strong>, like this:</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Dean and I were the best of friends, <strong>but</strong> sometimes we completely disagreed.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Or we can use the word <strong>however</strong>, like this:</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Dean and I were the best of friends. <strong>However</strong>, sometimes we completely disagreed.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Now, <strong>however </strong>doesn't make two sentences into one long sentence, like the word <strong>but </strong>does.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>No, as you heard, <strong>however </strong>usually goes at the start of a new sentence, or, we can sometimes put it at the end of a sentence, like this:</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Dean and I were the best of friends. Sometimes we completely disagreed, <strong>however</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Right. Now if we prefer to join the two sentences together into one longer sentence, we could use <strong>although</strong> or <strong>even though</strong>. And they express surprise more than <strong>however </strong>or<strong> but</strong>. Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Although</strong> Dean and I were the best of friends, sometimes we completely disagreed.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Good. The phrase <strong>even though</strong> works in exactly the same way. And you can use <strong>although</strong> and <strong>even though</strong> at the beginning or in the middle of this longer sentence:</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Dean and I were the best of friends, <strong>even though</strong> sometimes we completely disagreed.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT<br></strong>6 Minute Grammar from BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now let's take a look at <strong>despite</strong> and <strong>in spite of</strong>. They mean the same as each other but do they mean the same as <strong>although</strong> and <strong>even though</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Actually yes, they do. They're also used to link and contrast surprising or unexpected ideas and they can go at the beginning or in the middle of a sentence. But the grammar is slightly different. Listen:</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Despite</strong> being the best of friends, Dean and I sometimes completely disagreed.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>So:<strong> despite </strong>isfollowed by the -ing form of the verb, <strong>despite being</strong>, We don't use a subject and a verb after <strong>despite</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>And <strong>in spite of</strong> is the same. We can also use a noun phrase instead of an –ing verb. Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Despite</strong> our great friendship, Dean and I sometimes completely disagreed.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK. So the noun phrase after <strong>despite</strong> is <strong>our great friendship</strong>. And one more point about <strong>despite </strong>and <strong>in spite of</strong>. They can both be followed by the phrase <strong>the fact that </strong>plus a subject and a verb. Listen.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>In spite of the fact that</strong> Dean and I were the best of friends, sometimes we completely disagreed.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right. Now we'll finish with two more linking words, <strong>while </strong>and <strong>whereas</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes, these are a bit different. <strong>While </strong>and<strong> whereas </strong>are used mainly for contrasting facts. They don't usually express surprise or any other attitude. Examples please, Neil?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Whereas</strong> I studied zoology, Dean studied medieval history.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>So that's a fact! And again, these words can go at the beginning or in the middle of a sentence. So we could also say:</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>I studied zoology <strong>while</strong> Dean studied medieval history.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Very good. And now it's quiz time! Number one. Complete this sentence with either a) <strong>although</strong> or b)<strong>despite</strong>. We hardly ever saw our cousins _____ living very near each other.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answer is b) <strong>despite </strong>because it's followed by a verb-ing.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Number two. Fill the gap with either a) <strong>despite</strong> or b) <strong>although</strong>. Libraries are being closed _____ many people have protested against the move.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answer is b) <strong>although</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Number three. Fill the gap with either a) <strong>in spite of</strong> or b) <strong>whereas</strong>. Honey is supposed to be good for you _____ sugar is considered bad.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And it's b) <strong>whereas</strong>. Honey is supposed to be good for you <strong>whereas</strong> sugar is considered bad.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Well done! Congratulations if you got them right at home <strong>despite the fact that</strong> they were quite difficult!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well done indeed. There's more about this on our website at bbclearningenglish.com. Join us again for more 6 Minute Grammar.</p>

<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Callum <br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>And me, Finn</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>So Finn, what is our topic today?<br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>I don’t know.<br><br><strong>Callum<br></strong>Haven’t you read the script?<br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>No, when I come to the studio, I read the script, not before.<br><br><strong>Callum<br></strong>If you had read the script, you would know what it’s about. <strong><br><br></strong><strong>Finn<br></strong>Well if you give me a few minutes, I’ll just give it a quick read.<br><br><strong>Callum<br></strong>I’d love to give you a few minutes if we had the time. But this is 6 Minute Grammar, not 16 Minute Grammar.<br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>If I’d known you were going to be so bossy, I’d’ve stayed in bed.<br><br><strong>Callum<br></strong>Mmm. So what is today’s topic? If you’ve been paying attention, you might have worked it out.<br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>We’ve had a lot of ‘ifs’, that is a bit of a clue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><strong>Callum<br></strong>It is indeed. Today we’re reviewing conditionals. <br><br><strong>Finn &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Conditional sentences connect two things. One thing follows on from something else.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Conditional sentences generally have two parts, the <strong>conditional</strong> <strong>clause</strong>, which is sometimes called the <strong>if clause</strong>, and a <strong>main clause</strong>. The <strong>if clause</strong> states a condition and the <strong>main clause</strong> has what happens because of that condition.<br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>And there are different kinds of conditional structures depending on whether we’re dealing with something in the present or past and if we’re talking about something real or imagined. <br><br><strong>Callum<br></strong>We normally talk about four different conditional structures. The first one is called the zero conditional. Here’s an example from earlier. Let’s wind back a bit. <strong><br><br>[sfx: tape rewinding]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>When I come to the studio, I read the script.<br><br><strong>Callum<br></strong>Now Finn, what time does that refer to?<br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>It’s not really past, present or future, is it? It’s timeless. It’s always. <br><br><strong>Callum<br></strong>And this is what the zero conditional is for. Things that are always true, things that always happen. One thing happens, something else follows. <br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>It’s also commonly used for general truths and facts. Like in these examples.<br><br><strong>Feifei<br></strong><em>When you heat water enough, it boils.</em><br><em>If you leave milk out long enough, it goes bad.</em></p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>And in zero conditionals, <strong>when </strong>and <strong>if</strong> have the same meaning. Let’s move on now to the first conditional.<br><br><strong>[sfx: tape rewinding]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Well if you give me a few minutes, I’ll just give it a quick read.<br><br><strong>Callum<br></strong>Finn, what time does this refer to?<br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>This one is about something that might happen in the future. I’ll read the script.<br><br><strong>Callum<br></strong>Will that definitely happen?<br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>No, it’ll only happen after a particular condition is met, and that condition is that you give me enough time.<br><br><strong>Callum</strong><br>With the first conditional, you can use <strong>when</strong> as well as <strong>if</strong> but unlike the zero conditional, they do have different meanings. Listen to these examples.<br><br><strong>Feifei<br></strong><em>If I go to the shops, I’ll get some bread.</em><br><em>When I go to the shops, I’ll get some bread.</em></p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>So Finn: “If I go to the shops”. Am I definitely going to the shops?<br><br><strong>Finn</strong><br>No, not this time. It’s a possibility, but not definite.<br><br><strong>Callum<br></strong>And what about: “When I go to the shops”?<br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>In this one, using <strong>when</strong>, there is a definite plan to go to the shops.<br><br><strong>Callum<br></strong>So the first conditional expresses a likely result of a possible or definite future condition.<br><strong><br>IDENT &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>You’re listening to BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Today we’re reviewing different conditional forms. <br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>We’ve looked at zero and first conditionals, and it was Callum who gave us an example of the second conditional.<br><br><strong>[sfx: tape rewinding]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>I’d love to give you a few minutes if we had the time.<br><br><strong>Finn</strong><strong><br></strong>What time does this refer to, Callum?<br><br><strong>Callum<br></strong>It’s an imaginary present time – do we have the time now? No we don’t. It’s making a prediction about something that could be possible if something in the present were different. We’re imagining a different present reality.<br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>Wow. That's very sci-fi, Callum!<br><br><strong>Callum<br></strong>And now the third conditional. Let’s go back again and here the example.<strong><br><br>[sfx: tape rewinding]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>If I’d known you were going to be so bossy, I’d’ve stayed in bed.<br><br><strong>Callum<br></strong>Finn, what time are we talking about here?<br><br><strong>Finn</strong><br>We’re talking about the past, but something that didn’t happen in the past.<br><br><strong>Callum<br></strong>Yes, you didn’t know when you got up this morning that I was going to be so bossy.<br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>No, my past action would have been different, if I had known. I would have stayed in bed!<br><br><strong>Callum</strong><br>So with the third conditional were imagining a different past reality.<br><br><strong>Finn <br></strong>Very good. That’s right. Very sci-fi again Callum.<br><br><strong>Callum<br></strong>Now, just time for a quick quiz. You’re going to hear a sentence and you need to work out whether it’s a zero, first, second or third conditional. Here’s the first one:<br><br><strong>Finn</strong><br>If you drop the price, you’ll sell more.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>That’s first conditional. Here’s the next one:<br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>If I were you, I’d take the job.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>And that one is second conditional. What about this one?<br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>When I’ve had a busy day, I want some peace and quiet when I get home.<br><br><strong>Callum<br></strong>Did you get it? That was the zero conditional.<br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>Well done if you got all of those right. <br><br><strong>Callum<br></strong>If we had more time we could tell you a lot more about conditionals.<br><br><strong>Finn<br></strong>But we don’t, so we’re going to say goodbye for now, and remind you that there's&nbsp;more about this topic on our website <strong>bbclearningenglish.com</strong>. Do join us again soon for more 6 Minute Grammar.<br><br><strong>Both</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Bye.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Catherine.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>And me, Callum. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>In this programme we’re looking at the phrase <strong>used to</strong> for talking about the past.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>And we’re also looking at the phrases <strong>be used to</strong> and <strong>get used to</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now <strong>used to</strong> and <strong>be used to</strong> sound very similar, but the meaning and forms are different. So we’ll explain the differences and give you lots of examples.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>And we’ll have a quiz to see how much you’ve learnt, so let’s get started. Now <strong>used to</strong> is always followed by the infinitive of the verb. It tells us that an action happened regularly in the past but it doesn’t happen now. Here’s Rob with an example.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>I <strong>used to eat </strong>meat, but now I’m a vegetarian.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine&nbsp;<br></strong>And <strong>used to</strong> can also describe a past situation which is no longer true. Rob. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>I <strong>used to be </strong>a bit overweight, but I’m much slimmer now.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>That’s straightforward. So what about<strong> be used to </strong>or<strong> get used to? </strong>Well, if you<strong> are used to </strong>something, it means that it isn’t unusual or difficult for you because you have experienced it before. Rob.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>When I first became a vegetarian, I missed eating meat, but now I<strong>’m used to </strong>it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>So Rob’s familiar and comfortable with not eating meat now. He could also say:</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>I <strong>got used to</strong> it after a few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Yes, <strong>got</strong> is like <strong>became</strong>. He became familiar with it&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now in those examples, <strong>be used to </strong>and <strong>get used to </strong>are followed by the pronoun<strong> it. </strong>But we can also use the<strong> –ing form </strong>of a verb in the same position. Listen.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>I<strong>’m not used to eating </strong>food without salt. I find it really tasteless.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Rob’s not familiar with food without salt. I know how he feels - but doctors are advising us all to <strong>get used to eating</strong> less salt.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>I can’t get used to eating no salt on my chips.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>No, that’s just wrong. It’s wrong. So there’s <strong>used to</strong> with the infinitive and <strong>be </strong>or <strong>get used to</strong> with the <strong>-ing</strong> verb. Another difference is that <strong>used to</strong> is only for the past. There is no present or future form of <strong>used to</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>But we can use <strong>be</strong> or <strong>get used to</strong> in the present, past or future. Rob.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>In the past, British people <strong>weren’t used to eating</strong> pasta and pizza.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>That’s true. Pasta and pizza were new to Britain. But we all love them now don’t we?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, I think we<strong> got used to </strong>them pretty quickly! Even if we can’t have slat on them.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>You’re listening to BBC Learning English.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And we’re looking at the phrases <strong>used to</strong> and <strong>be</strong> or <strong>get used to</strong>. And there’s another difference between them.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Yes, with<strong> used to, </strong>we form questions, short answers and negatives with<strong> did </strong>and<strong> didn’t. </strong>And in questions and negatives,we lose the<strong> d </strong>on the end of<strong> used. </strong>You can’t hear this because we don’t pronounce the <strong>d</strong> on <strong>used</strong> anyway. But it’s important in writing. Here’s an example. Catherine, <strong>d</strong><strong>id you use to have </strong>rice and curry when you were a child!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>No, I <strong>didn’t</strong>. In fact <strong>we didn’t use to have</strong> foreign food at all in our house.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Neither did... I think the most foreign food we had was a Cornish Pasty.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Very British!</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>But with<strong> be used to </strong>and<strong> get used to, </strong>we form questions, short answers and negatives with the verb<strong> be. </strong>And we keep the<strong> d </strong>on the end of<strong> used. </strong>Catherine, <strong>are you used to buying </strong>international food now?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, I am, most definitely. There’s all sorts of foreign food here in London and I’ve tried most of it.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Just a couple more points. There are two alternative negative forms for <strong>used to</strong>. Instead of <strong>I didn’t use to</strong>, we sometimes say <strong>I never used to</strong> or <strong>I used not to.</strong> Listen</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>I never <strong>used to eat</strong> many vegetables.<br><strong>I used not to eat</strong> many vegetables.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Just remember that <strong>used not to</strong> sounds very formal, and is mainly used in writing nowadays. Now Catherine, are there any types of foreign food that you <strong>aren’t used to?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, I tried Japanese food a few times, but<strong> I can’t get used to it. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>And there is the modal auxiliary <strong>can’t</strong> with <strong>get used to</strong>. It’s a very useful piece of language. We can use it in the past as well. Rob?</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong><br>I <strong>couldn't get used to</strong> living in the countryside, so I moved back to the city.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And now it’s quiz time! Is this sentence correct or wrong? I’ve been in this job for three months so I used to it now. I’ve been in this job for three months so I used to it now.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>That’s not correct. It’s <strong>I’m used to it</strong>, with the verb <strong>be</strong>. Number two. <strong>D</strong><strong>id you use </strong>to living in London when you were a child?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>That’s wrong. The correct sentence is: Did you use to live in London? And number three. I don’t really like Japanese food but I hope I’ll be used to it.</p>
<p><strong>Callum <br></strong>That’s not correct. It should be <strong>I’ll get used to it</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>It should! Well done at home if you got those right.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>There’s more about this on our website at <a href=""http://www.bbclearningenglish.com"">bbclearningenglish.com</a>. Join us again for more 6 Minute Grammar.</p>
<p><strong>All</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Bye.&nbsp;</p>

"<div class=""text"" dir=""ltr"">
<p><strong>Callum</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Callum.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>And me, Catherine.</p>
<p><strong>Callum</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Today’s programme is about a couple of ways of talking about the future. The <strong>future continuous</strong> verb form and <strong>be</strong> plus the infinitive.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>So <strong>you’re to listen</strong> carefully…</p>
<p><strong>Callum</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Good example!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>Thank you. Let’s start with the future continuous. Here’s an example. This time next week, I’ll be sitting on a beach in Mallorca.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Lucky you! So, <strong>I’ll be sitting</strong>, in the future continuous, is an event that will be happening at a particular time in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>And I’ve already planned it. I used the time phrase <strong>this time next week</strong>. We can use other time phrases like …<strong>next year</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br> </strong>Or <strong>tonight</strong>, for example.We can also use the future continuous to say how long we’ll be doing something. So Catherine how long will you be staying in Mallorca?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>I’ll be staying in Palma <strong>for one week </strong>before travelling around the island.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br> </strong>So Catherine used the future continuous to say she plans to stay in Palma for <strong>a week.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>That’s right. Now w&nbsp; e can also use the future continuous to say we’ll be doing something while something else is happening… So, Callum, <strong>while you’re working </strong>at the BBC <strong>I’ll be</strong> <strong>sipping</strong> my cocktails by the hotel pool!</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br> </strong>Yes, notice that we usually use the present continuous in the time phrase after <strong>while</strong>… Catherine said <strong>while I’m working.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>We could use <strong>when </strong>instead of while, and follow it with the present simple.</p>
<p>Here’s an example.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>A taxi will be waiting when you arrive.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>STING</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>Today we’re looking at the future continuous to talk about future plans.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>But we use it for other things as well. For example, we can use the future continuous to make predictions. Here’s an example.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>Those clouds look very dark. It’ll be raining soon.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br> </strong>Rob knows it’ll be raining soon because the sky is very dark.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>We can also use the future continuous to say what we imagine to be true at the moment. Listen to this example.</p>
<p><strong>Rob&nbsp;<br></strong>You can’t ring Abdul now! It’s two o’clock in the morning in Dubai. <strong>He’ll be sleeping</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>We don’t know for certain that Abdul is sleeping, but it’s likely.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br> </strong>Sometimes we use the future continuous in a question when we want to be polite. Here’s an example</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> Will you be staying </strong>for dinner?</p>
<p><strong>STING</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br> </strong>We form the future continuous with <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>will </strong>or<strong> won’t </strong>plus <strong>be </strong>and the <strong>–ing form</strong> of the main verb. Here are some examples :</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>I’ll be sitting by the pool.<br>I won’t be taking any work with me.<br>They’ll be arriving after midnight.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>Notice that we usually use contracted forms, so I<strong>’ll</strong> …and <strong>won’t</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>For questions it’s <strong>will</strong> or <strong>won’t</strong> plus <strong>subject </strong>plus <strong>be</strong> plus the <strong>–ing</strong> form of the verb.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>Why will they be arriving so late tonight?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>So that’s the future continuous. Now let’s look at <strong>be</strong> plus <strong>the infinitive</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br> </strong>We sometimes use this to tell someone what they must or mustn’t do. Here are some examples.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>Students are to enter the hall from the back.<br>You’re not to go out without telling me!</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>We often find this structure in more formal English, for example to describe official arrangements.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are to visit Singapore next month.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>Or in media reports to say what will almost certainly happen. We form this structure with <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>be </strong>plus the<strong> infinitive with to. </strong>Listen to this example.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>A man is to appear in court later today charged with murder.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>For the negative it’s <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>be</strong> plus <strong>not</strong> plus the <strong>infinitive with to</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br> </strong>You are not to go to bed late tonight!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>And remember, we often use short forms like: <strong>You’re not </strong>and <strong>He isn’t…</strong></p>
<p><strong>IDENT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>We're talking about the <strong>future continuous</strong> tense and <strong>be plus the infinitive</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br> </strong>So, to recap, we use the future continuous to describe plans at a particular time in the future or for how long we’ll be doing something.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>We also use it for predictions…</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br> </strong>And for polite enquiries and to say what we assume is happening.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>We use <strong>be </strong>plus<strong> the infinitive </strong>for future events which involve instruction or necessity.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And for official arrangements or reports saying what will almost certainly happen.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Time for our quiz. Which is correct a or b. Ready?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br> </strong>Number one. a) I work in New York next summer or b) I’ll be working in New York next summer.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br> It’s b).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br> </strong>Correct. Number 2. a) Students are not to bring their cars to school. b) Students are not bring their cars to school.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>It’s a).</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br> </strong>That’s right. Finally, number three. a) I’ll be working hard while you relaxing in the sun. b) I’ll be working hard while you’re relaxing in the sun.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br> It’s b.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br> </strong>Correct and that’s the end of the programme. There's lots more about this on our website at bbclearningenglish.com. Join us again for more 6 Minute Grammar soon.</p>
<p><strong>Both<br></strong>Bye.&nbsp;</p>

"<div class=""text"" dir=""ltr"">
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Hello! Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Callum.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And me, Catherine. In this programme we’re talking about multi-word verbs.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Yes, these are verbs that are <strong>made up </strong>of more than one word. There is a main verb followed by one or two particles, which might be adverbs or prepositions.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Multi-word verbs are incredibly important. They're used all the time in spoken English and often in written English. So if you want to have a good understanding of English and want to be able to express yourself naturally, it’s a good idea to know your multi-word verbs.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>There are different types of multi-word verbs and today we’re looking at four types of prepositional verbs and phrasal verbs. And to keep things simpler we’ll refer to them all as phrasal verbs.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Let’s start with a clip from Dave. And Dave is talking about his holiday.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>And listen for the answer to this question: Why did Dave have to stay in bed?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Dave<br></strong>It wasn’t the holiday I was expecting. On the first day, I <strong>picked up</strong> a nasty bug. I think I <strong>picked it up</strong> from something I ate. Anyway, I had to stay in bed. It took me a few days to <strong>get over</strong> that. Then my girlfriend and I <strong>split up</strong>. Well, we hadn’t been <strong>getting along</strong> well for some time. &nbsp;I guess we just couldn’t <strong>put up with</strong> each other for any longer.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right, that was Dave using a lot of phrasal verbs. Now the question was: Why did Dave have to stay in bed, Callum?</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>And the answer is: Because he <strong>picked up</strong> a nasty bug.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, <strong>picked up</strong> is a phrasal verb that means <strong>caught </strong>here. He picked up a nasty bug: he caught an unpleasant illness.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>To <strong>pick up</strong> is an example of a type one phrasal verb. These phrasal verbs are transitive which means they always have an object. Without an object it doesn’t make sense so there has to be <strong>something</strong> that is <strong>picked up</strong>. In this example, the object of <strong>picked up</strong> is <strong>a nasty bug</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And with type 1 phrasal verbs, you can put the object after the particle or between the verb and the particle.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>So you can say <strong>I picked up a nasty bug</strong> or <strong>I picked a nasty bug up</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>But if you use an object pronoun like <strong>it</strong>, <strong>him, </strong>or<strong> her, </strong>it <strong>must</strong> go between the verb and the particle.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>As we heard Dave say about the bug, he <strong>picked it up</strong> from something he ate. Not he picked up it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Good. Now listen for another phrasal verb in this clip.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>It took me a few days to <strong>get over</strong> that.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now <strong>get over</strong> is our second type of phrasal verb. To get over something means to feel better after an illness or an upsetting event.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>It’s transitive too, so it always has an object but unlike type 1 phrasal verbs the object or the object pronoun must come after the particle.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right. You can’t separate the verb and the particle. Unlike Dave and his girlfriend! What phrasal verb does he use for that?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br></strong>Then my girlfriend and I <strong>split up</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right. It’s not very nice to <strong>split up</strong> on holiday, is it? And <strong>split up</strong> is a type three phrasal verb. What do we need to know about type threes, Callum?</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Well, they’re intransitive. That means that they don’t have an object and you can’t split the two parts of the phrasal verb.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Dave used another type three. Listen again.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 3<br></strong>Well, we hadn’t been <strong>getting along</strong> well for some time.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong><strong>Getting along</strong> is also intransitive. There’s no object. And what does it mean?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>If two people <strong>get along</strong> it means that they like each other and have a good relationship with each other.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Next clip please.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 4<br></strong>I guess we just couldn’t <strong>put up with</strong> each other for any longer.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And there’s our fourth type of phrasal verb. There are three parts to it. There’s <strong>put</strong> followed by the particles <strong>up</strong> and <strong>with</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>And there’s an object, <strong>each other</strong>. Like type two phrasal verbs the object must always come after the particles.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And finally some phrasal verbs are both type 3 and type 4.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Yes. Do you remember that Dave and his girlfriend hadn’t been <strong>getting along</strong>? Well, you could also say that they hadn’t been <strong>getting along with</strong> each other. We can sometimes extend the type three phrasal verbs to become type four. So Catherine, how do you know which type a phrasal verb is?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, if you see it or hear it being used, you can usually work it out but also a good dictionary will tell you whether it’s transitive or not. So I recommend whenever you note a new phrasal verb you also write down some examples and what type it is.</p>
<p><strong>STING</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>It’s quiz time! Number one: right or wrong? When Dave got ill, it took him a few days to get it over.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And that’s wrong. It should have been <strong>get over it</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Excellent! Number two: finish the sentence. Dave’s off work. a) He picked up a cold. b) He picked a cold up. c) both a) and b) are possible.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answer’s c), both a) and b) are possible.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Number three: Which is correct? a) Dave and I get along well. b) I get along well Dave. c) I get Dave along well.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answer's&nbsp;a) Dave and I get along well.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>It is! And brilliant, well done &nbsp;if you got them all right. &nbsp;</p>

"<div class=""text"" dir=""ltr"">
<p><strong>Finn</strong><strong>&nbsp; </strong><strong><span>&nbsp;<br></span></strong>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Finn.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></span></strong>And me, Catherine. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></span>In today’s programme we’re talking about narrative tenses…</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></span>Yes, narrative tenses. That means the past simple tense, the past continuous, the past perfect and the past perfect continuous.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></span>Yes, we use these tenses to describe events that happened in the past, and for telling stories.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></span>We’ll explain when to use each tense…</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>…we’ll give you lots of examples…</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></span>…and there’ll be quiz at the end of the show, so listen carefully! Let’s begin with the past&nbsp;simple. We use the past simple tense for events and actions that started and finished in the&nbsp;past. Here’s Mike with our first example.</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></span>I had a terrible day last Monday! It all started when I woke up late.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><span> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></span>So those three verbs: <strong>had</strong>, <strong>started</strong> and <strong>woke up</strong>, are all in the past simple, because they describe events which started and finished in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Now if Mike wants to describe the background to his story, or to talk about things that started before his story started, and continued through his story, he can use the past continuous tense, like this:</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></span>It all started when I woke up late. I opened the curtains. It was raining and the traffic was moving very slowly.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></span>So that’s <strong>it was raining</strong> and <strong>the traffic was moving</strong>, in the past continuous, to set the scene and describe past activities.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></span>We’ll come back to the past continuous a little later on, but first, let’s look at two more tenses. First, the past perfect. Mike.</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></span>When I looked at my phone, I realised I had slept through the alarm!</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></span>So, Mike used the past perfect <strong>I had slept </strong>with the past simple <strong>when I looked</strong> and another past simple <strong>I realised</strong> to show one past action happened before another one.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></span>That's right. So, first, Mike slept through his alarm, then he looked at his watch and realised. Mike swaps the order of events in his sentence, and uses the past perfect tense to signal that the second thing he talks about actually happened first. One more time please Mike?</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></span>When I looked at my phone, I realised I had slept through the alarm!</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>The past perfect continuous works in pretty much the same way, but this time for activities that continued for a length of time.</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></span>When I looked at my phone, I realised I had slept through the alarm. I had been sleeping like a log!</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>Mike <strong>had been sleeping</strong> like a log. A past activity that continued for a length of time, before another past event. So we use a range of tenses to build up a story about past events. Let’s demonstrate this now. Catherine, tell me something that happened to you today …</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></span>Ok, Finn. Well, funnily enough, while I was walking to work this morning, I saw a monkey in a tree.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></span>You never did.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>I did.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>I don’t believe you.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>It’s true.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>OK. Catherine combined the past continuous <strong>I was walking</strong> with the past simple <strong>I saw.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>That’s right, and I did that to show that one action happened whilst another one was still happening.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></span>For interrupted activities, in other words. So, Catherine, what happened next?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></span>Well, a man told me that the monkey had chased a cat up a tree.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>Really?</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>Right. So that’s past perfect to say what happened earlier in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>But did it really happen, Catherine? I’m not sure about this.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>No. But let's go with it.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></span>Yes. OK. So Catherine, what was a monkey doing in a busy London street?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></span>Well … a film crew had been making an advert when the monkey spotted a cat and chased it up the tree.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></span>I really don’t believe this, but there were two more examples of the past simple <strong>spotted</strong> and <strong>chased</strong> with the past perfect continuous <strong>had been making</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>IDENT&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></span></strong>You’re listening to BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></span>We’re talking about narrative tenses.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Time for a quiz. Fill the gaps in this short story. Number 1. Inspector Jones was called to a robbery. But by the time he arrived, the thief… a) went or b) had gone.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>It’s b) had gone.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>That’s right. Number two. While he [sfx ding] in the garden, Inspector Jones noticed an &nbsp;open window and two sets of tiny footprints. Is it a) was looking b) had looked?</p>
<p><strong>Finn&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>It’s a) was looking.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>That’s right. Number three. When Inspector Jones looked up, he [sfx ding] who had stolen the ring. Is it a) was seeing or b) saw?</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>And this one is b) saw. And I think I know who the thieves were – it must be that cat and monkey who have got into this story now!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></span>Really! Well done, Finn Sherlock. And well done to you if you got those right. And check out our website at bbclearningenglish.com for more information about on tenses. Join us again for more 6 Minute Grammar.</p>

"<div class=""text"" dir=""ltr"">
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Callum.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And me, <strong>Catherine</strong>. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>I was just admiring your hat Catherine.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Oh, do you like it?</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Well, it's interesting, <strong>really</strong> interesting. It's <strong>quite</strong> <strong>brightly</strong> coloured, isn't it? And <strong>very</strong> shiny.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thank you, I think.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Anyway, moving on. In today's programme we're going to be looking at adverbs and we'll focus on how they are used with adjectives, other adverbs and also look at a couple of categories of adverbs and their usual positions. Catherine, could you remind us what adverbs do and why they are important?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Certainly Callum. Adverbs give us more information about <strong>verbs</strong>, <strong>adjectives</strong> and other <strong>adverbs</strong>. And they're important because they help us to answer questions such as where? When? How? And how often? And adverbs can add colour and depth to what we say and write. For example, listen to this sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>He picked up his coat and left. He picked up his coat and left.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now, this is a perfectly good sentence, it's clear and grammatically correct. It tells us what happened but it's not very descriptive. Now listen again, only this time we're going to add some adverbs.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>He <strong>calmly</strong> picked up his coat and left <strong>without making a sound</strong>. He <strong>calmly</strong> picked up his coat and left <strong>without making a sound</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK, so the adverb <strong>calmly </strong>is very descriptive. It tells us how the person did the action. And there's an adverbial phrase as well, did you spot it? Listen again.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>He <strong>calmly</strong> picked up his coat and left <strong>without making a sound</strong>. He <strong>calmly</strong> picked up his coat and<strong> left without making a sound</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>So, did you spot the adverbial phrase?</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>It was 'without making a sound'.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly. So these adverbs give us lots of information which, depending on the context, can be very dramatic and atmospheric.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT<br></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>This is 6 Minute Grammar and today we're taking a look at the position of adverbs. Catherine, I want to take you back to your hat.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Really, must you?</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>I'm afraid I must, but it's all in the cause of education.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br>OK then.</p>
<p><strong>Callum</strong><br>Can you remember how I described it?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK. If I remember rightly you said my hat was <strong>really</strong> interesting, <strong>quite</strong> <strong>brightly</strong> coloured and <strong>very</strong> shiny. Aah, Callum, I see what you've done there. You've given examples of adverbs being used with adjectives and adverbs.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>You see, I'm not just a pretty face.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Mmm. Anyway, when we use adverbs to describe adjectives or other adverbs, they must go <strong>before</strong> the adjective or adverb being modified. So, <strong>interesting</strong> is an adjective, and the adverb you used was <strong>really</strong>. The adverb goes before the adjective so the correct form is <strong>really interesting</strong>. And it's the same with the adjective<strong> shiny</strong>. You used the adverb <strong>very</strong>. So <strong>very shiny </strong>is correct.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>And we also had an example of using an adverb to add information to another adverb, didn't we?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>We did Callum. You said my hat was <strong>very</strong> <strong>brightly</strong> coloured. Again the modifying adverb, in this case, <strong>very</strong>, must go before the adverb being described.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT<br></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>I think we've got a little time to look at some different categories of adverbs.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>We have, so let's start with adverbs like <strong>always</strong>,<strong> never</strong>, <strong>often</strong>, <strong>regularly </strong>and<strong> hardly ever</strong>. We call these adverbs of indefinite frequency and these are <strong>frequently</strong> used – oh, there's another one, <strong>frequently</strong>– these are frequently used before the main verb. There are two in this example, <strong>never </strong>and <strong>always</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>I have <strong>never</strong> met anyone like you. I think I will <strong>always</strong> love you.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now let's compare adverbs of indefinite frequency to adverbs of definite frequency, like <strong>this week</strong>, <strong>this year</strong>, <strong>daily</strong>. Listen out for the position of <strong>daily </strong>in this example.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>I ride my bike <strong>daily</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>So, these adverbs usually go in the third position, after the verb and object clause and not directly before the main verb.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Thanks Catherine. Now time for a short quiz to check some of today's points.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>We're going to give some example sentences. What are the adverbs and are they in the correct place? Here's the first one.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>He plays tennis well very.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>The adverbs there are <strong>well </strong>and <strong>very</strong>. But the adverb <strong>very </strong>is in the wrong place. It should go before <strong>well</strong>. The correct sentence is: He plays tennis <strong>very well</strong>. Next example, please.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>It was a dark blue car that nearly hit me.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>The adverb there is <strong>dark</strong> and it was in the correct place. Final sentence, please.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>I every day take the train to work.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the adverb there, <strong>every day</strong>, is not in the correct place. It needs to go after the verb clause. So: I take the train to work <strong>every day</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>You can find more about adverbs on our website <a href=""http://www.bbclearningenglish.com"">bbclearningenglish.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And please join us again for more 6 Minute Grammar.</p>
<p><strong>Both<br></strong>Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>One more question Catherine. Just why are you wearing a fluorescent purple cycle helmet in the studio?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's a very good question...</p>

"<div class=""text"" dir=""ltr"">
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br></strong></span><span>Hello, and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Catherine.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>And me, Finn. Hello.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And today we're talking about six different ways of talking about the future – like <strong>will </strong>and <strong>be going to</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong></span><span>We can also use the <strong>present simple</strong> and <strong>continuous</strong> tenses, and we're going to share a couple of other ways as well…</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br></strong></span><span>That’s right and as usual, there'll be a quiz at the end to test what you've learned. So let's get started. First, we’ll look at <strong>will</strong> and <strong>be going to</strong>. They're both very common, and a lot of the time they're used in a similar way, to talk about predictions. But not always. So – let's hear an example of <strong>be going to</strong> – Finn, a question for you: what's for dinner tonight?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Hmmm… <strong>I'm</strong> <strong>going to cook</strong> my favourite meal. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>I know what that is...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>That’s curry! I've got all the ingredients already. And you, Catherine? What about you?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br></strong></span><span>Well, I haven't made any plans – <strong>I'll</strong> probably just have something simple… like tomato soup.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong></span><span>Ooh, sounds yummy.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br><span>Yeah. So - Finn <strong>is</strong> <strong>going to</strong> cook curry. He already knew his plan at the time of speaking. It’s his intention – or his plan – to cook curry. And we often use <strong>be going to</strong> in this way.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong>And Catherine – what did you say about tomato soup, again?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>I said… <strong>I'll </strong>probably have something simple… like tomato soup.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Yes, so Catherine used <strong>I’ll</strong> or <strong>will -</strong>&nbsp;<strong>I will </strong>– but she made her decision at the time of speaking – so this is one of the main differences between <strong>will</strong> and <strong>going to</strong>. Ok, so we have four more ways of talking about the future to look at….</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br><span>We do and we have to talk some more about your curry, Finn, at this point.&nbsp;So <strong>are you eating </strong>alone?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>No, <strong>I'm eating </strong>with a couple of friends.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br><span>Aha! Now this time my question and Finn's answer are both in the <strong>present continuous</strong> – but we’re using the present continuous to talk about the future. We use the present continuous for arrangements like this – so Finn has arranged to eat with friends.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br><span>Yes.<strong> I'm eating</strong> with friends. And you know, we could also use <strong>be going to</strong> for this as well, but not <strong>will.</strong> So I could say: <strong>I'm going to</strong> <strong>eat</strong> with a couple of friends.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>So that’s three ways, and now there’s another present tense we can use to talk about the future and that’s the <strong>present simple</strong>. So curry time again, Finn. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Let’s talk about curry!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>When are your friends coming to dinner?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Well, my friends are passing through London on a very tight schedule. So <strong>they arrive</strong> at the station at 5pm, <strong>we eat</strong> dinner at 6pm, and <strong>they leave</strong> on a plane at 9pm the same night!</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br></strong>How exciting! And that conveniently demonstrates why we use the present simple for future events – we use it to talk about timetables. <strong>Your friends arrive</strong> at the station at 5pm, </span><span><strong>we eat</strong> dinner at 6pm, and <strong>they leave </strong>on a plane at 9pm the same night. And these are all things that are planned to happen at specific times.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br><span>Right. Now Catherine, it's your turn to use our next form – <strong>be about to</strong> – to talk about your dinner plans, OK?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Yes. <strong>I'm</strong> <strong>about to</strong> say something about tomato soup.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>OK, you’re about to. OK, very good, very clever.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes. So we use <strong>be about to</strong>, for things in the very near future. And <strong>be about to</strong> is followed by the base form of a verb. So the film <strong>is about to start.</strong> Or the train <strong>is about to leave,</strong> things like that.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br><span>Great! So we’ve now looked at five ways of talking about the future. What about the sixth?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br><span>Well, the sixth way isn't actually a tense, it’s not even a phrase – it's just a group of normal everyday verbs. And now it’s time to bring in Callum who’s been waiting patiently. Listen carefully for the verbs that Callum uses to talk about the future. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Callum<br></span></strong><span>I <strong>plan</strong> <strong>to do</strong> evening classes in coding.</span></p>
<p><span>I <strong>aim</strong> <strong>to finish</strong> all the preparation by 8pm.</span></p>
<p><span>Wang Chun <strong>intends to move</strong> to Berlin.</span></p>
<p><span>We've <strong>arranged</strong> <strong>to meet</strong> in person next spring.</span></p>
<p><span>She <strong>decided</strong> <strong>to take</strong> the money.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br><span>Good. So we heard <strong>plan</strong>, <strong>aim</strong>, <strong>intend</strong>, <strong>arrange</strong> and <strong>decide</strong>. In fact, lots of verbs can be used like this – followed by <strong>to</strong> and <strong>the base form of a verb</strong> – to talk about the future. So listen out for them! Oh, and thank you Callum.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Callum</span></strong><br><span>You're welcome.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>IDENT<br></span></strong><span>6 Minute Grammar, from BBC Learning English.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br></strong></span><span>And now, it's quiz time! Question one. If you've already made a plan to visit France, which is better? a) I will travel to France this year or b) I'm going to travel to France this year?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong></span><span>The answer is b) I'm going to travel to France this year. Number two. Which is correct? a) We're about to get married next summer or b) We plan to get married next summer.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Catherine<br></strong></span><span>And the correct answer is b) We plan to get married next summer. </span></p>

"<div class=""text"" dir=""ltr"">
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Callum.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>And me, Catherine. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>Callum</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>In this programme, we’re talking about relative clauses.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;<br></strong>Yes, relative clauses add information about the person or thing that you’re talking about. There are two kinds of relative clauses: defining and non-defining.</p>
<p><strong>Callum</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Let’s begin with defining relative clauses. Here’s Finn with an example:</p>
<p><strong>Finn &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>The man <strong>whose phone I found</strong> gave me a reward.</p>
<p><strong>Callum</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Thanks Finn. The clause <strong>whose phone I found</strong> is a defining relative clause because it identifies which man Finn is talking about. If I ask the question ‘which man’ – the relative clause answers it: the man <strong>whose phone I found</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>That's right. And relative clauses usually start with a relative pronoun. We use <strong>who</strong> for people, <strong>which </strong>for things, <strong>that</strong> for both people and things and <strong>whose </strong>where a possessive is needed. Let’s hear another defining relative clause:</p>
<p><strong>Finn &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>I’ve lost the t-shirt <strong>that my mother gave me</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Callum &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>How careless of you Finn! Here, the relative clause <strong>that my mother gave me</strong> tells us which t-shirt Finn is talking about.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br>I’ve lost the t-shirt that my mother gave me.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Let’s move on to non-defining relative clauses. Here’s an example:</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>David’s mother, <strong>who was born in Mexico</strong>, is my sister’s Spanish teacher.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>OK. The phrase <strong>who was born in Mexico</strong> is a non-defining relative clause. It doesn't answer the question ‘which mother?’ because David only has one mother! Instead, the relative clause gives us extra information about David’s mother: she was born in Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>Callum &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>In fact, if we leave the relative clause out entirely, the sentence still makes sense:</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>David’s mother is my sister’s Spanish teacher.</p>
<p><strong>Callum &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Now let’s look again at relative pronouns. We can use them to refer to the subject or object of a clause. Finn, who is Daniel Radcliffe?</p>
<p><strong>Finn &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Daniel Radcliffe is the actor <strong>who</strong> plays Harry Potter.</p>
<p><strong>Callum</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>In this sentence, the relative pronoun <strong>who</strong> refers to the subject – Daniel Radcliffe. Daniel Radcliffe plays Harry Potter.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And another question for you Finn. Which sport do you enjoy the most?</p>
<p><strong>Finn &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Well, football is the sport <strong>that</strong> I enjoy the most, Catherine.</p>
<p><strong>Callum</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>This time, the pronoun <strong>that</strong> refers to the object. And you can usually leave out object pronouns, like this:</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>Football is the sport I enjoy the most.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>You’re listening to bbclearningenglish.com.</p>
<p><strong>Callum</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>For non-defining clauses, you can’t leave out the pronoun. Also, non-defining relative clauses can't begin with the word <strong>that</strong>. Use <strong>which</strong> instead, like this:</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>Last year I went to Paris, <strong>which</strong> is the capital of France.</p>
<p><strong>Callum &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>The clause <strong>which is the capital of France</strong> – is giving us extra information. We can leave it out and still understand the sentence:</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>Last year I went to Paris.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And now it's time for a quiz. Join these sentences together using a defining or non-defining relative clause. Number one. The bus was very late. I took it this morning. The bus was very late. I took it this morning.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>The bus <strong>that</strong> I took this morning was very late. Or you could also say: The bus I took this morning was very late.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>You can, very good. Number two: My car needs repairing. I only bought it last month. My car needs repairing. I only bought it last month.</p>
<p><strong>Callum &nbsp;<br></strong>My car, <strong>which</strong> I only bought last month, needs repairing. <strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>And that was a non-defining relative clause. Number three. David Beckham has over 20 tattoos. He used to play for Manchester United. David Beckham has over 20 tattoos. He used to play for Manchester United.</p>
<p><strong>Callum &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>David Beckham, <strong>who</strong> used to play for Manchester United, has over 20 tattoos.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right. And we could also say: David Beckham, <strong>who</strong> has over 20 tattoos, used to play for Manchester United.</p>
<p><strong>Callum</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>And that’s the end of the quiz. Well done you got them all right. Now for a little tip. In written English, we put commas around non-defining relative clauses. In spoken English, we leave a small pause for each comma. Listen to this example:</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>My sister, who works in Nairobi, is a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>The pauses tell us that this is a non-defining relative clause, which means Finn has only one sister, so he doesn’t need to define her.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>My uncle who works in Athens is a dentist.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>And this time, there’s no pause, which means it’s a defining relative clause. Finn is defining&nbsp;which uncle he is talking about, so he probably has more than one uncle.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Callum &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Thanks Finn. So that’s defining and non-defining relative clauses. They start with a relative pronoun and give additional information about the person or thing that you’re talking about.</p>

"<div class=""text"" dir=""ltr""><h3>The definite article with abstract uncountable nouns</h3>
<p>Join Callum, Catherine and Finn as they talk through this topic. If you've completed&nbsp;Activity 1 and Activity 2&nbsp;you should now be quite familiar with the topic. See if you can get all the answers in the quiz correct!</p>
</div><br /><div class=""text"" dir=""ltr"">
<p><strong>Callum</strong><strong>&nbsp; </strong><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar, I'm Callum.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>And I'm Catherine, hello.</p>
<p><strong>Callum</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>In this programme we're talking about the definite article with abstract uncountable nouns.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, we'll explain what that all means.</p>
<p><strong>Callum &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>And we'll end up with a quiz to see if we've done a good job.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>No pressure then!</p>
<p><strong>Callum &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Indeed. To start with, let's just remind everyone about the terms we're using. First, there's the definite article. What's that, Catherine?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong><strong>The</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Callum &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>The what?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Just <strong>the</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Just the what?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>You're doing this on purpose, aren't you Callum? The definite article is the word <strong>the</strong>. Articles are used before nouns.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Today's topic is using <strong>the</strong> with abstract uncountable nouns. Tell us about those.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK. Now, before I get to the abstract part, let's just remind everybody about uncountable nouns, which you might also hear described as mass nouns. These are nouns that, as the name suggests, you can't count. They have no plural form. Words like air, water, cheese, money...</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Wait a minute...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br>Yes?</p>
<p><strong>Callum</strong><br>Did you say money?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Did you say you can't count money?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right. You can't count money, at least not grammatically. You can't count money in the same way as you can count, for example, chairs. Because, when you count chairs, you can just give a number. How many chairs are there? Three, ten, 2,150. But if I ask you Callum how much money you have in your pocket, what would you say?</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>OK, well, let me see. I've got five, ten... I've got £15. So I can count money, surely?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, you've got <strong>15 pounds</strong>. But you haven't got <strong>15 moneys</strong>. So, pounds are countable, money isn't. We are counting the pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>I see, and what are abstract uncountable nouns then?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, before we go to abstract, let's first talk about the concrete ones. Concrete uncountable nouns are things that you can physically experience, that's things that you can touch, see, hear, smell or taste. But abstract nouns don't refer to these physical things. Abstract nouns refer to ideas, feelings, emotions, qualities and concepts. So, things like: <strong>love</strong>, <strong>fun</strong>, <strong>happiness</strong>, <strong>bravery</strong>, <strong>patience</strong>, <strong>enthusiasm</strong> and <strong>childhood.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>But I'm sure I experienced <strong>childhood</strong>. It seemed pretty real to me.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, because we describe something as abstract, it doesn't mean it isn't real. You certainly were a child Callum at some time, whenever that was. But the period of time when you were a child... all the experiences that you had when you were growing up... aren't physical things. Together they make an idea or a concept that we call <strong>childhood</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT<br></strong>6 Minute Grammar from BBC Learning English</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Today we're looking at using the definite article with abstract uncountable nouns. We've defined our terms, so now let's look at how these two go together. Catherine, can we use <strong>the </strong>with abstract uncountable nouns?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, Callum, it depends on the context. If we are talking about something in general, we don't use the definite article. Here's Finn, with an example.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>It can be difficult to find <strong>happiness.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>The abstract noun there is <strong>happiness</strong>. Here we're talking about <strong>happiness</strong> in general, we don't use the definite article. Now compare that use of <strong>happiness</strong>, with this one.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>I can't express <strong>the happiness</strong> that I felt when my son was born.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now in this case, are we talking about <strong>happiness</strong> in general?</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>No, we're talking about a specific time, a particular moment when there was <strong>happiness</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right, so in this case, because it is referring to a particular time we do need to use <strong>the definite article</strong>. Note that after the noun <strong>the happiness </strong>there is a phrase that points to the exact time being described. And in this case the phrase is:</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>That I felt when my son was born.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly. And that phrase is a defining relative clause. When there is a defining relative clause following an abstract uncountable noun, the chances are the noun will have the definite article in front of it.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>So we know that the definite article <strong>the </strong>is used with abstract uncountable nouns when we are talking about a specific example of that noun.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And when we are talking about that noun in general, we don't use any article.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>I think it's time for a little quiz. Listen to each sentence and decide if the use of the article is correct or not. Finn, number one please.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>I've got a lot of the ambition.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And that one is... not correct. <strong>Ambition</strong> is the noun but it shouldn't have the definite article. Next one please, Finn.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>He had the confidence that is needed to sing in public.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>That is correct. The noun is <strong>confidence</strong> and as the particular example of confidence is defined, we do need <strong>the</strong>. Last question, please.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Love is all you need.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Of course, that one is correct. <strong>Love</strong> is the noun and it refers to the idea of love in general so no definite article. Well done if you got all those right.</p>

</div><br /><li><h3>Concrete nouns</h3>
<p>These are nouns for things that we can taste, touch, see, hear or smell.</p>
<p><strong>Furniture, accommodation, cheese, air, music</strong></p>
<h3>Abstract nouns</h3>
<p>Nouns for things we can't taste, touch, see, hear or smell. These are things like&nbsp;<strong>ideas</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>emotions</strong>,<strong>feelings, qualities&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>concepts</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Love, hate, friendship, courage, anger, childhood</strong></p>
<h3>The definite article</h3>
<p>Use&nbsp;<strong>the definite article</strong>&nbsp;with abstract uncountable nouns when the noun is used to refer to specific example of that noun.</p>
<p><em>He had&nbsp;<strong>the courage</strong>&nbsp;to go back into the burning building to rescue the puppy =&nbsp;</em>A specific example of courage.</p>
<p><em>During my time in the fire service I saw many acts of&nbsp;<strong>courage</strong>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</em>Does not refer to a specific act of courage. No definite article needed.</p>

"<div class=""text"" dir=""ltr""><h3>Adverb position 1</h3>
<p>Callum and Catherine, with Finn's help, talk about the three positions where adverbs usually go when used with verbs. They also explain where to put adverbs when used with modals, questions and negatives.</p>
</div><br /><div class=""text"" dir=""ltr"">
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, <strong>Callum</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And me, <strong>Catherine</strong>. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>Callum</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>In this programme we’re talking about adverbs and where they should go. Catherine, remind us what adverbs are.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>Certainly Callum. Adverbs are words or phrases that we use to give more information about verbs, adjectives or other adverbs. We use them to express how someone does something or how something happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>In today’s programme we’re going to focus on how they are used with verbs. Listen out for the adverbs <strong>usually</strong>, <strong>really</strong>, <strong>hardly</strong> and <strong>ever</strong>. Here’s Finn.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>I <strong>usually</strong> drive to work. I <strong>usually</strong> drive to work.<br>I don’t <strong>really</strong> like cheese. I don’t <strong>really</strong> like cheese.<br>I can <strong>hardly</strong> believe what happened at the concert. I can <strong>hardly</strong> believe what happened at the concert.<br>Have you <strong>ever</strong> been to Scotland? Have you <strong>ever</strong> been to Scotland?</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Now, let’s look more closely at where to put the adverb.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Adverbs can usually be placed in one of three positions.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>The first position is at the very beginning of the sentence, before the subject.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong><strong>Usually</strong> I drive to work.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>The second position is before the main verb.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>I <strong>usually</strong> drive to work.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>And the third position is after the direct object or complement of the verb.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>I drive to work <strong>usually</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>You’re listening to BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Today we’re talking about where to put adverbs when we are using them to give more information about verbs.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>We’ve seen that there are three positions where adverbs typically go.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>So is it the case that you can put any adverb in any of these positions?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Callum, if it was that simple, it would be fantastic. Many adverbs can indeed go in any of these positions, depending on style and context.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>I feel there is a 'but’ coming.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>But…</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Ah, there it is…</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>But that’s not always the case. Some adverbs can’t go in certain places and some are more common in particular positions than others.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>And we also have to consider modals and other auxiliaries, questions and negatives.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>We do. So let’s start with the verb <strong>to be</strong><em>. </em>When the verb <strong>to be </strong>is the main verb of a sentence, we usually put adverbs immediately after the verb.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>He’s <strong>always</strong> on time.<br>I was <strong>never</strong> happy at school.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>When there is more than one part to the verb, where does the adverb go?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>If there is an auxiliary such as have or has in the present perfect or a modal like can, will, should and so on, the adverb usually goes after the auxiliary and before the main verb.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>You can <strong>never</strong> predict what mood he is going to be in.<br>I’ve <strong>rarely</strong> seen him angry.<br>I will <strong>always</strong> love you.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And I'll always love you Finn. The same is true in negative sentences. The adverb will come after the negative and before the main verb.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>I’ve <strong>never</strong> visited Iceland. I’ve <strong>never</strong> visited Iceland.<br>He can’t <strong>even</strong> make a cup of tea. He can’t <strong>even</strong> make a cup of tea.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>What about questions?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>The same is true there. The adverb comes after the question word or auxiliary and before the main verb.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Do you <strong>still</strong> live in the same city? Do you <strong>still</strong> live in the same city?<br>Would you <strong>really</strong> like me to come and stay? Would you <strong>really</strong> like me to come and stay?<br>Have you <strong>ever</strong> thought about emigrating? Have you <strong>ever</strong> thought about emigrating?</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Now, are there any places where you can't put an adverb?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>There are. Adverbs don’t go between a main verb and its direct object. So for example could I say: I play very well tennis?</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Well you could say it, but it wouldn’t be right.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK then, how about this? I play tennis very well.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>That’s correct, though only grammatically.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Well actually you play tennis awfully!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's true actually Callum, yep.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>We’re nearly at the end of today’s programme, just time to take our quick quiz on this topic.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>You’re going to hear some sentences and you need to decide if the adverbs are in the correct place. Here’s the first one</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>You always must remember to lock the door when you leave. You always must remember to lock the door when you leave.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>This one is…. not right. The adverb <strong><em>always</em></strong> should come after the modal ‘must’ and before the main verb ‘remember’. Here’s the next one.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>I have never learned a foreign language. I have never learned a foreign language.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>This is… correct. The adverb, in this case <strong>never</strong> comes between the auxiliary ‘have’ and the main verb ‘learned’.&nbsp; And the final sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>She rarely is late.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>This is… not correct. The adverb <strong>rarely&nbsp;</strong>should come after the verb ‘to be’.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>So that’s our introduction to the position of adverbs.</p>
<p><strong>Callum<br></strong>Do check our website bbclearningenglish.com for more information on this subject.</p>

<p><strong>Both<br></strong>Goodbye</p>
</div><br /><li><h3>Adverb position with verbs</h3>
<p>There are many different kinds of adverbs and many different rules for where they can and can't go. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally there are&nbsp;<strong>three positions</strong>&nbsp;where we put adverbs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Before the subject<br><em><strong>Slowly</strong>&nbsp;he opened the door.</em><br><br></li>
<li>Before the main verb<br><em>He&nbsp;<strong>slowly</strong>&nbsp;opened the door.</em><br><br></li>
<li>After the verb and its direct object or clause<br><em>He opened the door&nbsp;<strong>slowly</strong>.&nbsp;</em></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Where we don't put adverbs</strong><em><br></em></p>
<p>Adverbs don't go between a verb and its direct object.</p>
<p><em>I play tennis<strong>&nbsp;very well.</strong></em>&nbsp;Correct<br><em>I play&nbsp;<strong>very well</strong>&nbsp;tennis</em>. Not correct</p>
<p>Also we don't put adverbs between a verb and a following&nbsp;<strong>gerund</strong>&nbsp;or a verb follwed by an&nbsp;<strong>infinitive with to</strong>.</p>
<p><em>He started running&nbsp;<strong>quickly</strong>&nbsp;when he saw the dog chasing him.&nbsp;</em>Correct<br><em>He started&nbsp;<strong>quickly</strong>&nbsp;running when he saw the dog chasing him</em>. Not correct</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Second position adverbs</h3>
<h3>With auxiliaries</h3>
<p>Whether the auxiliary is a modal or part of the verb structure put the adverb after the auxiliary and before the main verb.</p>
<p><em>They should&nbsp;<strong>never</strong>&nbsp;have got married.</em></p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>With questions</h3>
<p>The adverb goes after the question word and before the main verb.</p>
<p class=""GrammarBank""><em>Have you&nbsp;<strong>ever</strong>&nbsp;thought of changing job?</em></p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>With negatives</h3>
<p>The adverb goes after any auxiliary/modal and the negative word and before the main verb.</p>
<p><em>I wouldn't&nbsp;<strong>seriously</strong>&nbsp;consider selling the car unless I got a great offer.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><strong>Neil</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Neil.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></span>And me, Catherine. Today, we're talking about the <strong>past perfect continuous</strong> tense…</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>… which we use to give background information to an event in the past. We'll give you lots of examples.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>We'll explain when to use the past perfect simple instead of the past perfect continuous…</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>… and of course we'll finish with a quiz.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>Let's start with an example. Here’s Finn.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>Joe and Alice got together in 2012. Joe had been living in London for two years when they met.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>So, we use the past perfect continuous to talk about something that was happening before another event or situation in the past. We can use it when we want to say how long this earlier action was happening for.</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>Now, in this case <strong>Joe</strong> <strong>had been living</strong> tells us what Joe was doing up to the time he met Alice.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>That's right. And the later action <strong>when they met</strong> was in the past simple. Let's hear that example again.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Joe and Alice got together in 2012. Joe had been living in London for two years when they met.</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>Here's another example. Which action happened first?</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>We had been trying to open the door for five minutes when I finally found the key.</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>So <strong>we had been trying</strong>, in the past perfect continuous, was the earlier action.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>Exactly. Sometimes, the action or situation that happens first in time comes second in the sentence. Listen to this:</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>Jack ran the marathon in less than three hours. He had been training for it since 2010.</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>So, the past perfect continuous phrase <strong>he had been training </strong>came in the second part of the sentence, but it happened earlier in time.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>Yes. And the event that happened later in time: <strong>Jack</strong> <strong>ran the marathon</strong>, was in the past simple and came first in the sentence.</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>Right. So, here's another sentence. Can you work out which action or happened first?</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>He missed the train, which he'd been hoping to catch.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>The earlier action was <strong>he’d been hoping</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>That's right. So, in that example the past perfect continuous was in a relative clause: <strong>which he had been hoping</strong>…</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>That's quite common with the past perfect continuous. And another common structure to use with past perfect continuous is a time conjunction, like this:</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>After I had been swimming for an hour, I was so cold I had to stop.</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>So, we had <strong>after</strong> plus <strong>I had been swimming.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>Yes, and that is the past perfect continuous in relative clauses and after time conjunctions.</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>Now, we form the past perfect continuous with <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>had been </strong>and the <strong>present participle</strong> of the main verb. Here are those examples again, Finn.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>Joe had been living…</p>
<p>We’d been trying…</p>
<p>I had been swimming…</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>For negative sentences, it's <strong>subject </strong>plus <strong>hadn't been </strong>and the present participle.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>I hadn't been waiting very long when the bus arrived.</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>And don't forget those short forms: <strong>I had</strong> becomes <strong>I'd</strong>;<strong> We had </strong>is<strong> we'd</strong>;<strong> had not </strong>is<strong> hadn't</strong> and so on.</p>
<p><strong><span>IDENT<br></span></strong>6 Minute Grammar from the BBC.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>And we're talking about the past perfect continuous.</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>We often use it to give background information about a situation or event that was happening up to another event in the past…</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>… which is usually in the past simple.</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>Sometimes we can use either the past perfect simple or the past perfect continuous, particularly for activities that continue for a long time, like <strong>work, run </strong>or <strong>sleep</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>So we can say:</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br> Patrick felt refreshed because <strong>he had slept</strong> all afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br> Or we can say:</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Patrick felt refreshed because <strong>he had been sleeping</strong> all day.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>But if the earlier action had been completed, then we use the past perfect simple.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong><strong>I'd</strong> already <strong>cooked</strong> supper when Jan got home.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>If the earlier action is incomplete, use the past perfect continuous, to focus on the process or length of time that the action continued, rather than the end result.</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>And, now it's time for our quiz. Which is correct? Number one: a) I'd only been waiting a few minutes when the bus arrived. b) I only waited a few minutes when the bus had arrived.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br> It’s a). We need the past perfect continuous for the earlier action or situation.</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>Correct. Number 2: a) After they'd been walking for three hours, they realised they were lost. b) After they walked for three hours, they'd realised they were lost.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>And it's a) again. The earlier action was the walking, so that's in the past perfect continuous.</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>Good, finally, number 3: a) Sam finally bought the car that he'd saved up for. b) Sam finally bought the car that he'd been saving up for.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>And this time, both are correct.</p>
<p><strong><span>Neil<br></span></strong>That's right. Well done if you got them all right. There's lots more about this on our website at bbclearningenglish.com. Join us again for more 6 Minute Grammar.</p>

"<div class=""text"" dir=""ltr""><h3>Comparatives and superlatives</h3>
<p>Catherine had a terrible journey to work this morning. But it’s a useful way to help us understand comparatives and superlatives. Find out why in this episode of 6 Minute Grammar.</p>
</div><br /><div class=""text"" dir=""ltr"">
<p><strong>Finn</strong><span>&nbsp;<br></span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Finn.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>And me, Catherine. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></span>Today we're talking about comparatives and superlatives. So, let's start with comparatives. We use them to compare one thing or person with another. Catherine, how was your journey to work this morning?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></span>Ok. Well, my journey to work wasn't great, actually. I woke up later than usual, so I took the bus because it's quicker than walking. And it's easier than cycling, too. But the traffic was much busier than normal and we went slower and slower and people became more and more impatient. And the slower the bus went, the more impatient the people&nbsp;became.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>You poor thing. But, lots of comparatives there in your story - we had <strong>later</strong> and <strong>quicker</strong>: Catherine woke up <strong>later</strong> than usual, and she said the bus is <strong>quicker</strong> than walking.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>I did. And to make the comparative form of short adjectives or adverbs, we just add the letters <strong>-</strong><strong>e-r</strong>. So, <strong>quick</strong>, <strong>quicker</strong>. But if the word already ends in <strong>-e</strong>, we just add the letter <strong>-r</strong>. <strong>Late</strong>, <strong>later</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>Remember that we often use the word <strong>than</strong> in comparative sentences, but sometimes we can leave it out, for example in the question <strong>Which is quicker – the bus or the train?</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>I also said that the bus is <strong>easier than cycling</strong> and <strong>the traffic was much busier than normal</strong>. For adjectives and adverbs that end in the letter <strong>-y</strong> and the sound <strong>ee</strong>, make comparatives by losing the letter <strong>-y</strong> and adding the letters <strong>-i-e-r</strong>. So the comparative of <strong>easy </strong>is <strong>easier</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>And <strong>busy</strong> becomes <strong>busier</strong>. In fact, Catherine said the traffic was <strong>much</strong> busier. Now, we can use <strong>much</strong> or <strong>a lot</strong> before an adjective or adverb to emphasise the difference. <strong>Much busier; a lot easier</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>To make comparative forms of most adjectives and adverbs with two or more syllables, we use <strong>more</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>For example,<strong> impatient</strong> has three syllables: <strong>im-pa-tient</strong>, so the comparative of <strong>impatient</strong> is <strong>more impatient</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>That’s right and to emphasise how something changes, we can repeat comparatives, or the word <strong>more</strong> with <strong>and</strong> in the middle, like this:</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br>The bus went<strong> slower and slower </strong>and people became<strong> more and more impatient</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>Don't remind me. Here’s another way to use comparatives. Listen to this sentence: <strong>the slower the bus went, the more impatient the people became</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>I'm not surprised. Here Catherine used two different comparatives - <strong>slower</strong> and <strong>more impatient</strong> - with <strong>the</strong>, to say how one thing changes when something else changes. <strong>The slower the bus went</strong>, <strong>the more impatient the people became</strong>. Really not a good morning, was it, Catherine?</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>Not at all. And it got <strong>worse</strong> when the bus broke down!&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>Oh really? Oh no, but perfect for us because<strong> worse</strong> is the comparative adjective of bad. It is irregular. The comparative adverb is <strong>badly</strong>. Catherine’s morning went <strong>badly</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>Very badly. And the comparative of both <strong>good</strong> and <strong>well</strong> is also irregular: it's <strong>better</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>IDENT<br></span></strong>6 Minute Grammar from the BBC.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>And we're talking about comparatives and superlatives.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>Let's look at superlative adjectives and adverbs. They help us compare one person or thing with <strong>several</strong> others. So Catherine, what is <strong>the quickest</strong> way for you to get to work?</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>Well, usually the bus is <strong>the quickest</strong>, but not today. But walking is <strong>the most reliable</strong> way and it’s also <strong>the easiest</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>OK, we make superlatives in a similar way to comparatives…</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>… but the ending for short words is <strong>-e-s-t</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>So <strong>quick</strong> becomes <strong>the</strong> <strong>quickest</strong>…</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>… and we use <strong>most</strong> for words with two or more syllables.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>So the superlative of <strong>reliable</strong> is <strong>the</strong> <strong>most reliable</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>That's right. For two-syllable words ending in the letter&nbsp;<strong>-y,</strong> change the <strong>y</strong> to<strong> i</strong> and add <strong>-e-s-t</strong>, so <strong>easy</strong> becomes <strong>the easiest</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>Don't forget to put <strong>the</strong> before a superlative adjective or adverb, so it's: walking is <strong>the best</strong> way to get to work…</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>… though we can use possessive adjectives instead of the word <strong>the</strong>, like this:</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong><strong>My best</strong> friend is getting married today.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>And did you spot the irregular superlative - <strong>best</strong>? This is the superlative form of <strong>good </strong>and<strong> well</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>… and the irregular superlative of <strong>bad</strong> is <strong>worst</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>Now for the quiz. Which is correct? a) Your internet connection is faster than mine or b) Your internet connection is fastest than mine.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>It's a).</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>Good. And the last one, a) I hope I have a better journey home tonight or b) I hope I have a best journey home tonight.</p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong>Well, it’s a). And we do hope you have a much better journey home tonight, Catherine.</p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong>Thank you.</p>

</div><br /><h3>Making comparatives</h3>
<p>One syllable adjectives and adverbs add&nbsp;<strong>-er&nbsp;</strong>for comparative and&nbsp;<strong>-est</strong>&nbsp;for superlative.<br><em><br>cheap - cheaper - cheapest<br>great - greater - greatest<br>fast - faster - fastest</em></p>
<p>If the adjective or adverb ends in&nbsp;<strong>-e</strong>, then just add&nbsp;<strong>-r</strong>&nbsp;(comparative) or&nbsp;<strong>-st&nbsp;</strong>(superlative).</p>
<p><em>nice - nicer - nicest<br>safe - safer - safest<br>rude - ruder - rudest</em></p>
<p>If the adjective ends in a&nbsp;<strong>vowel + consonant</strong>, double the last letter before adding&nbsp;<strong>-er/-est</strong>&nbsp;unless it ends in<strong>-w</strong>.</p>
<p><em>big - bigger - biggest<br>hot - hotter - hottest<br>new - newer - newest</em></p>
<p>For adjectives/adverbs with&nbsp;<strong>three or more syllables</strong>, use&nbsp;<strong>more</strong>&nbsp;in the comparative and&nbsp;<strong>most</strong>&nbsp;in the superlative.</p>
<p><em>expensive - more expensive - most expensive</em><br><em>fluently - more fluently - most fluently</em></p>
<p>For many adjectives/adverbs with two syllables the comparative and superlative can be formed either by adding&nbsp;<strong>-er/-est</strong>&nbsp;or by using&nbsp;<strong>more/most</strong>.</p>
<p><em>quiet - quieter/more quiet - quietest/most quiet<br>common - commoner/more common - commonest/most common</em></p>
<p>For&nbsp;<strong>two syllable</strong>&nbsp;adjectives/adverbs that&nbsp;<strong>end in -y</strong>: change the&nbsp;<strong>y</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>i</strong>&nbsp;before adding&nbsp;<strong>-er/-est</strong>.</p>
<p><em>happy - happier - happiest<br>busy - busier - busiest</em><br><em>early - earlier - earliest</em></p>

"<div class=""text"" dir=""ltr""><h3>Linking devices: cause and effect</h3>
<p>Neil&nbsp;prefers paper books to e-books. Find out why and learn some useful phrases for talking about cause and effect in this episode of 6 Minute Grammar.</p>
</div><br /><div class=""text"" dir=""ltr"">
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Hello! Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And me, Catherine. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>In this show we're talking about linking devices.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, linking devices.&nbsp;There are lots of different kinds, but today we're interested in words and phrases that link a <strong>cause</strong> – that's something that happens - with its <strong>effect</strong> <strong>or result.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>So words and phrases like <strong>therefore, for that reason</strong> and <strong>because of. </strong>We'll tell you how they work…</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>…We'll give you lots of examples…</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>…And we'll finish off with a quiz to check what you've learnt.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>So here we go. Let's start with an example. So Neil, do you prefer e-books or paper books?</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, I have to say, I'm a bit old fashioned: I like a good paper book.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br>Why's that then?</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>It just&nbsp;feels&nbsp;more authentic.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK, well, we're going to talk today, actually, about e-books, so can you give&nbsp;us an example sentence about e-books. Come on then Neil...</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>E-books are increasingly popular. There has been a fall in sales of paper books<em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Except to you&nbsp;Neil. Now those two sentences are OK. But we could make them a lot clearer and more interesting by linking the ideas in them together with a word like <strong>consequently</strong>, like this.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>E-books are increasingly popular. <strong>Consequently,</strong> there has been a fall in sales of paper books.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>Consequently</strong> is a very useful linking word. It shows that the event before the word <strong>consequently</strong> is the cause of the event after it. We could also use the words <strong>therefore, as a result, for that reason, thus</strong> or <strong>that's why.</strong> They all mean the same as <strong>consequently</strong>. And they are all used to join the ideas in two sentences or main clauses together.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Although remember that some are more formal than others. We use <strong>that's why</strong> a lot in informal everyday English.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>I missed the bus <strong>and that's why</strong> I'm late.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Good example Catherine: it would sound wrong to say <strong>I missed the bus</strong> <strong>and therefore I'm late</strong>. Now can you give us an example of a more formal use of linking devices?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK, try this one: There was a lot of opposition to the proposal; <strong>therefore,</strong> it was dropped.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Nice one. You can use <strong>consequently</strong> and <strong>thus</strong> instead of <strong>therefore</strong> in this type of sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right. Now let's look at a group of words and phrases that we use to link cause and effect in a slightly different way.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Some examples are: <strong>because of, as a result of, due to</strong> and <strong>owing to</strong>. Listen.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>Due to</strong> the increasing popularity of e-books, there has been a fall in sales of paper books.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>So how is that different? Well, <strong>due to</strong> is followed by a noun phrase – <strong>the increasing&nbsp;</strong><strong>popularity of e-books</strong> – not a complete sentence or main clause. We could also say <strong>due&nbsp;</strong><strong>to e-books increasing in popularity. </strong>That's a participle clause.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>So <strong>due to</strong> joins a noun phrase or a participle clause to the main clause in the sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Exactly. And <strong>as a result of, owing to</strong> or <strong>because of </strong>do too. We could use any of these in that example because they mean the same as <strong>due to</strong>. But <strong>because of</strong> is less formal than the others.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right, and we could also put the sentence the other way round, like this&nbsp;Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>There has been a fall in sales of paper books <strong>due to</strong> the increasing popularity of e-books.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, it just depends which part of the sentence you want to emphasize by putting first.</p>
<p><strong>IDENT<br></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And we're looking at linking devices of cause and effect.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Now for a couple of tips. When you start a sentence, in writing, with a noun phrase, be sure to use a comma after it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>So <strong>As a result of</strong> <strong>the fall in paper book sales,</strong> (comma) some bookshops are struggling to stay open.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>That's right. But don't use a comma if the noun phrase comes at the end.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And if we're using a verb phrase, we can introduce it with the phrase <strong>the fact that.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes. You could say <strong>As a result of</strong> <strong>the fact that book sales have fallen,</strong> some bookshops are struggling to stay open.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>And now it's quiz time! Complete these sentences. Number 1. Our climate is changing a) due to the Arctic ice is melting. b) therefore the Arctic ice is melting.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>The answer's b) therefore the Arctic ice is melting.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well done! Number 2. Lewis was promoted a) for that reason his hard work. b) as a result of his hard work.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>It's b) as a result of his hard work.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Very good! Number 3. The accident happened a) owing to the fog on the motorway. b) owing to the fog was on the motorway.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>This time it's a) owing to the fog on the motorway.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Well done indeed! I hope wherever you are, you listened carefully to the show and <strong>as a result</strong> you got all the answers right.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's good and there's more about this on our website at <a href=""http://www.bbclearningenglish.com"">bbclearningenglish.com</a>. Join us again for more 6 Minute Grammar.</p>

</div><br /><li><p><strong>Linking devices of cause and effect</strong></p>
<p><strong>Group 1:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Therefore, consequently, as a result, thus</strong></p>
<p>These can start the second sentence:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The population has increased.&nbsp;<strong>Consequently,</strong>&nbsp;there is not enough suitable housing.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>They can&nbsp;also combine&nbsp;two sentences with&nbsp;<strong>semi-colon + consequently + comma</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The population has increased<strong>;</strong>&nbsp;<strong>as a result,</strong>&nbsp;the government is going to build more houses.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Group 2:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Because of, as a result of, due to, owing to</strong></p>
<p>These join&nbsp;a sentence to a&nbsp;<strong>noun phrase</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The problem has increased&nbsp;<strong>owing to</strong>&nbsp;<strong>interest rate rises</strong>.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Owing to</strong>&nbsp;<strong>interest rate rises,</strong>&nbsp;the problem has increased.</em></li>

"<div class=""text"" dir=""ltr""><h3><strong>The past perfect tense<br></strong></h3>
<p>Time for 6 Minute Grammar. Join Catherine, Rob and Harry for lots of explanations and examples of the past perfect tense in action. Will you get all the quiz questions correct?</p>
</div><br />
<div class=""text"" dir=""ltr"">
<p><strong>Rob</strong><strong><br></strong>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Rob.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine <br></strong>And me, Catherine. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Today we're talking about the past perfect tense.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine <br></strong>Yes, the past perfect. When we want to talk about two things that happened at different times in the past, we can use the past perfect tense - that's a subject with <strong>had</strong> plus the <strong>past participle</strong>. And here's Harry with our first example:</p>
<p><strong>Harry &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong><strong>Mary rang John's doorbell at 8.15 yesterday, but John had gone to work.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And let's hear that again.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Harry &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong><strong>Mary rang John's doorbell at 8.15 yesterday, but John had gone to work.</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Thanks Harry. Now we could put these two events in the past simple tense, something like this:</p>
<p><strong>Harry &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong><strong>John went to work. Then Mary rang John's doorbell.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>And once again Harry.</p>
<p><strong>Harry &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong><strong>John went to work. Then Mary rang John's doorbell.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Or, we can change the order of events in the sentence, and use the past perfect - that's <strong>had </strong>with a <strong>past participle</strong> - to show which event actually happened first.</p>
<p><strong>Harry &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong><strong>Mary rang John's doorbell at 8.15 yesterday, but John had gone to work.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And once again.</p>
<p><strong>Harry &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong><strong>Mary rang John's doorbell at 8.15 yesterday, but John had gone to work.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>And here, the past perfect in <strong>John had gone</strong> shows that this happened before the past simple phrase <strong>Mary rang John's doorbell</strong>. So we have: <strong>Mary rang John's doorbell at 8.15 yesterday, but John had gone to work.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Exactly. Now, let's look at some more examples.</p>
<p><strong>Harry &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong><strong>I was pleased when I got a text from Jim, because I'd lost his number.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>Let's hear that again.</p>
<p><strong>Harry &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong><strong>I was pleased when I got a text from Jim, because I'd lost his number.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>So we've got two past events. First, Harry lost Jim's number; then he got his text. But in Harry's sentence, the event that happened first in time is mentioned second in the sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Rob &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>So he uses the past perfect - <strong>I'd lost his number</strong> - to show that the second event he mentions, actually happened first.</p>
<p><strong>Harry &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong><strong>I was pleased when I got a text from Jim, because I'd lost his number.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Now in spoken English, the past perfect can sometimes be difficult to hear.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Yes that's true - in our example just now, the two words <strong>I had</strong> are shortened to <strong>I'd</strong>. I'd lost his number.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>So <strong>had</strong> is shortened to just a /d/ sound. Listen out for the short /d/ sound in this next example:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Harry &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong><strong>When Mrs Brown opened the washing machine she realised she'd washed her phone.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>And again.</p>
<p><strong>Harry &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong><strong>When Mrs Brown opened the washing machine she realised she'd washed her phone.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br>Did you catch that?</p>
<p><strong>Rob<br></strong>First, Mrs Brown washed her phone in the washing machine. Then she opened the washing machine. Then she realised... She'd washed her phone!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, and the phrase <strong>she had washed</strong> is shortened to <strong>she'd washed</strong>. One more time please Harry.</p>
<p><strong>Harry &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong><strong>When Mrs Brown opened the washing machine she realised she'd washed her phone.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Oops - that's an expensive mistake. Poor Mrs Brown!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Yeah, she won't do that again!</p>
<p><strong>IDENT &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>6 Minute Grammar from bbclearningenglish.com.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now for a quiz. I'm going to say some sentences and, as you listen, try to decide what happened first, and what happened second. Here's the first one. <strong>I woke up late because I'd forgotten to set the alarm.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>OK, so the past perfect here is <strong>I'd forgotten</strong>, and the order of events was: first, I forgot to set the alarm, and second, I woke up late. Here it is again.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Harry &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong><strong>I woke up late because I'd forgotten to set the alarm.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Great. Another one: <strong>I hadn't brought a towel, so I couldn't have a shower.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>How embarrassing. OK, and we've got the negative of had, which is <strong>hadn't</strong>. So first, I didn't bring a towel, and second, I couldn't have a shower. Here it is again.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Harry<br></strong><strong>I hadn't brought a towel, so I couldn't have a shower.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Good. And for the last one: <strong>When they got to the station, they realised they'd left the tickets at home.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rob &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>This one has three events: first, they left the tickets at home. Second, they got to the station. And third, they realised that the tickets were at home.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Yes and the past perfect phrase <strong>they had left</strong>, was shortened to <strong>they'd left</strong> - which helps us show that order.</p>
<p><strong>Harry<br></strong><strong>When they got to the station, they realised they'd left the tickets at home.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Now, a mistake people sometimes make with the past perfect is: they use it too much, or they use it just because they are talking about something that happened a long time ago. Such as...</p>
<p><strong>Harry<br></strong><strong>Jackie had gone to a football match last month.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Yes - there's only one past event here, so we probably just need the past simple tense:</p>
<p><strong>Harry<br></strong><strong>Jackie went to a football match last month.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>So that's the past perfect. It's made of <strong>had</strong> plus the <strong>past participle</strong> and we mainly use it to talk about a past event that happened before another past event.</p>

"<div class=""text"" dir=""ltr""><h3>Modals of deduction and speculation</h3>
<p>Do you know what to say when you're making a guess about a past or present situation? Join Finn and Catherine as they discuss modals in this episode of 6 Minute Grammar.</p>
</div><br /><div class=""text"" dir=""ltr"">
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me Finn.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And me Catherine. In today's programme we're having a look at modal verbs.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>Now modal verbs are used in a lot of different ways but in this programme we’re looking at the modal verbs we use when we're talking about things we think are possible or true – both in the present and in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right. When we don't know something for sure, we often make guesses. And modal verbs can express how sure or unsure we are about our guesses. We'll give you lots of examples…</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>And we’ll check what you've learned in our quiz.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>But first, we're listening to Fiona, who is a science reporter. And Fiona is talking about some ancient fossils that were found in China and Taiwan.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>While you listen, think about this question: Are the fossils from humans?</p>
<p><strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Fiona<br></strong>The research teams analysing fossils found in China and Taiwan&nbsp;<strong>could be looking</strong>&nbsp;at something very important. It seems that the fossils&nbsp;<strong>can't be</strong>&nbsp;from any known human species. They&nbsp;<strong>might be</strong>&nbsp;the result of breeding between species or they&nbsp;<strong>may belong</strong>&nbsp;to an unknown human species. The fossils suggest that before modern humans arrived in Asia, more diverse human groups&nbsp;<strong>may have lived</strong>&nbsp;there than previously thought.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>So that was Fiona. And we asked you: Are the fossils from humans?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answer is: Maybe. They&nbsp;<strong>might be</strong>&nbsp;the result of breeding between species or they&nbsp;<strong>may belong</strong>&nbsp;to an unknown human species.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>So we don't know the answer for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly. Now the modal verbs&nbsp;<strong>might</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>may&nbsp;</strong>plus an infinitive show that we're talking about a present possibility, not a certainty. The modal verb&nbsp;<strong>could</strong>&nbsp;does this too, either with an infinitive or with a continuous form. Here's an example.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br></strong>The research teams analysing fossils found in China and Taiwan&nbsp;<strong>could be looking</strong>&nbsp;at something very important…</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>In fact, we can say&nbsp;<strong>could be looking, might be looking</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>may be looking</strong>&nbsp;there.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right: it's a modal verb plus the continuous form of&nbsp;<strong>be</strong>&nbsp;plus&nbsp;<strong>verb–ing</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>But what about this sentence? Listen.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br></strong>It seems that the fossils&nbsp;<strong>can't be</strong>&nbsp;from any known human species.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Fiona uses the modal&nbsp;<strong>can’t&nbsp;</strong>there. Now we use&nbsp;<strong>can't&nbsp;</strong>with an infinitive when we believe strongly that something isn't possible. The researchers believe strongly that the fossils don't belong to any known human species. They&nbsp;<strong>can't</strong>&nbsp;come from a known human species – it's not possible.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>So they&nbsp;<strong>must be</strong>&nbsp;from an unknown human species.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right.&nbsp;<strong>Must&nbsp;</strong>or<strong>&nbsp;can't&nbsp;</strong>plus an infinitive both help us to express a strong belief that something is or isn't possible.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>When we're less sure about something, we can say, for example, the fossils&nbsp;<strong>might not, mightn’t&nbsp;</strong>or<strong>&nbsp;may not be</strong>&nbsp;from a known human species.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right, but don’t use the negative&nbsp;<strong>couldn't</strong>&nbsp;like this. It's different.&nbsp;<strong>Couldn't</strong>&nbsp;plus an infinitive means that something is completely impossible. Right then. Now let's look at possibilities and certainties in the past. Here's the next clip.</p>
<p><strong>INSERT CLIP 3<br></strong>The fossils suggest that before modern humans arrived in Asia, more diverse human groups&nbsp;<strong>may have lived</strong>&nbsp;there than previously thought.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>So we can also use&nbsp;<strong>might, may, could, can't</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>must</strong>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<strong>have</strong>&nbsp;and the past participle of the verb when we think something was possible in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, we can say&nbsp;<strong>may have lived, might have lived&nbsp;</strong>or<strong>&nbsp;could have lived</strong>&nbsp;to express past possibility.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>And we use<strong>&nbsp;can't&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>must&nbsp;</strong>with&nbsp;<strong>have</strong>&nbsp;and the past participle when we're&nbsp;<strong>certain</strong>&nbsp;about something in the past. For example,&nbsp;<strong>t</strong><strong>he scientists can't have expected to find anything so important</strong>.<strong> &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly.&nbsp;<strong>They must have been very excited</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>I'm sure they were!</p>
<p><strong>IDENT</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>6 Minute Grammar from BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>And we're talking about modal verbs.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And it's quiz time! For each of these sentences, choose&nbsp;<strong>might</strong>,<strong> must</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>can’t</strong>&nbsp;to fill the gap: Number one: Finn, you got an A grade in physics? Wow. You _____ have studied really hard.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>And the answer is&nbsp;<strong>must</strong>. You must have studied really hard. I did Catherine.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong><br>Very good, Finn! Number two: Nick just called. He is stuck in traffic: he _____ be late.</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong><br>And this one is&nbsp;<strong>might</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>He might be late</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well done! Number three: You _____ have seen a ghost. There's no such thing.</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>And the answer is&nbsp;<strong>can't.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>You can’t have seen a ghost.&nbsp;</strong>There's no such thing. Is there Catherine?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>I don't think so, Finn. What about you?</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong>No.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>We don’t believe in ghosts. And that's the end of the quiz. I hope you got them all right. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>And me, Catherine. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Now, Catherine, would you like to have some of this delicious chocolate I've got here?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Oh Neil, I'd love to but I can't. When I eat chocolate, I get terrible headaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Oh that's bad luck! If I eat a lot of chocolate, I just get fat!&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Do you? You don't look it, you look thin!</p>
<p><strong>Neil &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>It's all the cycling you see. I can eat whatever I want because of all the cycling.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br> </strong>Lucky you.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Now, in this programme, we're looking at the zero conditional and the first conditional.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>We'll be discussing why and when we use them.</p>
<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>We'll see how to form them...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>We'll help you decide which one to use in which situation...</p>
<p><strong>Neil &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>And we'll bring you a quiz at the end of the show.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>So listen carefully - and take some notes!</p>
<p><strong>Neil &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Let's start by looking at the zero conditional. We use it to talk about things which always happen in particular situations.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>For example,<strong> I always get a headache if I eat chocolate.</strong> We also use the zero conditional to talk about facts and truths. And here's Finn with our first example.</p>
<p><strong>Finn&nbsp;<br></strong><strong>If you drop an apple, it falls to the ground.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>That's gravity for you! Now, there are two parts to the sentence. The part with <strong>if</strong> plus the <strong>present simple</strong> tells us the situation, and the other part is in the present simple tense, and tells us what happens as a result of the<strong> if</strong> situation. Here's Finn with an example of the <strong>if</strong> situation:</p>
<p><strong>Finn &nbsp;<br></strong><strong>If you drop an apple</strong>...</p>
<p>And I'll say that again: <strong>If you drop an apple</strong>...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>And the result:</p>
<p><strong>Finn &nbsp;<br></strong>...<strong>it falls to the ground.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>Once more:</p>
<p><strong>Finn &nbsp;<br></strong>...<strong>it falls to the ground.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>And this result happens every time the situation happens. Isn't that right, Catherine?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>That's correct Neil. It's a scientific fact - and it was first identified by Isaac Newton, I believe.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>I think you're right! So that's the zero conditional. Let's compare it with an example of the first conditional. Finn.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finn&nbsp;<br></strong><strong>If you drop that glass, it'll break.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And once again:</p>
<p><strong>Finn&nbsp;<br></strong><strong>If you drop that glass, it'll break.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Now, in this sentence the <strong>if</strong> plus present simple part gives us a possible future situation. The other part is made with <strong>will</strong> plus an <strong>infinitive</strong> <strong>without 'to'</strong> and it gives us the result of this possible future situation.</p>
<p><strong>Finn &nbsp;<br></strong><strong>If you drop that glass</strong>...</p>
<p><strong>If you drop that glass</strong>...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>And this is only a possible situation.</p>
<p><strong>Finn &nbsp;<br></strong>...<strong>it'll break.</strong></p>
<p>...<strong>it'll break.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>And this is the result of the situation. We use <strong>will</strong> to show we are certain that the glass will break. But it only breaks if we drop the glass.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>When we are less certain of the result we can use <strong>might</strong>, like this:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Finn &nbsp;<br></strong>If you drop the glass, it <strong>might</strong> break.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>And once again:</p>
<p><strong>Finn &nbsp;<br></strong>If you drop the glass, it <strong>might</strong> break.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>It's sometimes difficult to choose between the zero and first conditional. It helps to remember that as well as using the zero conditional for truths, we also use it for general situations. If you're talking about a specific situation, or a one-off situation, the first conditional is probably best. For example, to describe a general situation that is true for everyone, we can use the zero conditional to say:</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong><strong>If you sit in the sun too long, you get burned.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine<br></strong>But if your friend is about to go sunbathing, perhaps without any sun cream, you can use the first conditional to talk about that specific situation and its possible result, like this:</p>
<p><strong>Finn<br></strong><strong>If you sit in the sun too long, you will get burned.</strong></p>
<p><strong>IDENT &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></strong>6 Minute Grammar from BBC Learning English.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>And it's quiz time! Are these sentences grammatically correct, or wrong? Here's the first one: When we're older, we'll go travelling.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>OK, this first conditional sentence is correct.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Good. Here's another one: If plants don't get water, they die.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>This sentence is correct too.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>OK, get ready for the last sentence: If I fail my exams again, I feel terrible.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>And that's wrong. It's a specific situation and it's describing a possibility, not a certainty. So we need the first conditional. Here's the correct sentence:<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp; <br>If I fail my exams again, I<strong> will </strong>feel terrible.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Now, before we go, there's just enough time for a top tip. The first conditional only has one 'will'. So this sentence is wrong:</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp; <br>If <strong>they will leave </strong>now, they'll be home for lunch.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>You need to use present simple without will in the <strong>if</strong> part. Here's the correct version:</p>
<p><strong>Finn</strong>&nbsp; <br>If <strong>they leave </strong>now, they'll be home for lunch.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catherine &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong>Thank you Finn. So that's the zero conditional, with the present tense in both parts, for things which always happen.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>And that's the first conditional with <strong>if</strong> plus present simple, together with <strong>will</strong>, plus an infinitive, for possible future situations.</p>

<p><strong>Both</strong>&nbsp;<br>Bye.</p>
</div><br /><li><p><strong>Form</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zero condtional</strong></p>
<p>Both parts of the sentence are in the present simple</p>
<p><em>If&nbsp;<strong>you work&nbsp;</strong>on the computer too long,&nbsp;<strong>your eyes start</strong>&nbsp;hurting.<br><strong>I&nbsp;get</strong>&nbsp;terrible headaches when&nbsp;<strong>I&nbsp;eat</strong>&nbsp;chocolate.</em></p>
<p>The two parts can come in any order</p>
<p><em><strong>Your eyes start</strong>&nbsp;hurting if&nbsp;<strong>you work</strong>&nbsp;on the computer too long.</em><br><em>When&nbsp;<strong>I eat</strong>&nbsp;chocolate,&nbsp;<strong>I get</strong>&nbsp;terrible headaches.</em></p>
<p><strong>First conditional</strong></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>if/when&nbsp;</strong>part of the sentence is in present simple. The&nbsp;<strong>result&nbsp;</strong>part is&nbsp;<strong>will + infinitive (without 'to')</strong></p>
<p><em>If&nbsp;<strong>you drop</strong>&nbsp;that glass,&nbsp;<strong>it will break</strong>.</em><br><em><strong>I'll go</strong>&nbsp;home when&nbsp;<strong>I finish</strong>&nbsp;work.</em></p>
<p>The two parts can come in any order</p>
<p><em><strong>That glass will break</strong>&nbsp;if&nbsp;<strong>you drop</strong>&nbsp;it.</em><br><em>When&nbsp;<strong>I finish</strong>&nbsp;work,<strong>&nbsp;I'll go</strong>&nbsp;home.</em></p>
<p><strong>Meaning</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zero conditional</strong></p>
<p>Use the first conditional for&nbsp;<strong>facts</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;things that are generally true or that you believe to be true</strong>. You can use if or when and the meaning doesn't change.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p><em>When it rains, the ground gets wet.<br>If you drink a lot of fizzy drinks, your teeth get damaged.<br></em><em>I get a stomachache if I eat too much cake.</em></p>
<p><strong>First conditional</strong></p>
<p>Use the first conditional for&nbsp;<strong>possible future results of an action or situation</strong>. Using&nbsp;<strong>if</strong>&nbsp;means that we are not sure about the possible result. Using&nbsp;<strong>when&nbsp;</strong>means we think the possible result is more likely.</p>
<p><em>If you don't take an umbrella, you'll get wet.<br></em><em>We'll be late if we don't leave soon!</em><br><em>I'll tell you the good news when I see you.</em></p>

"<div class=""text"" dir=""ltr""><h3>Phrasals</h3>
<p>To separate or not to separate? Finn and Catherine look into phrasal and prepositional verbs in 6 Minute Grammar. Listen to the examples and see if you can pick up the rules.</p>
</div><br /><div class=""text"" dir=""ltr"">
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar. I'm Finn…</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And I'm Catherine. And today we're talking about phrasal verbs and prepositional verbs.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Yes, we'll explain what they are and how you use them...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>We'll have lots of examples and of course we'll finish with a quiz.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>But first, let's listen to Mary. She's a lifestyle coach and she has some advice for us about friends and friendship.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And listen out for the answer to this question: What do psychologists say that it is important to do?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<br></span></strong><span><strong>Mary<br></strong>How often do you and your friends <strong>get together</strong>? In our busy lives today, it's easy to <strong>let our </strong>friends <strong>down</strong> by <strong>putting off</strong> social arrangements or even forgetting to <strong>ring</strong> them <strong>up</strong>. Yet our friends are the people who <strong>stand by </strong>us when we need support. So while it's great to <strong>keep up with</strong> people on social media, psychologists <strong>point out</strong> that it's really important to make time to <strong>meet up</strong> together too.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>So that was Mary. And we asked: What do psychologists say that it is important to do?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And the answer is: They say it's important for us and our friends to <strong>meet up</strong>. And I think they mean face to face. What do you think, Finn?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finn<br></strong></span><span>They do. Face-to-face meeting up is the best thing, they say. And there's our first phrasal verb - <strong>meet up</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Yes, meet up. Now, a phrasal verb is a two-word verb made of a verb plus a little word like <strong>in</strong>,<strong> on</strong>,<strong> out</strong>, or<strong> up</strong>. We usually think of<strong> in</strong>,<strong> on</strong>,<strong> out</strong>, and<strong> up</strong> as prepositions, but in phrasal verbs they behave more like adverbs.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br><span>They do. In the phrasal verb <strong>meet up</strong>, the adverb <strong>up</strong> modifies the meaning of the verb <strong>meet</strong>. <strong>Meet</strong> and <strong>meet up</strong> are very similar in meaning. But the adverb sometimes does more than that. Listen to this clip.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<br></span></strong><strong><span>Mary<br></span></strong><span>...psychologists <strong>point out</strong> that it's really important to make time to <strong>meet up</strong> together too.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Right, we heard the phrasal verb <strong>point out</strong> there, but it doesn't mean the same as the verb <strong>point</strong>. <strong>Point out</strong> means to say something interesting, or unusual or useful. And the adverb changes the meaning significantly. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>It does. Now listen out for more phrasal verbs in this clip.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<br></span></strong><span><strong>Mary&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></strong>In our busy lives today, it's easy to <strong>let </strong>our friends <strong>down</strong> by <strong>putting off</strong> social arrangements or even forgetting to <strong>ring</strong> them <strong>up</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Now if we <strong>let</strong> our friends <strong>down</strong>, it means that we don't help or support them. And when we <strong>put off</strong> arrangements, we cancel or delay them. And if we <strong>ring</strong> people <strong>up</strong>, we phone them.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And those are interesting phrasal verbs because when they have an object, we can put the object either between the verb and the adverb, or we can put it after the adverb.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>Like this: we can <strong>let our friends down</strong> or we can&nbsp;<strong>let down our friends</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>You wouldn't let your friends down.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>I'd never let my friends down, Catherine. Or my colleagues.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And we can <strong>put off arrangements</strong> or <strong>put arrangements off</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>We can. But be careful. If the object is a pronoun, you have to put it in the middle. For example, you have to say <strong>ring them up</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Yeah. Don't say <strong>ring up them</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>No, don't say that. Now, one more clip. Can you spot any more phrasal verbs?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>INSERT<br></span></strong><span><strong>Mary<br></strong></span><span>Yet our friends are the people who <strong>stand by us</strong> when we need support.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>Well, we just heard<strong> stand by us.</strong> And you are probably wondering why the pronoun is at the end of the verb because we just said that you can't put pronouns at the end. But <strong>stand by</strong> is a slightly different type of verb, because <strong>by</strong> isn't an adverb. It's a preposition.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>That's right. In some two-word verbs, the second word such as <strong>by</strong>,<strong> with</strong>,<strong> into</strong>, or<strong> on </strong>behaves like a preposition, not an adverb. And in these verbs, the object or object pronoun always comes after the preposition.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>OK. So Mary said that it's great to <strong>keep up with</strong> people on social media. And&nbsp;<strong>keep up with</strong> means <strong>keep in contact with</strong>, and it's a phrasal verb made of three parts: a verb: <strong>keep</strong>, plus an adverb: <strong>up</strong>, plus a preposition: <strong>with</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>That's right. And with phrasal verbs with three parts, the object always comes at the end. We <strong>keep up with people</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>IDENT</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>6 Minute Grammar from the BBC.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And it's time for a quiz! Number one. Is this sentence correct or wrong? She took her coat off, hung it up and sat down. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>That's correct. Number two: correct or wrong? We keep with each other up by phone and email.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>And that one is wrong...</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn<br></span></strong><span>I know.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>...sounds horrible! The correct sentence is: We keep up with each other by phone and email. So, number three: I turned down the job because it was too far away. Now the question is: can you also say a) I turned down it. Or b) I turned it down?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Finn</span></strong><br><span>Well, this time you can say b) I turned it down. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Catherine<br></span></strong><span>You can. And very good if you got those right at home. &nbsp;</span></p>

</div><br /><li><p><strong>Form of multi-word verbs</strong></p>
<p><strong>No object</strong></p>
<p><em>Are you <strong>going away</strong> on holiday this year?</em></p>
<p><strong>Noun object</strong></p>
<p><em>I can’t wait to <strong>look around</strong> <strong>Athens</strong>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Object pronoun after the verb</strong></p>

<p><em>Is someone <strong>picking you up</strong> at the airport?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Phrasal verbs with direct objects</strong></p>
<p>The noun object can usually go before or after the adverb.</p>
<p><em>I <strong>broke off</strong> our engagement.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>OR</em></strong></p>
