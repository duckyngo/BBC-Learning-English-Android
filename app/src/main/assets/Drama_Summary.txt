" <h3>The last leg</h3>
 <p>&quot;We were sailing through a huge hurricane when a massive wave hit us. Oh why did I try to sail through this storm? I was hoping to get back home in 80 days but that seems impossible now. I must make sure my crew is ok – I need them now more than ever.&quot;</p>
 "
" <h3>Plain sailing</h3>
 <p>&quot;It's a miracle! I didn't hit any rocks and we are safe in the harbour at Papeete on the island of Tahiti. It's just a quick stop to clean up the yacht and take on fresh water. I'm going to find one more souvenir to take home as part of my challenge.&quot;</p>

 "
" <h3>All at sea!</h3>
 <p>&quot;We've just missed being hit by a huge container ship. We're all so tired and we didn't see it coming. We've been at sea for several days and without our satellite navigation system it's hard to know which way we're going. Passepartout needs medical help - and we have to get more food supplies. We must find land soon.&quot;</p>
 "
" <h3>All at sea!</h3>
 <p>&quot;It's day 15. We're in Sao Tome and trying to smuggle our new friend Sophia off the island and onto our boat. She wants to escape from her violent husband and return to her home in the UK. I'm always happy to help someone in distress. But there's no time to hang around – I only have 65 days left to sail around the world.&quot;</p>
 "
" <h3>Any port in a storm</h3>
 <p>&quot;We're in the Cape Verde islands and, no, we didn't sink! We have made it to port. Unfortunately, we can't stay here for long – we are in a race after all, around the world!&quot;</p>
 "
" <h3>Start the clock!</h3>
 <p>&quot;It's Phil here. You may know that I've been set a challenge to sail around the world in 80 days – it's an impossible challenge especially as I have never sailed a yacht before. But I said 'yes' – so here goes!&quot;</p>
 "
" <h3>The challenge is set</h3>
 <p>&quot;Hello, I'm Phil. I'm about to face a challenge that could give me a great adventure – and a lot of money. What could it be? Find out now in episode one of The Race.&quot;</p>
