 <p><strong>to boo – '…you can all boo if you like'<br /></strong>to make a noise like this: <em>Boooooo! </em>This noise is called <em>a boo</em>.

 <p><strong>It's gone [a certain time] - 'It's gone two o'clock!'</strong><br />informal expression meaning that it’s later than this time. We often use it when we are&nbsp;late or delayed.</p>

 <p><strong>Scene 6</strong></p>
 <p><strong>politically correct – 'I'm not sure that's still a politically correct term'<br /></strong>if language is politically correct, it isn't offensive to minority groups and is seen as a&nbsp;reasonable way of talking about something or someone.

 <p><strong>a shambles – 'this is all a complete shambles'<br /></strong>informal - something which is very badly organised, or very messy.

 <p><strong>niggling – '…which deals with all those niggling questions about the English&nbsp;</strong><strong>language…'<br /></strong>if something niggles, it annoys you slightly over a long period of time, so <em>niggling&nbsp;</em><em>doubts </em>are worries that don't go away, and <em>niggling questions </em>are questions you can't&nbsp;find an answer to. Note that <em>to niggle </em>also means to ask too many questions or have&nbsp;too many doubts, e.g.:<br /><em>It's really good news – stop niggling!</em></p>
 <p><strong>specifically – '…aimed specifically at English language learners'<br /></strong>especially</p>
 <p><strong>to come over – 'I'm not sure what came over me then…'<br /></strong>A way of describing unexpected changes of mood, feeling or behaviour, e.g.:<br /><em>She suddenly came over very dizzy and had to sit down.<br /></em><em>I don't know what’s come over her recently – she's been acting really weird…</em></p>
 <p><strong>Scene 7</strong></p>
 <p><strong>a copycat – 'I've always been a pretty good copycat…'<br /></strong>this is an informal, negative word for someone who copies someone else's work or style. It is being used in a humorous way here, since the rat is imitating a cat.</p>
 <p><strong>come in … over… Roger that<br /></strong>these are traditional ways of talking on walkie-talkies or radios. <em>Come in </em>means <em>speak&nbsp;</em><em>now</em>; <em>over </em>means <em>I've finished talking </em>and <em>Roger </em>means <em>I understand</em>.</p>
 <p><strong>Scene 8</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Derring-do<br /></strong>an old-fashioned, humorous word for acts of bravery. e.g.:<br /><em>These accounts show the derring-do of ordinary soldiers in 1916.</em></p>
 <p><strong>crackle … rustle … swish ... smack<br /></strong>These are onomatopoeic nouns: they each describe the noise that they sound like. There are also verb forms of these, e.g.:<br /><em>The leaves are rustling in the trees.</em></p>

 <p><strong>ordeal – 'I thought about you for every waking second of my ordeal!'<br /></strong>a very bad experience. We often use <em>to go through </em>or <em>to get through </em>with this word, e.g.:<br /><em>They're going through a really terrible ordeal.<br /></em><em>If we can get through this ordeal, we can achieve anything!</em></p>
 <p><strong>To scram – '…we need to scram before Franky comes back!'<br /></strong>informal word meaning <em>to run away </em>or <em>leave quickly</em></p>
 <p><strong>to hand over something / someone – 'Hand over the gun, Franky'<br /></strong>to give somebody something or someone</p>
 <p><strong>Scene 9</strong></p>
 <p><strong>'All's Well That Ends'<br /></strong>This is a humorous misuse of the Shakespearian phrase <em>All's well that ends well </em>– which means that a happy ending to something is more important than how it is achieved</p>
 <p><strong>the fairest – 'Who's the fairest of them all?'<br /></strong>an old-fashioned word meaning <em>the most beautiful</em></p>
 <p><strong>swell – '…a swell girl like you…'<br /></strong>American slang meaning great, super</p>
 <p><strong>would never be seen dead – '…a swell girl like you would never be seen dead&nbsp;</strong><strong>with an ordinary guy like me'<br /></strong>would hate to be seen by people in that situation, e.g.:<br /><em>I wouldn't be seen dead wearing that skirt<br /></em><em>I wouldn't be seen dead with her</em></p>

 <p><strong>so-called – 'so-called 'sporting events' like this'<br /></strong>used to show that other people describe something in this way, but we don't necessarily agree with their words. Apple does not think that hunting rats should be called a 'sport'.</p>
 <p><strong>to retain – '… we have retained false ideas … about our fellow creatures'<br /></strong>a formal word, meaning <em>to keep</em></p>
 <p><strong>a stereotype – '…false ideas and stereotypes about our fellow creatures'<br /></strong>(negative) an idea which is commonly thought about a group of people, but which is not true of everyone in that group, e.g.:<br /><em>It's such a stereotype that British people only eat fish and chips</em></p>
 <p><strong>fellow – '…about our fellow creatures…'<br /></strong>an adjective describing someone who has a similarity to you: cats, rats and humans are all creatures</p>
 <p><strong>the Plague – 'What about the Plague then?'<br /></strong>the Great Plague was a disease that killed around 100,000 people in England in 1665. It was spread by rats. The word <em>plague </em>is still used to describe a disease that causes fever, swelling and death.</p>
 <p><strong>to get over something – '…we need to get over the Plague…'<br /></strong>informal, to gradually recover from something:<br /><em>I'm cautious about getting into another serious relationship at the moment. I've only j</em><em>ust got over my last boyfriend.<br /></em><em>It took years for her to get over the shock.<br /></em>Apple is using the phrase to mean <em>to accept something</em>, e.g.:<br /><em>Look, I don't like your friends, all right?! Get over it!</em></p>
